im going back to 505
if its a seven hour flight or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination youre waitin lyin on your side
with your hands between your thighs

verse
stop and wait a sec
and when you look at me like that my darlin
what did you expect
id probably still adore you
with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked
not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought
that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though
its no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure
such a perfect place to start

chorus
im going back to 505
if its a seven hour flight or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination youre waitin lyin on your side
with your hands between your thighs
you might also likebridge
but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again youve had to greet me with goodbye
im always just about to go and spoil the surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

chorus
im going back to 505
if its a seven hour flight or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination youre waitin lyin on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile300embed"
