i wanna hate you cause i still love you
and its weighing on my chest
we keep our bodies tied together
to ignore whats coming next

but i couldnt bring myself to say goodbye
i was driving you home in the middle of the night
and theres no good way yeah theres no good way

you got that something that i never wanna lose lose yeah
its like dancing when the songs already over
moving without getting any closer oh
im chasing fire when im running after you
