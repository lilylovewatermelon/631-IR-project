two for the pain and three for the show
you put your life on hold chasin layaway dreams
that aint all they seem
with a hotel heart just tryin to find a spark

electric rodeo
were paintin on our suits
were pluggin in our boots
were ridin high tonight
on acapulco gold
and the rhinestones shine
just as bright as diamonds
underneath the lights
electric rodeo

aint got no hometown
we never stop we just slow down
always a couple of drinks ahead of the world
second row pretty girls we turn em on
and then were gone

electric rodeo
were paintin on our suits
were pluggin in our boots
were ridin high tonight
on acapulco gold
and the rhinestones shine
just as bright as diamonds
underneath the lights
electric rodeo
see midland liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeyou cant see the stars
sittin in a bar
nobodys callin you home
your familys the crowd
til the lights all go out
and youre left in the dark all alone

electric rodeo
were paintin on our suits
were pluggin in our boots
were ridin high tonight
on acapulco gold
and the rhinestones shine
just as bright as diamonds
underneath the lights
electric rodeo
