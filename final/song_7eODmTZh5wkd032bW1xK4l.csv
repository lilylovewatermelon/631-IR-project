and when i see you i really see you upside down
but my brain knows better it picks you up and turns you around
turns you around turns you around
if you feel discouraged that theres a lack of color here
please dont worry lover its really bursting at the seams
from absorbing everything the spectrums a to z

interlude
ahah ahah
ahah ahah ahah

verse 2
this is fact not fiction for the first time in years
and all the girls in every girly magazine cant make me feel
any less alone im reaching for the phone

bridge
to call at 703
and on your machine i slur a plea for you to come home
but i know its too late
and i should have given you a reason to stay
given you a reason to stay
given you a reason to stay
given you a reason to stay
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likeoutro
