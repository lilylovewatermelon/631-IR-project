i cannot leave here i cannot stay
forever haunted more than afraid
asphyxiate on words i would say
im drawn to a blackened sky as i turn blue

hook
there are no flowers no not this time
therell be no angels gracing the lines
just these stark words i find
id show a smile but im too weak
id share with you could i only speak
just how much this hurts me

verse 2
i cannot stay here i cannot leave
just like all i loved im make believe
imagine heart i disappear
seems no one will appear here and make me real

hook
there are no flowers no not this time
therell be no angels gracing the lines
just these stark words i find
id show a smile but im too weak
id share with you could i only speak
just how much this hurts me

id tell you how it haunts me
id tell you how it haunts me
cuts through my days and sinks into my dreams
id tell you how it haunts me
cuts through my days and sinks into my dreams
you dont care that it haunts me

hook
there are no flowers no not this time
therell be no angels gracing the lines
just these stark words i find
id show a smile but im too weak
id share with you could i only speak
just how much this hurts me

just how much this hurts me
just how much you5embed"
