deep inside secrets burning
should have known all the while whats true
i went along to fool myself
cant go on i cant escape it

chorus
all along
i think i really knew
it was there in the words unspoken
all along
still believed in you
now im leaving here betrayed and broken

verse 2
close my eyes from the burning
all along all the while its true
take it on or turn your back
either way you cant escape it

chorus
all along
i think i really knew
it was there in the words unspoken
all along
still believed in you
now im leaving here betrayed and broken

ooooh
ooooh

chorus
all along
i think i really knew
it was there in the words unspoken
all along
still believed in you
now im leaving here betrayed and broken
