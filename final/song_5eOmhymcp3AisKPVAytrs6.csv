verse 1 kendrick lamar
i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalized
my intuition had said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressin my daddy tired
i need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried to save me
how im gon listen when i dont even hear god
heaven or hell base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
the same nigga that kill with youll squeal with you
i deal with you like my son stare at the sun
and youll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway this for my niggas
uncles twentythree hours sendin me pictures
i want you to know that im so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metro pc phone then you went back in
so when i touch the pen the pen is in my view
ima get it right just so you

and i do this for the city

fuck the police they gon have to come and get me

verse 2 kendrick lamar
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
the same nigga that kill with youll squeal with you
i like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
im twentythree with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich but wealthy theres nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful
the city got my back and for that i give them my torso
you think about it and dont call me lyrical
cause really im just a nigga thats evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worrisome individuals that live life critical
so wont you bear witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on wanna be heard probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me gettin what i deserve
somebody said my name on the radio
he aint know i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
he probably be out of work laid back while he

outro glc
church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
cause the ism is enormous you know what im talking bout
we out here rotating under the five ps
proper preparation prevents poor performance you know what im talking bout
doing my thing cause im rotating with my speakers thumping
from the windy city streets all the way out here to the streets of compton
know what im talking bout
church is definitely on the move and we gon continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
as i rotate with my true player partner by the name of kendrick lamar you know what im talking bout
this is the ism this is the vision you know what im talking bout
gotta get up off your ass and get it man
thats the only way your pockets gon expand
i tell you everyday you know what im talking bout
apply yourself to supply your wealth
only limitations youll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
church is definitely on the move you know what im talking bout
exercise your ism and dont depend on no one else
