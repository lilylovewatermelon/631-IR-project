it was always me versus the world
until i found its me versus me
why why why why
why why why why
just remember what happens on earth stays on earth
we gon put it in reverse

and i am telling you once again
just to remind you sweetheart

verse kendrick lamar
oh lamar
hail mary and marijuana times is hard
pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives im a star
life is one funny mafucker
a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
i might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest povertys dialect
adaptation inevitable gun violence crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
wellrespected calm and collected
laughin and jokin made life easier hard times mama on crack
a fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
his family history pimpin and bangin
he was meant to be dangerous clocked him a grip and start slangin
fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman workin for his big homie
smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
tenthousand dollars out of a project housing thats on the daily
seen his first mill twenty years old had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters caught a murder case
fingerprints on the gun they assumin but witnesses couldnt prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin
birdshufflin anthony rang
the first in the projects with the twotone mustang that 50 thing they say 50 came circlin parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see at this chicken spot there was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth he worked the window
his name was ducky he came from the streets the robert taylor homes
southside projects chiraq the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and fivehundred dollars
they had a son hopin that hed see college
hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
cadillac seville hed ride his son around on weekends
threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
cross the street from the projects anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before back in 84
thats when affiliation was really at gears of war
so many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works killin us crime
intelligent felonious prevalent proposition with 9s
ducky was wellaware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured hed get on these niggas good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line two extra biscuits
anthony liked him and then let him slide they didnt kill him
in fact it look like theyre the last to survive pay attention
that one decision changed both of they lives one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma and ill tell you why
you take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin their benefits
then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
because if anthony killed ducky top dawg could be servin life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
gunshot
