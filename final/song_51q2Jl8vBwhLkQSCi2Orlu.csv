its all on me its my mistake
i said i dont love you a little too late
but i guess there aint ever a right time
and i dont know why its called a goodbye
go run my name into the ground
tell everyone you know just how
how i slammed the door on our forever
but i promise you its for the better

chorus both carly pearce
i hope you find what you were lookin for
i hope your heart aint hurtin anymore
and you get movin on all figured out
and you dont hate me somehow
cause i hope youre happy now

verse 2 lee brice both
who knew this heart could break this hard
or a love like ours could fall apart
without so much as a warnin
i thought that i was what you wanted

chorus both lee brice
well i guess you found what you were lookin for
i guess my heart aint worth it anymore
im a wreck im a mess
and i aint got nothin left
