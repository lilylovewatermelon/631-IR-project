she said were only young once
the back of a chevrolet hey now on the radio
ashes in the tray
you can only get drunk once
on this kind of naivety
who knows how long we’re always gonna feel this way

prechorus
time goes by and itll dull the razor
and we dont know why
let’s worry bout that later
cause if we never do nothin else stupid
if we never do nothin else stupid
at least we know someday
that we can look back and say
we were young once

chorus
we were young once
we were gungho singin in the sun once
backroads in the wild on the run once
cheap thrills doing things in the wheat fields
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young once
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeverse 2
she said lets get a cheap hotel
and make out in the hall
ill cover up your mouth and play it cool if my parents call
let’s get lost tonight
before the world’s too small
someday were gonna know too much to know it all

prechorus
time goes by and it’ll dull the razor
and we dont know why
lets worry bout that later
’cause if we never do nothin else stupid
if we never do nothin else stupid
at least we know someday
we can look back and say
we were young once

chorus
we were young once
we were gungho singin in the sun once
backroads in the wild on the run once
cheap thrills doing things in the wheat fields
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young we were young we were young once
bridge
we were young once
we were young once

chorus
we were young once
we were gungho singin in the sun once
backroads in the wild on the run once
cheap thrills doing things in the wheat fields
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young we were young we were young once
we were gungho singin in the sun once
backroads in the wild on the run once
cheap thrills doing things in the wheat fields
we were young we were young we were young once
we were young we were young we were young onceembed"
