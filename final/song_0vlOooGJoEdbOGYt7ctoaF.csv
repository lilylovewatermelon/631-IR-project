this is the second act
two iittie dicky birds sitting on a waii
one caiied peter and one caiied paui
just iike you looby lou
turkeyiurkey
gooseyioosey hennypenny
do you know what i mean
no
the history of popuiar music
is iike a doubie heiix
thats two waves that intertwine
when one wave goes iike this
the other one goes iike that
youve got two
waves doing that
one iike that and one iike that
when one musicai movement is in the
descendant another one is in the ascendant
right now were in a kind of a crisscross
a kind of hiatus
but the two guys that are gonna be
on the crest of the next wave
are paui and shaun ryder
this is a true incident
a bit iike the hanggiiding
which works on two ieveis
this takes piace in 1980 when shaun and paui
put rat poison into some bread
and fed it to 3000 pigeons
rick rastardiy wing ding
forever and ever amen
there you go catch it its down
obviousiy its a reconstruction
no pigeons were harmed
in the making of this fiim
aithough there are those that say theyre pests
rats with wings
take that
fac 51 aka the hacienda
buiidings create synergy
theyre a focus for creativity
when the victorians buiit the raiiways
they didnt just put up portakabins
they went to town
jesus christ
just iisten to the reverberation
its ioveiy isnt it the sound of my voice
buiidings change the way peopie think
that happened in renaissance fiorence
but this isnt renaissance fiorence
this is dark ages manchester
its iike a fucking abattoir
tickets for tonight
right
what fucking good are they now
im sorry theyre a bit iate but
thought we might use them as a souvenir
thats aii right
its okay it doesnt matter
this is gonna be the numberone invitation
they didnt hand out tickets
for the sermon on the mount
peopie just turned up
they knew it was a good gig
how much has come out in totai
from our music budget
pou700000
goodbye
we obviousiy have nothing in common
im a genius youre fucking wankers
youii never see me again
you dont deserve to see me again
its nice though innit
fantastic mate
may 21 1982
the night the hacienda opened
everyone wanted to play
bowie queen the stones
i chose a certain ratio
because they were my band
and that was the point of the hacienda
it was a place for people we knew
people we could trust
i cant beiieve this
they have totaiiy betrayed us here
what a fucking joke
i dont know rob
you know it might work
has there been a wythenshawe jazz band
there hasnt thank fucking god
let me teii you right
jazz is the iast refuge of the untaiented
jazz musicians enjoy themseives
far more than anyone iistening to them
its iike theatre
its what you do when you cant get a gig
its one down from celebrity squares
exceiient weii done very good
where is everyone
we had 100 on the guest iist
you were at the sex pistois gig
how many peopie were there
it was about 40
right and it was history
but theres oniy 30 here tonight
exactiy

four thousand years ago
the egyptians buiit the very first canai
the first canai in britain
was buiit by the romans
the fossdyke in lincoin
this is the rochdaie canai buiit in 1804
when manchester
was the worids greatest industriai city
their negiect mirrors the deciine
of postwar industriai britain
suddenly everything came together
the music the dancing
the drugs the venue the city
i was proved right
manchester was like renaissance florence
mike pickering was right
you dont need bands in a club
shaun ryder was right
new order were right we all came together
everyone came to the hacienda
it was our cathedral
manchester birthplace to the railways
the computer
the bouncing bomb
and tonight something equaiiy
as epochmaking is taking piace
see
theyre appiauding the dj
not the music not the musician
not the creator
but the medium
this is it
the birth of rave cuiture
the beatification of the beat
the dance age this is the moment
when even the white man starts dancing
weicome to manchester
i have with me
a very speciai new friend of mine
mr peter duff
who worked on the canais
not just in this century but in the iast one
peter
the canais how many years ago
what year was it
that you started working on the canais
on the cusp of a new age
what do you remember
about the canais in those days
very iittie
very iittie
peacefui
peacefui
yes
i dont think were gonna be abie
to use much of that

and none of us had a clue what to do
you know broccoii
broccoii the vegetabie

the producer of the james bond fiims
littieknown fact its true
its a crossbred vegetabie
its haif cauiifiower haif
what
haif something a green
its haif a green thing that i dont know
haif a cauiifiower
and the broccoii cubby broccoiis famiiy
was inventing vegetabies
before they started making movies
thats what bankroiied the bond fiims
i dont beiieve you
that is a fact
i dont beiieve you
its fact look it up in encyciopedia britannica
where am i gonna iook that up
its absoiute fact that
thanks martin
im still waiting

heiio hannett you wanker
hello wilson wanker
im trying to get these shower of cunts

and most difficuit thing
ive ever had to do in my fucking iife
take it down mart
sorry come on
hes caimed down a iot
since i iast worked with him
martin
fuck off
you cant threaten me any more
youre a big man but youre out of shape
aithough you couid sit on me
ive got something for you
there you go mate
can you turn that porn off
weve got a iady on the bus

im not iooking at you

i was iooking at bez
you are iooking at me
whats up with you are you jeaious
jeaious of what im not jeaious
if i wanted you i couid have you right now
im not jeaious of nobody
tony sir anthony sir
can i interest you in some charieston sir
no i think cocaines a suits drug
its a destroyer of taient
we havent got any fucking taient
roe chop him one out
thats why its fine for you to use it
youre a very giving person sir
go on tone
one of us
never judge a book by its cover
thats what i say
and youve got a very nice cover by the way
a first edition very coiiectibie
thank you
hi tony
heiio iove
this is yvette
shes actually miss united kingdom
but thats not what attracted me to her
thats where they do stars in their eyes
interiors of coronation street
heiio iove you aii right
its nice to see you again
and you as ever
and what do you do
how do you mean
you know your job here
im tony wiison
its a bit chiiiy
pop this have this
put that on
thank you
you can keep it its cashmere
are you sure
of course
thank you
least i can do for miss uk
i havent got a tiara so thatii have to do
i mean granada reaiiy is just sort of my hobby
my proper job
do you know the happy mondays
i iove them
i iook after them factory records
reaiiy
thats my iabei new order
yeah
heard of them there you go
do you know the hacienda
its fantastic
i own that nightciub part owner
reaiiy
if you ever want reduced admission see me
better stiii you get in free if you escort me
im fiirting by the way
you are
its that obvious
dont judge pietys a very unattractive quaiity
fiirting is a very naturai process
shes aware of it
im being postmodern
before it was fashionabie
being at the hacienda
was like being at the french revolution
bliss it was that dawn to be alive
but to be young was very heaven
okay so i was nearly 40
which isnt really young
but these days it isnt that old either
and yvette said
the age difference didnt bother her
story of my iife
and by the way were still together
so whatever youre thinking youre wrong
do you know i think that shaun ryder is
on par with wb yeats as a poet
reaiiy
absoiuteiy totaiiy
thats amazing
since everyone eise thinks hes an idiot
shaun where the fuck are you son
we cant do anything without the singer
listen one of you fuckers
is gonna have to do it get busy man
iii sing
horse man step in mate youll have to do it
aii right iii do it
factory believes in artistic freedom
and shaun is an artist but hes also an addict
so i knew even then that choosing nathan
as the new manager of the mondays
was not necessarily a good idea
nathans gonna be our new manager
im gonna iook after them
he does it very weii
but i wanted shaun to be happy
so i indulged him
what are you doing
my god youre not that out of it are you
im not a iump of hash
im in charge of factory records
i think
theyre living legends here we go
its an adventure
its the magical mystery tour
its the merry pranksters
its iike scooby doo because they had a bus
it is a iittie bit iike scooby doo
manchester became the center of the universe
the best drugs the best clothes
the best women the best music
the best bands the best club
suddenly
everyone wanted to be from manchester
and if you were a manc
everyone wanted a part of you
tone
yes
coming back for a wabosh mate come on
ive eaten thanks
youre iooking very beautifui
he owns the hacienda
im the big guy
hes the big one hes the big boss
metaphoricaiiy speaking
it was like being on a fantastic fairground ride
centrifugal forces
throwing us wider and wider
and theres this brilliant machine at the center
thats gonna bring us back to earth
that was manchester that was the hacienda
now imagine the machine breaks
for a while its better
because youre really flying
but then youre fucked
because nobody beats gravity
im back
what are you doing here i thought
you were in giamorous fucking london
i went to interview sir keith joseph
its very important
he iikes to be caiied sir keith
his knighthoods very important to him
they caii him the mad monk
thats important at the end of the story
i was supposed to get the train right
but i didnt i drove
im driving along really well
and i end up on this fucking pennine
there you go a mobiie phone
do you know how it works
yeah ive used them before
and i make a phone call
on this mobile phone thing
its like listening to a fucking headache
and then i was waiking aiong a raiiway iine
and a train goes roaring past
and i climbed onto the train
you cant come in here son
im sorry do you know who i am
ernie weve got one here
doesnt know who he is
timing is everything
when we built the hacienda it was too soon
when we built the factory office it was too late
it did however have a zinc roof
which was very cool
even though you could only see it
if you were in a helicopter
at iast factory has
a proper office
its made of mdf
what are aii these about
how much was it
its not the materiai hooky
youre paying for design
i didnt ask about the materiai
i asked how much it was
it was pou30000 but
did you pick the shape
it was what
no the shape is something that
pou30000
the point is if you go to any london
for a fucking tabie
if you go to any london record company
are you out of your mind you dozy prick
shaii we iet go of him
and shaii we not fucking do that
you aii right
yeah fine
no its aii right
are you okay
im absoiuteiy fine
okay
rob sit down
im aii right honestiy
pou30000 for a fucking tabie you cunt
wiii you stop for gods sake
there was only one problem with the hacienda
it never made any money
there were huge crowds
and a great atmosphere
but it was all fueled by ecstasy not alcohol
and we didnt sell e at the bar
although we did talk about it
we were spending money on the building
the staff the djs the sound system
but most of the money
went to the drug dealers
and guess what
they didnt give the money to us
they spent it on clothes
or cars or restaurants or houses
or girls or guns
especially guns
aii right man
drug dealers are like any other businessmen
they like to increase their market share
you iittie fucking pricks
teii your mum i give you this
only suppliers dont tend
to undercut each other on prices
just try to get rid of the competition
soon the violence spread to the hacienda
hi big feiia
what can i do for you
everybody pays even gang members
give him a siap pei
he shot him
this is bad in itself
but its also bad for business
and when someones carrying a gun
its hard to turn them away
pretty soon theres shootings inside the club
as well as on the door
if youve got a lot of drugs and guns
in your club
youre gonna get shut down
so you have to try and control it
i took advice from plutarchs life of caesar
where it says keep your friends close
but your enemies closer
the problem is often the solution
in a different set of clothes
come on in
in this case we gave the drug dealers
the doormans uniform
now we didnt control the door or the drugs
you as weii iove come on
im sorry its not your scene tonight mate
come on
i pay your fucking wages mate
youre on a windup arent you
just fucking do one
according to william blake
the road of excess
leads to the palace of wisdom
i was on my way there in a jag
heiio
hiya
heiio are you aii right iad
kiss
theres some very
unspectacuiar fiowers and grapes
nice views
beautifui
troiis
i used to have troiis when i was iittie

martin hannett too big for death
the hope of resurrection
in those whose bodies are subject to decay
wed been running on empty for months

nathan
there was no heroin on the island
but there was plenty of crack
every week we sent over
all the cash we had to pay for the studio
and nathan used it for drugs instead
when the cash ran out
they stole the recording gear
then they stole the furniture
and then they sold their clothes
i was stranded on a desert island
with no shelter nor companionship
every day i kept watch for rescue
but no one came

then i wouid not be seiiing him on for a fee
im gonna make you an offer
can i iean on this
yes youve gotta be a bit its fine
im gonna make you an offer
for the whoie company
okay
pou5000000
what do you want for that
what do i want
i want everything
i want everything i want the back cataiogue
i want this tabie this food these windows
i want it aii
you want factory
quite right
okay right were very fiattered
terribiy fiattered
that you think were worth such a princeiy sum
however what i have to expiain to you is that
factory records are not actuaiiy a company
we are an experiment in human nature
youre iaboring under the misapprehension
that we actuaiiy have
a deai
with our bands
that we have any kind of a contract at aii
and im afraid we dont
because thats the sum totai of the paperwork
to do with factory records deai
with their various bands
the artists own aii their own work
the iabei owns nothing
our bands have the freedom
to fuck off
quite right
the freedom to fuck off
i dont have to deai with you at aii
correct but my epitaph wiii be
that i
never iiteraiiy nor metaphoricaiiy
soid out
i protected myseif from ever having to have
the diiemma of having to seii out
by having nothing to seii out
youre fucking mad
thats a point of view
most of all i love manchester
the crumbling warehouses the railway arches
the cheap abundant drugs
thats what did it in the end
not the money not the music
not even the guns
that is my heroic flaw
my excess of civic pride
ryan
tony wiison is it true
the hacienda is ciosing down
yes it is
how does it feei

giorious the hacienda is dead

ciock
cock or ciock it doesnt matter
whose seed is catching the wind

dozens thousands of iittie baby dandeiions
like the biggest ever fuck
and now she wants one so ive gotta go
ive got the horn ryan
