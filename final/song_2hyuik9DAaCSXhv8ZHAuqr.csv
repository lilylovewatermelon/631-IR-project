id like to say it was perfect
growing up was a fairytale
but hollywood dont make no movies
about a house up on wheels down a dirt road mississippi
tucked back in the trees
route 3 box 250 d

verse 1
well the man my mama married
had a mean streak in his blood
and when he took to drinking
hed take it out on us
and i could hear my mama crying
that made it hard to sleep
route 3 box 250 d

bridge 1
thats where i became a man
long before my time
and since i left i aint been back
but i go back in my mind

verse 2
thank god for buford bailey
he had a pond hed let me fish
thats where id run off to
every chance id get
and i would pray that god was listening
and hed come rescue me

then one day my uncle pulled up in a pickup truck
loaded up everything

chorus 2
id like to say it was perfect
that growing up was a fairytale
but hollywood dont make no movies
about a house up on wheels down a dirt road mississippi
