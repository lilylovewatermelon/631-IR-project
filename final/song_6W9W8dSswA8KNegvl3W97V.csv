i walk in on friday nights
same old bar same burned out lights
same people and all the same faces
so why in the hell does it feel like a different place

verse 2 cassadee pope
meet my friends for a girls night out
seems there aint much to talk about
same drinks that were all raising
but all of the toasts just dont feel the same

chorus chris young  cassadee pope
we used to be the life of the party
we used to be the ones that they wished they were
but now its like they dont know how to act
maybe theyre like me and they want us back
its like theres always an empty space
those memories that nobody can erase
of how bright we burned
well now it hurts but its true
when they think of me they think of you

verse 3 chris young  cassadee pope
they keep asking how i am
but theyre really asking where youve been
i can read between all of the lines
it aint just us missing all of the times

we were the life of the party
we used to be the ones that they wished they were
but now its like they dont know how to act
maybe theyre like me and they want us back
its like theres always an empty space
those memories that nobody can erase
of how bright we burned
well now it hurts but its true
when they think of me they think of you

bridge chris young  cassadee pope
aint it funny how a flame like that
oh whoa when they think of you
it can burn when its in the past

chorus chris young  cassadee pope
we used to be the life of the party
we used to be the ones that they wished they were
but now its like they dont know how to act
maybe theyre like me and they want us back
its like theres always an empty space
those memories that nobody can erase
of how bright we burned
well now it hurts but its true
when they think of me they think of you
outro chris young  cassadee pope
oh they think of you
when they think of me
baby baby oh
when they think of me they think of you3embed"
