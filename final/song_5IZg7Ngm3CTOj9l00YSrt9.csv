alone im searching for devotion
in a faded melody
my soul is trying to cross an ocean
down on bended knee
lock up my cadence and rhyme
dont know what im trying to say
my heart all the time was stolen by bad poetry

chorus
some nights i talk to myself
i say the words that i could say to no one else
and some nights i talk in my sleep
i say the words i never said when you were with me
some nights i talk to myself
i say the words that i could say to no one else
and some nights i talk in my sleep
i say the words i never said when you were with me

verse 2
im gone the nightmares cut me open
loves insanity
so long words are left unspoken
i couldnt set them free
watch all the language run dry thoughts go on holiday
my heart im left with a broken vocabulary

some nights i talk to myself
i say the words that i could say to no one else
and some nights i talk in my sleep
i say the words i never said when you were with me

chorus
some nights i talk to myself
i say the words that i could say to no one else
and some nights i talk in my sleep
i say the words i never said when you were with me
some nights i talk to myself
i say the words that i could say to no one else
and some nights i talk in my sleep
i say the words i never said when you were with me4embed"
