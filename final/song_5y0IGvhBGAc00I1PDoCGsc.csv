its my foot its my heart its my back
that im willing to break

its the dog in me whos barking at you
what am i doing here everybody wants you
hands down pilgrim
your death is coming soon

chorus
i dont wanna move too fast
i dont wanna scare you off
i dont wanna move too slow
someones gonna snatch you up
i dont wanna move too slow
i dont wanna move too slow
and end up all alone

im like a house cat waiting to be declawed
its a shotgun wedding
i hate my inlaws
its a drag draggin them around town
its dragging me down

if i dont act soon somebodys gonna get you
i wouldnt mind i could never tie you down
you might also likechorus
i dont wanna move too fast
i dont wanna scare you off
i dont wanna move too slow
someones gonna snatch you up
i dont wanna move too slow
i dont wanna move too slow
and end up all alone

ive lost the plot
what was this all about
attack piano
the words are spilling out of my gun
black blood from your new high heels
stomping out someone who never should be lying at your feet

chorus
i dont wanna move too fast
i dont wanna scare you off
i dont wanna move too slow
someones gonna snatch you up
i dont wanna move too slow
i dont wanna move too slow
and end up all aloneembed"
