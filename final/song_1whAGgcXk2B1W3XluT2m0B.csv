dont cut out my paper heart
i aint dyin anyway
take a look at eiffel towers
never trust them dirty liars
sippin lemon yellow booze
old lead belly sings the blues
all dressed up on wedding day
keep on trippin anyway

chorus
i am i am i said im not myself
im not dead and im not for sale
so keep your bankroll lottery
eat your salad day deathbed motorcade

verse 2
fake the heat and scratch the itch
skinnedup knees and salty lips
ill breathe your life vicks vapor life
and when you binge i purge alike
let go its harder holdin on
one more trip and ill be gone
so keep your head up keep it on
just a whisper ill be gone
take a breath and make it big
its the last youll ever get
break your neck with diamond noose
its the last youll ever choose

im not dead and im not for sale

eat your salad day deathbed motorcade
