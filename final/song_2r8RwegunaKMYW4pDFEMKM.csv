i fell for your magic i tasted your skin
and though this is tragic at least i found the end
i witnessed your madness you shed light on my sins
and if we share in this sadness then where have you been

chorus
i know youre not in love like you used to be
guess i’m not the one like you used to think
so youll just run
i know that im stuck in this misery
guess i’m not enough like you used to think
so ill just run ooh

verse 2
you bathe in your victory
you blew out on my fuse
and if i took on the planet
will i pay my dues
your love was a mystery
yeah my love is a fool
and i traveled the country just to get to you

chorus
i know youre not in love like you used to be
guess im not the one like you used to think
so youll just run
i know that im stuck in this misery
guess im not enough like you used to think
so ill just run
you might also likeoutro
and i traveled the country
and i traveled the country just to get to you
i know you’re not in love
i know you’re not in love
i know youre not in love192embed"
