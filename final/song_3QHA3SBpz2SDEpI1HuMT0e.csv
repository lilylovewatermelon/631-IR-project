cant explain nor can i contain
control you have on my soul
cause all i do is baby dream of you
im fallin down when youre around

chorus
youre the only one youre the only one
im so wrapped up in a daze
hopin this is just a phase
but when all is said and done
i know you are still the one
youre the only one youre the only one
cupids bow it stung
now youre the only one

verse 2
mystery is what this is to me
im givin up im having no luck
like a ghost the one that i love most
she disappears when i get near

chorus
youre the only one youre the only one
im so wrapped up in a daze
hopin this is just a phase
but when all is said and done
i know you are still the one
youre the only one youre the only one
cupids bow it stung
now youre the only one
