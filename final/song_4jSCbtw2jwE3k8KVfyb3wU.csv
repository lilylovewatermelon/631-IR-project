we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while

verse 1
i had one mission but i committed treason
i cant believe i caved for you
so i am now a failure everything i gave you
lets elope and live like you
trapped inside each other we dont even bother
na√Øve say its a beautiful thing
hope we live forever doesnt sound too clever
works as my protective wing

chorus
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love til it dies
til it dies again
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love til it dies
til it dies again

postchorus
together we fall

i had one mission but i committed treason
i promise i would stay away
from you and your bad tricks you are my quick fix
i can feel it fade away
suddenly the day came we started to place blame
driving us right out of our heads
you say its my error i say look in the mirror
the reason why our flame is dead

chorus
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love til it dies
til it dies again
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while
we can run on love for a while
til it dies

outro
i always go back to you
i always go back
i always go back to you
i always go back
i always go back to you
i always go back
i always go back to you
together we fall5embed"
