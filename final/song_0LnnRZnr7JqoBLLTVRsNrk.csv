i aint got a lot of money
all i got is time and the reason to rhyme
dont need a lot of money
all i need is you
i aint got a lot of money
all i got is time and the reason to rhyme
dont need a lot of money
all i need is you

verse 1
my baby girl was a virgin till i came inside
with the brown eye passionate and kisses right
when i got her arms wrapped around my side
then you know its a feeling that youre talkin about
and if you dont need me then i dont need you on my mind
and if you dont want me then i dont want you on my dime

prechorus x2
i said im leavin baby
never look back never look back
i said im leavin honey
never look back again

chorus x2
i aint got a lot of money
all i got is time and a reason to rhyme
dont need a lot of money
all i need is you

chorus x2
