last night it was so real
i can still feel
you all over me
and i woke up reaching for you
wanting to hold you
damn everything felt right
last night

chorus
when you called me
said you want me
told me you were coming over
said youre running red lights
at 85 and getting closer
a kiss at the door ended up on the floor
aint too sure what hurts more
that you didnt or that i dreamed you did

verse 2
yeah we said everything we didnt say
without saying a word at all
i tried like hell to fall back asleep
just to see if maybe we
could pick back up where we left off

when you called me
said you want me
told me you were coming over
said youre running red lights
at 85 and getting closer
a kiss at the door ended up on the floor
aint too sure what hurts more
that you didnt or that i dreamed you did

bridge
is it worse that youre so gone
that i dont even cross your mind
or that ill be dreaming that youre coming back again tonight

chorus
when you called me
said you want me
told me you were coming over
said youre running red lights
at 85 and getting closer
a kiss at the door ended up on the floor
aint too sure what hurts more
that you didnt or that i dreamed you did

outro
i dreamed you did
yeah i dreamed you did
yeah i dreamed you didembed"
