verse 2
yeah you know i keep it real honest
real topics aint no way i will stop it
chills watching everything thats going on around me they wonder if i still got it
im still rhymin just another day in paradise phil collins
til you put your hands on me yeah now we got a real problem
pay homage make comments
we in the same genre but i can guarantee we dont put out the same product
get away from me there aint nothing you can say to me
tried to roll my name through the dirt thats fine i was made from it
you aint made it til they printin shirts with your face on it
outside tryna sell em at your shows those are fake dummy
this is something cant nobody ever take from me
no mistakin me take a blade to me take a vein from me
let me know what you get when you pull the dna from me woo
no matches ive been the baddest no way to match it
you never seen the passion thats even half this
im wreakin havoc
i think the fact that you think im average is kinda madness
so quit your naggin you couldnt fathom what ive imagined
forget the mansion im in the attic
its pretty graphic but had to happen
you wont see it get your glasses forget the status
prechorus 2
yeah i feel like we might be on the comeup all day
knew i was a problem how i showed up ayy
did not have to sell out but the show does all day
they ask me why i do it so i told em yeah
