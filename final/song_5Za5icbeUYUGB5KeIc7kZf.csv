oh yeah
fuck it
yeah

verse 1
ooh i got a killers blood
burning deep inside my veins down in my veins
dont expect you to understand
i was born without a name no name
i see right through you
your opinions are a fuckin joke laughing
i crucify you
on a silver spoon i hope you choke

chorus
im tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
this time im doing it for me and me alone
i dont need anyone dont think i ever did
not trying to be selfish just doing what i know
im a menace
right

verse 2
ooh ill fade the fuck away
swear to god that i dont care i swear to christ
ill die a lonely death
cause i know that life aint fair it aint fair at all
i cant pretend that i am
someone that im not
i live for me myself
you cant convince me that im wrong
