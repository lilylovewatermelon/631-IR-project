god i thought i loved you so
god i thought i loved you so

verse 1 kid cudi
they done let in the skinny jeanwearing
frofordays in a old aa
ball so low most fools couldnt price me
silently stunt with a blunt full of pe
and i guess you know me
been in ny so long got tristate family
especially brooklyn—shoutout to the madis
my bloodline runs deep
nights i don’t sleep
figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
these motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
slowmobrain assbackwards cowards
take a shower your attitude stinks
wanna know what i think

you might also likeverse 2 kid cudi
i live through words not metaphors
so i passed to be the rest of the freshmen
playful tough talk often the fave
til i came like pac art and said true things
a whole new legion of some niggas
aiming high past the idea of slanging
praise allah for keeping me away man
lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
some things will never be the same
wish that i could tell my brother
something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
he’s leaving behind a family and a mother
damn you must understand
what i speak about in song this how i really am
yeah this is how i really think
you can see what i see yes i really blink
yes i really drink i really do rage
my demons out the cage bout most of the day
before i became the age to even rage
i was drowning my sorrows with some oe nigga
