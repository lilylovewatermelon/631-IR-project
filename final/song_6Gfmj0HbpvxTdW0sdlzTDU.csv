i hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
and each road leads you where you wanna go
and if youre faced with a choice and you have to choose
i hope you choose the one that means the most to you
and if one door opens to another door closed
i hope you keep on walkin till you find the window
if its cold outside show the world the warmth of your smile
but more than anything more than anything

chorus
my wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
your dreams stay big your worries stay small
you never need to carry more than you can hold
and while youre out there getting where youre getting to
i hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too
yeah this is my wish

verse 2
i hope you never look back but you never forget
all the ones who love you and the place you left
i hope you always forgive and you never regret
and you help somebody every chance you get
oh youd find gods grace in every mistake
and always give more than you take
but more than anything yeah more than anything
