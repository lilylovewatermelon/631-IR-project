emerging from my world
imagine living in a box
and i wont come out
until ive broken all the locks
slurring all my words
until something sticks
but in this smoky universe
my mind keeps playing tricks

chorus
and although youre the only home i know
as if by magic thoughts of you are gone
and now im keeping my head in the clouds
and its not so tragic if i dont look down

postchorus
ooooooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooooh ooooh
ooooooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooooh ooooh

verse 2
submerging from your world
and back into my bliss
a day rolled into one
is burning on my lips
blurring all your words
until they dont exist
and in a parallel universe
its me you cant resist

and although youre the only home ill ever know
as if by magic thoughts of you are gone
and now im keeping my head in the clouds
and its not so tragic if i dont look down

postchorus
ooooooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooooh ooooh
ooooooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooooh ooooh

chorus
and although you say im a rosetinted lover come on
youre the only home ill ever know you know ill never love another
as if by magic i wont stay a lonely lover for long
thoughts of you are gone
and now you say im a rosetinted lover come on
im keeping my head in the clouds you know ill never love another
and its not so tragic i wont stay a lonely lover for long
if i dont look down3embed"
