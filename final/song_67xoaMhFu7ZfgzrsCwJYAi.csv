long hours and a few dyin flowers
but you never seem to stick around
how could you let somethin so good
go to waste and bleed the colours out

prechorus
you dont know what you got till its gone
know when its right till its wrong
in search of perfect when you had it with you all along
you broke her heart down with ease
now im pickin up every piece
you must be so hard to please

chorus
i wish i could say
thank you for all the mistakes
thank you for all of the pain
i guess somebody elses loss is anothers gain
im sayin thank you to the one who let her get away
away

verse 2
she gave you love but it wasnt enough
you had your mind set out on other things
cant sleep at night now youre payin the price
you let another come and take your place

you dont know what you got till its gone
know when its right till its wrong
in search of perfect when you had it with you all along
you broke her heart down with ease
now im pickin up every piece
you must be so hard to please

chorus
i wish i could say
thank you for all the mistakes
thank you for all of the pain
