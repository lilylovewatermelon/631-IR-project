it really sucks to give your heart to a girl
you wanna know her like she knows the whole world
but 10 seconds and its obvious its goin nowhere
she makes you tell her that shes your best friend
you tell her things you know wont make her mad
dont want to be the one to say things are goin nowhere

chorus
where are you now
oh oh oh
where are you now
oh oh oh
i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna wait by the phone
and i dont wanna tell you i love you
dont wanna tell you i love you anymore

verse 2
its hard to live outside a safety zone
cause you remember bein all alone
two kinds of misery and either way
youre going nowhere

chorus
where are you now
oh oh oh
where are you now
oh oh oh
i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna wait by the phone
and i dont wanna tell you i love you
dont wanna tell you i love you anymore
dont wanna tell you i love you
dont wanna tell you i love you anymore
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
and she makes me want to be a homosexual
maybe ill be your best friend
maybe see ya naked once in a while

outro
i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna talk
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna wait by the phone
and i dont wanna tell you i love you
dont wanna tell you i love you anymore
dont wanna tell you i love you
dont wanna tell you i love you anymore
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna rock
i dont wanna tell you i love you anymoreembed"
