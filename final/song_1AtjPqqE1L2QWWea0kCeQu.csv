nothing i ever did was good enough for you
nothing i ever did could ever seem to please you
you always tried to make me feel small
and all i did was give you my all
never felt pretty enough
never felt sexy enough
never felt good enough
you tried to keep me down on my knees
i got myself back up on my feet
found the strength to set myself free

chorus
and i feel beautiful beautiful
i feel beautiful beautiful
you could not crush my soul
crush my soul
nothing you can do to me
could take away my right to feel
beautiful beautiful
i was down so low down so low
but i wont be
wont be brought down anymore
i stand with my head held high
i feel beautiful
see fantasia liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeverse 2
use to make me feel like i did nothing right
use to make me feel like i meant nothing in your life
always gave all i had to you
all i wanted was for you too
see me as pretty enough
see me as sexy enough
see me as good enough
but all i did was waste all my time
i woke up and open my eyes
finally took back hold of my life

chorus
and now i feel beautiful beautiful
i feel beautiful beautiful
you could not crush my soul
crush my soul
nothing you can do to me
could take away my right to feel
beautiful beautiful
i was down so low down so low
but i wont be
wont be brought down anymore
i stand with my head held high
i feel beautiful
bridge
you tried to make me feel worthless
now i know im not
my worth is priceless
i got back my pride
i took back my life

chorus
and i feel beautiful beautiful
i feel beautiful beautiful
you could not crush my soul
crush my soul
nothing you can do to me
could take away my right to feel
beautiful beautiful
i was down so low down so low
but i wont be
wont be brought down anymore
i stand with my head held high
i feel beautiful
i feel beautiful
nothing you can say to me because i feel
beautifulembed"
