if i was jesus id have some real long hair
a robe and some sandals is exactly what id wear
id be the guy at the party turning water to wine
yeah me and my disciples wed have a real good time

chorus
ooh and id lay my life down for you whoa
and i show you whos the boss whoa
id forgive you and adore you
while i was hanging on your cross

verse 2
if i was jesus
id have some friends that were poor
id run around with the wrong crowd man id never be bored
then id heal me a blind man get myself crucified
by politicians and preachers who got something to hide

chorus
ooh and id lay my life down for you whoa
and i show you whos the boss whoa
id forgive you and adore you
while i was hanging on your cross

verse 3
if i was jesus id come back from the dead
and id walk on some water just to mess with your head
i know your dark little secrets id look you right in the face
and id tell you i love you with amazing grace
