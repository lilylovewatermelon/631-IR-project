in the car i just cant wait
to pick you up on our very first date
is it cool if i hold your hand
is it wrong if i think its lame to dance
do you like my stupid hair
would you guess that i didnt know what to wear
im just scared of what you think
you make me nervous so i really cant eat

chorus
lets go dont wait
this nights almost over
honest lets make
this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever

verse 2
when you smile i melt inside
im not worthy for a minute of your time
i really wish it was only me and you
im jealous of everybody in the room
please dont look at me with those eyes
please dont hint that youre capable of lies
i dread the thought of our very first kiss
a target that im probably gonna miss

lets go dont wait
this nights almost over
honest lets make
this night last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
forever and ever
lets make this last forever
