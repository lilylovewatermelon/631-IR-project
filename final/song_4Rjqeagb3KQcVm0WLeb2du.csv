as far as all my friends can tell
i took her leaving well  thats kind of right
cause when im out with them
i dont let her memory rule the night
for the most part im okay
but i still miss her in a roundabout way

chorus
around about the time that midnight rolls around
thats around about the time my tears start falling down
cause shes not around
i come unwound and my heart breaks
yeah i still miss her in a round about way

verse 2
i no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
wishing she would call
and just the other day
i took her smiling face down off my wall
ive come a long long way
but i still miss her in a round about way

chorus
around about the time that midnight rolls around
thats around about the time my tears start falling down
cause shes not around
i come unwound and my heart breaks
yeah i still miss her in a round about way
