in time youll learn this is about you
in time youll learn this is about you
in time youll learn this is about you

verse kendrick lamar
babies from 80s dont know know no better
dont nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with
some of them masculine some of them feminine
member the universe used to be innocent
now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
every day that i wake up ima sin again
im not a citizen im just a nigga from section80

outro
show of hands how many been taking notes
good
leave everything on the table now
vulnerability
this is your generation
show show your painsee kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also like14embed"
