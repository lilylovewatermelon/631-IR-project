walk through them double doors
order up a double crown
saw an angel lookin at me so i sat down
talk for a couple songs
heartbreaks and home towns
slid a little closer thinkin i would come around
had to tell her baby it aint you
i just got somethin i gotta do

chorus
tonight i just want a whiskey
to sit here alone
flip through the pictures of the memories on my phone
and juke box with me until the lights come on
you look so right but girl it feels so wrong
i thought i could show up get drunk get this heartbreak on
but tonight i need a raincheck on movin on
mmm hmm

verse 2
she said boy thats okay
ive seen that look before
aint ever easy when you watch em walk out the door
so i bought her a round
said have a good night
maybe ill be good next time

tonight i just want a whiskey
to sit here alone
flip through the pictures of the memories on my phone
and juke box with me until the lights come on
you look so right but girl it feels so wrong
i thought i could show up get drunk get this heartbreak on
but tonight i need a raincheck on movin on
mmm hmm

bridge
yeah tonight i need a raincheck on movin on
lettin go gettin close
maybe tomorrow i dont know

chorus
tonight i just want a whiskey
to sit here alone
flip through the pictures of the memories on my phone
and juke box with me until the lights come on
you look so right but girl it feels so wrong
i thought i could show up get drunk get this heartbreak on
but tonight i need a raincheck on movin on
yeah tonight i need a raincheck on movin onembed"
