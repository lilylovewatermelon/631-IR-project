wish i could say i could say ive been looking for you my whole life
but i never believed i never dreamed i never knew anything could feel this right
i got a past i couldnt get past but it dont haunt me any more
because all my demons they ran like hell when my angel walked through my door

chorus
you were always the only one
you were always the only one
yeah

verse 2
if i had a chance a chance to take it all back god knows i would
hide your heart away hide you from the pain every second if i could
well baby no matter what happens now you can know im always yours
i aint ever going nowhere because i aint never loved no loved nobody more

chorus

verse 3
if you never believe anything else i ever say
every second every moment every day every day
if you never believe anything else i ever say
every second every moment in every way
