it will never be gone
my good side and bad don’t need no chaperone
i’m living city pretty new orleans
with my hood good girl
she’s my honeybee
and she never ever lies to me
but she sure knows how to lie with me
i caught a cold case of love from the past
now i’m here to shake the funk out your ass

are you happy with the plans you’re making
are you satisfied with who you are
now its on cuz the karma’s free
if you want to role the dice and play the cards with me
you better jump in line baby while the bets are free
cuz ain’t no pretty girl ever changing me
i’ve got a coked out neighbor
i’m losing my gas
and all i ever have to do is pass the test
c’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon

we’ve got the feeling in our bones
we’re all just one big family now
we’ve got the feeling in our bones
we’re all just one big family now
all in the family now

we’re keeping it moving baby
we’re keeping it moving

keeping it moving
keeping it moving
keeping it moving
keeping it moving baby

are you happy with the plans you’re making
are you satisfied with who you are
did you create your world around you
or did you let them drive your feelings far

are you happy with the plans you’re making
are you satisfied with who you are
did you create your world around you
or did you let them drive your feelings far

are you happy with the plans you’re making
are you satisfied with who you are
