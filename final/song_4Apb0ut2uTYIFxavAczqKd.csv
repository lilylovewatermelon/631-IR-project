here we go welcome to my funeral
without you i dont even have a pulse
all alone its dark and cold
with every move i die
here i go this is my confessional
a lost cause nobody can save my soul
i am so delusional
with every move i die

prechorus
i have destroyed our love its gone
payback is sick
its all my fault

chorus
im dancing with tears in my eyes
just fighting to get through the night
im losin it losin it losin it losin it
with every move i die
im faded im broken inside
ive wasted the love of my life
im losin it losin it losin it losin it
with every move i die

verse 2
when did i become such a hypocrite
double life lies that you caught me in
trust me im paying for it
with every move i die
on the floor im just a zombie
who i am is not who i wanna be
im such a tragedy
with every move i die
