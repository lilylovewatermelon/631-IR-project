i can feel a chill of a cold november wind
here in oklahoma that means it is wintertime again
every time i think about the rain and sleet and snow
i start dreaming about siestas underneath this sombrero

chorus
baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to mexico
get a place in cabo kick back in the sand
it’ll be just you and me and moonlight dancing on the sea
to spanish guitar melody of a mariachi band

verse 2
i got two tickets bought
there won’t be no second thought
weather’s always nice down there in paradise
we’ll find that little man who owns that taco stand
we’ll be drinking margaritas while we’re working on our tan

chorus
baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to mexico
get a place in cabo kick back in the sand
if you’ll get off that telephone and put your shorts and sandals on
tomorrow we’ll be dancing to a mariachi band

bridge
cancun don’t get me high
that’s where the snow birds fly
they like to winter there
then they come from everywhere
i’ll take the baja sun
it ain’t overrun
with the gringos and the touristas
we might be the only ones
you might also likechorus
baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to mexico
get a place in cabo kick back in the sand
if you’ll get off that telephone and put your shorts and sandals on
tomorrow we’ll be dancing to a mariachi band

baby if you’re good to go we’ll go down to mexico
get a place in cabo kick back in the sand
if you’ll get off that telephone and put your shorts and sandals on
tomorrow we’ll be dancing to a mariachi bandembed"
