well i spend all day sittin in the shade
waitin in my pickup truck
in not too long a law man drives by
he stops to see whats up
so i had to pull on over and give my eyes a break
youre a busy man nothin to see here
so i send him on his way
i see his taillights fadin and i grab my glass of tea
truth is my names roy johnson
coyote is my trade

verse 2
not five minutes later
a mesquite bush starts shakin like it was afraid
fifteen men women and children
jumped in the back of my chevrolet
saw them tremblin in my rearview mirror
through my aviator shades
said me llamo roy johnson
and coyote is my trade

chorus
cause you wont hear me comin
and you wont see my face
i cut that trail a thousand times
all without a trace
its my line of business
no it aint a pretty thing
my name is roy johnson
coyote is my trade

chorus
no you wont hear me comin
and you wont see my face
well i cut that trail a thousand times

verse 3
well i clearly remember
like it was yesterday
i had that chevy parked right under
my usual spot of shade
not five minutes later
a mesquite bush started shakin like it was afraid
fifteen federale jumped out
and they all knew my name
chorus
i guess they saw me comin
they saw my face
and i cut that trail a thousand times
guess i left a trace
its my line of business
and i aint ashamed to say
my name is roy johnson
coyote is my trade
hey hey

now i spend all day sittin in the shade
waitin in my pickup truckembed"
