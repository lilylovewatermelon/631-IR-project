going very far
down the street in my car

driving driving in my car
feeling like a star
bouncing down the street in my car

driving driving in my car
turn the handlebar
speeding down the street in my car

bouncing on a bumpy road
stopping for a hopping toad
going to my favorite park
hurry before it gets dark
in my car
in my car

driving driving in my car
going very far
down the street in my car

driving driving in my car
feeling like a star
bouncing down the street in my car
you might also likedriving driving in my car
turn the handlebar
speeding down the street in my car

hooting tooting on the horn
driving round from dusk till dawn
going near and going far
iâ€™m a superstar
in my car
in my car

driving in my car
driving in my car
driving in my car
