hey dad im writing to you
not to tell you that i still hate you
just to ask you how you feel
and how we fell apart how this fell apart

verse 1
are you happy out there in this great wide world
do you think about your sons do you miss your little girl
when you lay your head down how do you sleep at night
do you even wonder if were alright

prechorus
if were alright
were alright

chorus
its been a long hard road without you by my side
why werent you there all the nights that we cried
you broke my mothers heart you broke your children for life
its not okay but were alright
i remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
but those are just a long lost memory of mine
i spent so many years learning how to survive
now im writing just to let you know im still alive
