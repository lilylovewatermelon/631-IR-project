fun times in babylon
thats what im counting on
before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
before the new wing of the prison ribbon ceremony
before the star of the morning comes looking for me

chorus
i would like to abuse my lungs
smoke everything in sight with every girl ive ever loved
ride around the wreckage on a horse kneedeep in blood
look out hollywood here i come

verse 2
fun times in babylon
mama theyve just begun
before they put me to work in a government camp
before they do my face up like a corpse and say get up and dance
before the beast comes looking for last years rent

chorus
i would like to abuse my lungs
smoke everything in sight with every girl ive ever loved
ride around my wreckage on a horse kneedeep in blood
look out hollywood here i come
