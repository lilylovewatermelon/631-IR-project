walking in my sleep
like the naked trees
will they wake up again
do they sleep do they dream
feel it as the wind strokes my skin
i am moved by the chill
hear the winter bird sing

prechorus
ahahahahahahahah
ahahahahahahah

chorus
my tears are always frozen
i can see the air i breathe
got my fingers painting pictures
on the glass in front of me
lay me by the frozen river
where the boats have passed me by
all i need is to remember
how it was to feel alive

verse 2
silent days violent shades
we are dancing again
in a dream by the lake
