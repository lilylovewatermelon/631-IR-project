sexy sexy made up of plexi disasters
pushing and pulling conservative rolling
unlike plastic easier to see through
just like glass with no ring
softer and sadder you sing
sexy sexy do your thing
learn to be shy and then you can sting
plexi plexi bend dont shatter
once youre broken shape wont matter

chorus
youre breaking your mind
by killing the time that kills you
but you cant blame the time
cause its only in your mind

verse 2
quickly quickly grow and then youll know
it is such an awkward show to see
and everyone you wanted to know
and everyone you wanted to meet
have all
gone away
well theyve all
gone away and

youre breaking your mind
by killing the time that kills you
but you cant blame the time
cause its only in your mind

outro
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
youre breaking your mind
