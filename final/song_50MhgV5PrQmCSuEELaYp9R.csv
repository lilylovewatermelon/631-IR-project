the world is changing
the planets heating up
what the fuck is going on recorded laughter
rearranging
its like everything happened all at once
um what the fuck is going on recorded laughter
the people rising in the streets
the war the drought
the more i look the more i see nothing to joke about
is comedy over
should i leave you alone
cause really whos gonna go for joking at a time like this
should i be joking at a time like this

prechorus bo burnham
i wanna help to leave this world better than i found it
and i fear that comedy wont help and the fear is not unfounded
should i stop trying to be funny
should i give away my money no
what do i do
chorus bo burnham  ethereal voice
healing the world with comedy
the indescribable power of your comedy
the world needs direction
from a white guy like me bingo
who is healing the world with comedy
thats it

the world is so fucked up systematic oppression income inequality the other stuff
and theres only one thing that i can do about it while— while being paid and being the center of attention

chorus bo burnham
healing the world with comedy
making a literal difference metaphorically
a jew walks into a bar and ive saved him a seat
thats healing the world with comedy

verse 2 bo burnham
im a special kind of white guy
i selfreflected and i want to be an agent of change
so i am gonna use my privilege for the good
very cool way to go
american white guys
weve had the floor for at least fourhundred years
so maybe i should just shut the fuck up

refrain
im bored

verse 3
i dont wanna do that
theres got to be another way yes
for me to help out without standing on the sidelines never
the wait is over
im white and im here to save the day
lord help me channel sandra bullock in the blind side sandra bullock
chorus bo burnham
healing the world with comedy
making a literal difference metaphorically
and yes most likely theyll pay me but id do it for free
i am healing the world with comedy

bridge bo burnham
if you wake up in a house thats full of smoke
dont panic
call me and ill tell you a joke
if you see white men dressed in white cloaks
dont panic—call me and ill tell you a joke
oh shit
should i be joking at a time like this
if you start to smell burning toast
youre having a stroke
or overcooking your toast
if you wake up in a house thats full of smoke
dont panic—call me and ill tell you a joke
if you see white men dressed in white cloaks
dont panic—call me and ill tell you a joke
oh shit
should i be joking at a time like this
somebody help me out cause i dont know

prechorus bo burnham
and i want to help to leave this world better than i found it
and i fear that comedy wont help and the fear is not unfounded
should i stop trying to be funny
should i give away my money no
i know what i gotta do
chorus bo burnham
healing the world with comedy
making a literal difference metaphorically
i swore id never be back and now im back on my feet
and im healing the world with comedy8embed"
