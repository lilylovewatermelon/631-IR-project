we walk in your footsteps
though ive had my ups and downs
and ill stand in the silence
until i figure it out

chorus 1
one might fall and the other will stand
and one might give where the other wont bend
the night is bright as the sun

chorus 2
im never going to know
never going to  look back
never going to know where we would have ended up at
the end has only begun

verse 2
so stop counting the hours
live out in the world
cause ive been chasing the answers
and they dont want to be found

well the day
tonight feels like a million miles away

what you do
no one can decide its up to you
and who you are is what you choose
these times when the world falls apart
make us who we areembed"
