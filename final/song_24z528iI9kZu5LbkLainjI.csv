theres no money theres no possessions only obsession
i dont need that shit
take my money take my obsession

verse 1
i just want to be heard
loud and clear are my words
coming from within man
tell them what you heard
its about a revolution
in your heart and in your mind
you can find the conclusion
lifestyle and obsession
diamond rings get you nothin
but a lifelong lesson
and your pocketbook stressin
youre a slave to the system
working jobs that you hate
for that shit you dont need
its too bad the world is based on greed
step back and see
stop thinking about yourself
start thinking about

chorus
theres no money theres no possessions only obsession
i dont need that shit
take my money take my possessions take my obsession
i dont need that shit

because everything is nothing and emptiness is in everything
this reality is really just a fucked up dream
with the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
flip it inside out its a big black hole
take your money burn it up like an asteroid
possessions they are never going to fill the void
take it away and learn the best lesson
the heart the soul the life the passion

chorus
theres no money theres no possessions only obsession
i dont need that shit
take my money take my possessions take my obsession
i dont need that shit

money possessions obsession

bridge
present yourself press your clothes
comb your hair clock in
you just cant win just cant win
the things you own own you no
take my money take my possessions take my obsession
i dont need that shit
fuck your money fuck your possessions fuck your obsession
i dont need that shit
outro
money possession obsession
i dont need that shit8embed"
