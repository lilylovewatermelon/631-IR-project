hurtful words from my enemies of the last five years
whats it like to die alone
and how does it feel when tears freeze when you cry
the blood in your veins is twenty below

chorus
sitting in this room playing russian roulette
finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
out from the window see her backdrop silhouette
this blood on my hands is something i cannot forget
sitting in this room playing russian roulette
finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
out from the window see her backdrop silhouette
this blood on my hands is something i cannot forget
something i cannot forget

verse 2
so for now take this down a notch
crash my car through your window
make sure youre still alive
just in time to kill you

chorus
sitting in this room playing russian roulette
finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
out from the window see her backdrop silhouette
this blood on my hands is something i cannot forget
sitting in this room playing russian roulette
finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
out from the window see her backdrop silhouette
this blood on my hands is something i cannot forget
something i cannot forget
