inflatable pool full of dads hot air
i was three years old
splashing everywhere
and so began my love affair
with water

on a river bank
with all my friends
a big old rope tied to a limb
and you’re a big old wuss
if you dont jump in
the water

chorus
yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
and you dont know what to do
grab your swimming trunks
ice up that old igloo
drive until the map turns blue

verse 2
daytona beach on spring break
eighteen girls up on stage
white tshirts about to be sprayed
with water
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeoh let her go boys

chorus
yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
and you dont know what to do
just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
and drive until the map turns blue

verse 3
you can stay right there
when the daylights gone
play truth or dare
and it won’t take long
fore you and her got nothing on
but water

all you really need this time of year
is a pair of shades
and ice cold beer
and a place to sit somewhere near
waterembed"
