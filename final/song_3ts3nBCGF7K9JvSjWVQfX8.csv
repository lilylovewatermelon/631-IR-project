cant you see im no good without you

take my lips i want to lose them
take my arms ill never use them

your goodbyes they left me with eyes that cry
how can i get along without you

you took the part that once was my heart
so why not why not take all of me

lets go boys

your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
now im lost without you

and now that you took that part
that used to be my heart

all of me
why not take all of me

cant you see im a mess without you

you took the part that used to be my heart
so why not take all of meyou might also likeembed"
