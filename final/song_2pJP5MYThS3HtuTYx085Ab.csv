this aint a threat but i think i better warn ya
gonna fall in love if you go to california
i did and this is how i know

verse 1
by the beach north of san jose
met the right girl and it sounds cliche but
we decided not to take it slow
i said why wait youre my soulmate
took her by the hand in the golden state
now that youre mine things are gonna be fine
first came love then a baby carriage
hardly knew the people at my own damn marriage
but an open bar can open your mind

chorus
you save my life with every word you say
you shine your light for me to find the way
just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
here with me born to be
every part of you in half moon bay

verse 2
up in tiburon where the girls are warm
we stay inside while the rain clouds form
and thank god for rainy days like these
and just when the time has come to retire
baby starts crying so we dance by the fire
always does the trick you better believe
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likechorus
you save my life with every word you say
you shine your light for me to find the way
just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
here with me born to be
every part of you

bridge
why go slow if its nice and steady
we all know its in the stars already
ohoh ohoh
why say no if yes feels right
you just got to go where it feels like home

breakdown
this aint a threat but i think i better warn ya
gonna fall in love if you go to california
i did and this is how i know

chorus
you save my life with every word you say
you shine your light for me to find the way
just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
here with me born to be
every part of you
chorus 2
you save my life with every word you say
you shine your light so i can find my way
just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
here with me born to be
every part of you in half moon bay
