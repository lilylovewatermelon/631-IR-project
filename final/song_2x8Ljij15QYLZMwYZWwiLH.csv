lying there with a halo in her hair she cried
there are feathers everywhere but its fine
you do this all the time
crying now through a rusted smile she knows
this isnt how he paid the bills before
drug farm entrepreneur

prechorus
go spin circles for me
wound relentlessly around the words we used to sling
oh such torturous things
always chewing up the only ones i ever mean

chorus
if youre going then go
go go go
if youre going then go
go go go

verse 2
watch love get strangled by a kites cold strings
fall comes early and summer leaves
as a storm with the car keys
spark your heels up against the picket fence i built
all your wishes they will sink like stones
slowly down a lonely well

go spin circles for me
wound relentlessly around the words we used to sling
oh such torturous things
always chewing up the only ones i ever mean

chorus
if youre going then go
go go go
if youre going then go
go go go12embed"
