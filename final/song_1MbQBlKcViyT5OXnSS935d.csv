lets leave town on a permanent vacation
lock up the house pack up the station wagon
make paradise our final destination
as long as were out of here
there isnt no time like the present they say
lets cruise all the way down a1a
put the top down and catch a few rays
baby well be out of here

chorus
any where you want to go
as long as its sunny weather
let the time fly by i dont mind
as long as were together

bridge
south of the border theres a place i know
where james taylor sang about mexico
and the suns so hot well forget to go home
baby well be out of here

chorus
any where you want to go
as long as its sunny weather
let the time fly by i dont mind
as long as were together
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 2
baby drive through the county down to the lake
see if the catfish are jumping set out bait
and if we come up dry well just sleep in late
at least well be out of here
as long as were out of here
baby lets get out of here
out of here

outro
come on baby lets get out of here
cruise down a1a
hang out in key west a little whileembed"
