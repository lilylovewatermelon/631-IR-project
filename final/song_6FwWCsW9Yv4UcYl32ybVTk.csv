simple and small
almost alone
curled up in a ball
with a tin can phone
tied to a twist
leading outside
and into the mist
where the shadows hide
maybe when youre gone maybe when youre gone
well gladly take your place
youre so nicely drawn youre so nicely drawn
we like your face and

chorus
we wanna be your imaginary friend
wanna be your imaginary friend

verse 2
when you were young
you knew us well
the cat had your tongue
so you could not yell
when you were cross
all you could do
was call it a loss
though this was not true
weve since disappeared
that is until tonight
when you turn out the light
and everything stands still
the winds direction shifts
and makes the curtains lift
and you see us on the sill
you might also likebridge
every word that youve learned
every wish that youve burned
every single strand of hair in your head
every book that youve read
we love you this much

chorus
we wanna be your imaginary friend
wanna be your imaginary
