maybe im wrong or maybe im right
maybe its just too late but this is keeping me awake all night
maybe say yes or maybe say no
maybe im just too shy to admit that it is time to go

chorus
we go out on our own its a big bad world outside
carrying our dreams and all that they mean
trying to make it all worthwhile

verse 2
maybe believe or maybe dont care
shit maybe there is no god in the big white clouds up there
maybe live long or maybe die young
or maybe live every day like its your last day under the sun

chorus
we go out on our own its a big bad world outside
carrying our dreams and all that they mean
trying to make it all worthwhile
we go out on our own its a big bad world outside
carrying our dreams and all that they mean
try to make it all feel right
