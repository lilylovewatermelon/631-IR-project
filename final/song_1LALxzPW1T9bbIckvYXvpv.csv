one more night with the same neon lights
and ill find my place at the bar
one more dance so ill buy one more round
and ill try to drown out my heart

verse 2
hell walk in and make every head turn
and hell always be dressed to kill
day i left is my only regret
and now its become his biggest thrill

chorus
all my friendsll say hey dont you know him
and ill try to play it off cool
when they ask ill just say hes nobody
and me well im nobodys fool

verse 3
wont take long and hell find him someone
and then pull them out for a dance
every note tells me thats all she wrote
and reminds me how i missed my chance

verse 4
when hes done hell have a little more fun
and hell let her act like shes smooth
as they walk out while im learning about
what it is to have nothing to lose
