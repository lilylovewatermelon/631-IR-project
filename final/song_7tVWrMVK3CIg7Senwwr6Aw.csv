the singer finished singing and shes walking out
the singer sheds a tear fear of falling out

prechorus
and its hard to say how i feel today
for years gone by
and i cried

chorus
its hard to say that i was wrong
its hard to say i miss you
since youve been gone its not the same

verse 2
my worries weigh the world how i used to be
and everything im cold seems a plague in me

prechorus
and its hard to say how i feel today
for years gone by
and i cried

chorus
its hard to say that i was wrong
its hard to say i miss you
since youve been gone its not the same
its hard to say i held my tongue
its hard to say if only
since youve been gone its not the same
you might also likebridge
worse than the fear its the lie you told a thousand times before
worse than a fear its the knife

prechorus
and its hard to say how i feel today
for years gone by
and i cried

chorus
its hard to say that i was wrong
its hard to say i miss you
since youve been gone its not the same
its hard to say i held my tongue
its hard to say if only
since youve been gone im not the same

outro
its hard to say that i was wrong god its hard to say
its hard to say i miss you its hard to actually say
since youve been gone im not the sameembed"
