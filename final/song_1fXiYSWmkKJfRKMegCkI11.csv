well i came home
like a stone
and i fell heavy into your arms
these days of dust
which weve known
will blow away with this new sun

prechorus
but ill kneel down
wait for now
and ill kneel down
know my ground
chorus
and i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you

verse 2
so break my step
and relent
well you forgave and i wont forget
know what weve seen
and him with less
now in some way shake the excess
you might also likechorus
cause i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you

verse 3
now ill be bold
as well as strong
and use my head alongside my heart
so tame my flesh
and fix my eyes
a tethered mind freed from the lies

prechorus
and ill kneel down
wait for now
ill kneel down
know my ground
woo

bridge
raise my hands
paint my spirit gold
and bow my head
keep my heart slow
chorus
cause i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you
and i will wait i will wait for you37embed"
