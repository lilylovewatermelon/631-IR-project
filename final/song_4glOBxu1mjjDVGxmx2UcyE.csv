when you see me in the videos babe
do i make your body go crazy
or when you catch me in a magazine baby
do you rip me out and save my page
if my voice comes through your speakers
and you legs suddenly get weaker
this is for you yeah
im hoping its gon get you through
so i can get to you
tell me what you see when you think of me
i want this to be just like your fantasy
oh girl girl im coming over
got some things to show ya turn your stereo up

chorus
got some sex for your stereo
girl you wanna bump it
turn it up dont turn me down
promise that youll love it
now put your hands on the radio
dont be scared to touch it
imagine i was there
baby pulling on your hair
got some sex for your stereo
show me how you take it
my words move like hands
and im singing to you naked
got some sex for your stereo
girl you wanna bump it
turn it up dont turn me down
promise that youll love it
