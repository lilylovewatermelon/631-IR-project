judging by the look on the organgrinder
hell judge me by the fact that my face dont fit
its touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder
hes waiting for the day when he gets me

verse 1

i just need this stage to be seen
we all need a pantomime to remind us what is real
hold my eye and know what it means
