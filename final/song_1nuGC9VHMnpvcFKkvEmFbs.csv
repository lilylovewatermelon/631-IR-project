my hair might be a little too long for your taste my friend
my car might cost a little less than that suit youre wearing
im glad you stumbled in here on your business trip
before you close your tab remember i play for tips

prechorus 1
well i bet your wife is beautiful
and youre a really big soandso
well im not doin bad myself
hey friend dont you know

chorus 1
i play guitar and i sing my songs in the sunshine
captain and cokes and bar room jokes keep me feeling fine

chorus 2
and theres always a stage and a beautiful babe
to squeeze my lime
in my simple way guess you could say
im living in the big time

verse 2
i know ill probably never make a million bucks
but savings accounts and the irs never worry me much
i dont need that stuff cause ive got friends like you
to buy me drinks have boats and planes that i can use
