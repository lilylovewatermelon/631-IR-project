verse 1 50 cent
you could have it your way how do you want it
you gon back that thing up or should i push up on it
temperature risin okay lets go to the next level
dance floor jampacked hot as a tea kettle
ill break it down for you now baby its simple
if you be a nympho i be a nympho
in the hotel or in the back of the rental
on the beach or in the park its whatever you into
got the magic stick im the love doctor
have your friends teasin you bout how sprung i got you
wanna show me you could work it baby no problem
get on top then get to bounce around like a low rider
im a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
after you work up a sweat you could play with the stick
im tryin to explain baby the best way i can
ill melt in your mouth girl not in your hand haha

postchorus 50 cent  olivia
girl what we do what we do
and where we do and where we do
the things we do things we do
are just between me and you yeah oh yeah

verse 2 50 cent
give it to me baby nice and slow
climb on top ride like you in a rodeo
you aint never heard a sound like this before
cause i aint never put it down like this
soon as i come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper
its like its a race who could get undressed quicker
isnt it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
had me thinkin bout that ass after im gone
i touched the right spot at the right time
lights on or lights off she like it from behind
so seductive you should see the way she whine
her hips in slowmo on the floor when we grind
long as she aint stoppin homie i aint stoppin
drippin wet with sweat man its on and poppin
on my champagne campaign bottle after bottle its on
and we gon sip til every bubble in every bottle is gone
