ahhhhhh oooooo

verse 1
this is the way
i always dreamed it would be
the way that it is oh oh
when you are holding me
i never had a love of my own
maybe thats why when were all alone

chorus
i can hear music
i can hear music
the sound of the city baby seems to disappear
i can hear music
sweet sweet music
whenever you touch me baby
whenever youre near

verse 2
loving you
it keeps me satisfied
and i cant explain oh no
the way im feeling inside
you look at me we kiss and then
i close my eyes and here it comes again
