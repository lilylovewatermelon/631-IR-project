if i had a world of my own everything would be nonsense
nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isnt

verse 1
i invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time
and every creature lends themself to change your state of mind
and the girl that chased the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill
has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels

prechorus 1
to stand outside your virtue
no one can ever hurt you
or so they say

chorus
her name is alice alice
she crawls into the window through shapes and shadows
alice alice
and even though shes dreaming she knows

verse 2
sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain
and every ounce of innocence is left inside her brain
and through the looking glass we see shes painfully returned
but now off with her head i fear is everyones concern
see shinedown liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus 2
you see theres no real ending
its only the beginning
come out and play

chorus
her name is alice alice
she crawls into the window through shapes and shadows
alice alice
and even though shes dreaming shes unlocked the meaning for you

prechorus 3
this kingdom good riddance
her freedom and innocence
has brought this whole thing down

chorus
her name is alice alice
she crawls into to the window through shapes and shadows
alice alice
and even though shes dreaming shes unlocked the meaning

bridge
red knights white knights marching into the fight
drink me shrink me fill me to sink me
red knights white knights marching into the fight
drink me shrink me fill me to sink me
shes unlocked the meaning for you
outro spoken
and contrariwise what it is it wouldnt be
and what it wouldnt be it would you see4embed"
