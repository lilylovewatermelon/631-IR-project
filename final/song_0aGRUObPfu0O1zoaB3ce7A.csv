verse 1 chris brown
the meanest the meaner the second i seen her
had me open got me looking losing all my control
the passion im feining baby youre the new meaning
but i found myself tripping when you walked through the door
and i know its not like me getting beside myself
she got me feeling that way
and i know its unlikely that youre gon deny me
and just walk away

prechorus chris brown

its looking like a schedule is bout the same
the ball is in your court im ready for your game
its looking like your neck is ready for my chain
