it all started back in 1981
our life together had just begun
i didnt know what my future would hold
but you gave me a chance so i set out on the road

verse 2
it wasnt easy going then
there were times i almost threw that old towel in
but you kept calling me back to the stage
and i finally found my place in each and every face

chorus
im not saying im through by any means
theres still things that i want to say and do
i hope you wont forget me cause weve shared a lot dreams
and just know that ill always remember you

bridge
when i first set out on the road i figured
i had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks
well its going on thirty now
and i still love it just as much as i ever did
when i hear that announcer say my name
and i walk through those curtains
and see your smiling faces
my feet dont touch the ground again
till i walk out and get back on that bus that got me here
i dont know how many more years ive got left to do this
but i figure a few
i do want you to know though
that when i do walk off this stage for the last time
and im all settled in away from all this
you wont be far away
ill still hear your screams and cheers in my mind
and ill always remember you

im not saying im through by any means
theres still things that i want to say and do
i hope you wont forget me cause weve shared a lot dreams
and just know that ill always remember you

outro
youve pulled me through some hard times
hope ive pulled you through a few
and just know that ill always remember youembed"
