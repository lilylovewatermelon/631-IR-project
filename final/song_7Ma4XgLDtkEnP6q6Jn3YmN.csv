so i wail every time i hit the floor
im dragging and im bleeding
im begging and im pleading
cause i thought you had another
and you cannot have another lover
i dont believe in a loving with a ball and chain
cause i feel how it crippled me inside
i thought you were a cheating
i couldnt bear you leaving
now i know you didnt do it
i need you to believe me when i say
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
baby i didnt mean it
so i accused you wrong
now im the guilty one
hey give me my sentence
ill pay my penance
nothing kills me more
than the pain i have for hurting you
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
baby i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
baby i didnt mean it
hey
hooooo oooo
hooooo oooo
hey
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
baby i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
i didnt mean it
what i said
i didnt mean it
baby i didnt mean it
