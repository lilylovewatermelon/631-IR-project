come on let’s go
ain’t nobody gonna get in my way
no no no no
i’m gonna make it no matter what you say
alright alright
i’m flying by you better stay in your lane
it’s on tonight
ain’t nobody gonna get in my way

verse 1
set free out of jail
i’m tired of living in my own hell
i can see a life beyond this cell
no steel can hold me in call the guards and let the sirens ring
working hard like there’s a gun in my back
i be battin’ one thousand with a weight on my bat

hook

verse 2
can’t censor me
this fire is wild
it’s burning free
it’s meant to be
inventing my own reality
come on and set it loose
let it go and dream this dream with me
working hard like there’s a gun in my back
i be battin’ one thousand with a weight on my bat

bridge
the ribbon hits my chest
the wind at my back
the feeling of elation running all down my back
my feet hardly hit the ground
i feel i’m walking on clouds
i did it
no fear no more
