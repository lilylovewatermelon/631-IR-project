everything you do is planned out in advance
and the stars push their dark wills down on you
and wolves all tear themselves apart better in packs
its just a function that we will have to work on through

refrain
were machines that eat and breathe and look really cool
youre reacting just the way i thought you would

chorus
and ive replaced my heart with metal parts
and im working out just fine but i cant get it to start
were machines that breathe and weep and look really good
trained to kill

verse 2
send me back in time and ill bring us back in line
just tell me whose mother i have to kill
im fine like ive always been and i dont remember when
my conscience wasnt acting up again

chorus
and ive replaced my heart with metal parts
and im working out just fine but i cant get it to start
were machines that breathe and weep and look really good
trained to killyou might also like18embed"
