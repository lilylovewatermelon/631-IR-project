verse 1
somethings wrong
but im scared to look it up
if i do that and no one has it
ill feel so alone
somethings wrong
but dont pity me for long
if you get sad then ill feel bad
that i told you at all

prechorus
i got friends in a lot of weird places
wonder if theyre gonna call
depending what my face is what my face is
i could fake it i could move away
or i could suck it up and face it

hide behind your pillow close the window
