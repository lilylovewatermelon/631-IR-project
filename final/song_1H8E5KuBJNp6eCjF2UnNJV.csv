lyin on the floor just playin my guitar
tryin to find the chords for just the way you are
plane crash flashin on my tv
well it coulda been you baby it coulda been me
well never live forever
but maybe things could be worse
cause when we get together
we are one with the universe

bridge
woohoo woohoo

verse 3
sometimes i think i might just move up to vermont
open up a bookstore or a vegan restaurant
got crazy karma never harmed a single soul
so if you wanna join me then together well grow old
