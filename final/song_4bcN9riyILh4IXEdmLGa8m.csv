jealousys an ugly word but you dont seem to care
converse behind my back but now im here
need no one to comply with me through everyone that i defeat
dont need you fuck camaraderie this rage will never go away

chorus 1
hatred fuels my blood ill burn ya down you cant help me
one king to watch the horsemen fail ill fight til the end i wont help you
i cant trust anyone see it in my eyes
now i can understand its sorrow that feeds your lies

verse 2
youre on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
a crutch for you that wont always be there
hide in the dark another day the fear in you is here to stay
so keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words i say

chorus 2
hatred fuels my blood ill burn ya down you cant help me
one king to watch the horsemen fail ill fight til the end i wont help you
i cant trust anyone witness and see it in my eyes
now i can understand put faith in you for the last time
its sorrow that feeds your lies

verse 3
run from me before i tear you down be afraid
you chose the wrong side it feels so right
i wont help you let you rot away despise what you say
run towards the light exposing your soul we wont be there by your side
salvations dying somebodys crying
were all gone in the end
sweet child well miss you
so far away far away
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likebridge
i cant trust anyone witness and see it in my eyes
now i can understand put faith in you for the last time
its sorrow that feeds your lies

falling away cant buy back time
