i need you to pray for me and
i need you to care for me and
i need you to want me to win
i need to know where im heading cause i know where ive been
the flow is bone crushing its nothing i come up with something
come through your strip frontin stuntin its something you want
745 chrome spinners haters hate that im winning
man ive been hot from the beginning
motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
cause i cant control my temper im finna catch a felony
pistol in hand homie im down to get it poppin
once i squeeze the first shot you know i aint stoppin
til my clip is empty im simply
not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
what nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling

chorus 50 cent
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy

i done lost my bigger nigga and i didnt cry
too young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie
i gotta get that money ill be damned if im bummy
gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
twenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated heavily weeded
smoking that bong cause i need it
these niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
laying with bugs under my shirt
i got plans to hop up in that hummer cause im a stunner
i sit back and wonder when them angels gon call my number
under my chest is a heart of a lion i aint lyin
bounty hunters got me flying with my iron high as a giant
im running from nothing my stomach is touching what im clutching
to give you more than a concussion end of discussion
my blood is colder so im bolder hennessy and soda
hood on my shoulder look in the mirror i see a soldier

chorus 50 cent  eminem
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy em drop that shit cmon
verse 3 eminem
these are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
this is shit that i saw with my eyeballs my ears what else
this is me whos gotta be what you see on tv
what you hear on cd what appears easy what else
man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
in these beanies and these rags living fantasies frontin cmon
like its all fun and games til they shoot em up bang
and you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
i bullied my way in this game man im done playing
man im done saying that im done playing
ima start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers cmon
theres no way ima back down like a goddamn coward i cant
how would i look as a man bowing to his knees
like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
and not lash back out at em please
oh woah yo ho
hold up oh no not me not marshall
you wanna see marshall ill show you martial
i try to show you art but you just pick it apart
so i see i have to start showing you fucking old farts
a whole nother side i wanted to not show you cmon
so you know youre not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
little soft yellow punk pussy whose hearts jello cause
chorus 50 cent
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy
right now im on the edge so dont push me
i aim straight for your head so dont push me
fill your ass up with lead so dont push me
i got something for your ass keep thinking im pussy
