stoplight lock the door
dont look back
undress in the dark
and hide from you all of you

prechorus
youll never know the way your words have haunted me
i cant believe youd ask these things of me ever and ever
ever and ever you dont know me
ever and ever now and ever

chorus
you belong to me
my snow white queen
theres nowhere to run
so lets just get it over
soon i know youll see
youre just like me
dont scream anymore my love
cause all i want is you

verse 2
wake up in a dream
frozen fear
all your hands on me
i cant scream i cant scream
see evanescence liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus
i cant escape the twisted way you think of me
i feel you in my dreams and i dont sleep ever and ever
ever and ever i dont sleep

chorus
say you belong to me
my snow white queen
theres nowhere to run
so lets just get it over
soon i know youll see
youre just like me
dont scream anymore my love
cause all i want is you

bridge
i cant save your life
though nothing i bleed for is more tormenting
im losing my mind
and you just stand there and stare as my world divides

chorus
you belong to me
my snow white queen
theres nowhere to run
so lets just get it over
soon i know youll see
youre just like me
dont scream anymore my love
cause all i want is you
outro
all i want is you
all i want is you
all i want is you ever and ever
ever and ever3embed"
