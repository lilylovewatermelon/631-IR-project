where you from fool
this world is about to change change
1 2 1234

verse 1
look into my eyes and look at the words you say
blood on your tongue with a crass embrace
i found a kiss on the day we met and said
this will be a night we wont forget

prechorus
speak slow now i dont want to miss when you cry
glass over diamond blue eyes

chorus
and its good enough to make me wanna fall in love
so move a little bit closer hear the sound of your voice
were screaming why cant we just be friends
its not that easy but its half of the fun
to see you throw the first punch now

verse 2
such a shame you had to go and run your mouth
life is what you make it but at least ive got real friends
can you hear me now now that im a big star
fuck you and your new love for yourself
it dont mean shit
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
and its good enough to make me wanna fall in love
so move a little bit closer hear the sound of your voice
were screaming why cant we just be friends
its not that easy but its half of the fun
to see you throw the first punch now

bridge
ive got so much to give
but i would kill just to feel less invisible
and youve got so much to learn about gravity
so live it up baby dont look down
live it up baby dont look down
hahaha

chorus
and its good enough to make me wanna fall in love
so move a little bit closer hear the sound of your voice
were screaming why cant we just be friends
its not that easy but its half of the fun

postchorus
and i saw it coming when you threw the first punch
you threw the first punch
now its your turn to run
outro
this is the breath that will take my life
theres no future but matches and propane
and through the mutated words i write
kill it fast and never watch it die16embed"
