all it takes is some voli on the rocks havana brown
next thing you know shes on top of the bar
no clothes fosho afrojack
shes telling me to slow down i live a fast life mr worldwide
funny thing is she wasnt saying that last night dale

chorus havana brown
i cant believe what we did last night
im gonna wake up in the morning sun
going nowhere telling everyone
i cant believe what we did last night
i wanna say oh my god that was so much fun
ill never forget it telling everyone about last night

verse 1 pitbull
last night we were off the chain
you name it we did it
you loved it fosho
i cant remember her name but her ass that i remember fosho
convenient amnesia
remember the good forget the bad
remember the present forget the past
she dont get down then forget that ass

verse 2 pitbull
different night different city
different girl but its all the same
i party every night like my last
be careful buddy you might run into my past
i dont got a conscience
and i dont got time to deal with the nonsense
i came to get off to everything
so alert all the bondsmen ha
