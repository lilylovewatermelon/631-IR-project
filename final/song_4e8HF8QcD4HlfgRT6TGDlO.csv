i cannot find a way to describe it
its there inside all i do is hide
i wish that it would just go away
what would you do you do if you knew
what would you do

chorus
all the pain i thought i knew
all the thoughts lead back to you
back to what was never said
back and forth inside my head
i cant handle this confusion
im unable come and take me away

verse 2
i feel like i am all alone
all by myself i need to get around this
my words are cold i dont want them to hurt you
if i show you i dont think youd understand
cause no one understands understands

chorus
all the pain i thought i knew
all the thoughts lead back to you
back to what was never said
back and forth inside my head
i cant handle this confusion
im unable come and take me away

im going nowhere on and on
and off and on and off and on

chorus
all the pain i thought i knew
all the thoughts lead back to you
back to what was never said
back and forth inside my head
i cant handle this confusion
im unable come and take me away

break me away
