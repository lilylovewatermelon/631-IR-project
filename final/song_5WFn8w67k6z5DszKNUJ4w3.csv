i noticed something about me
i didnt know i didnt see
back when i tend to take for granted
the ones who had made a man of me
that kid i was he had no clue
that hed make the man
standing right here in front of you

chorus
i was born my old mans son
my mommas secret weapon her loaded gun
from the way i laugh to the way i hold a womans hand
everywhere i go wherever i run
ill be my old mans son

verse 2
lot of things go down
in an everybody knows kinda town
theyre all a small town genius
theres a lot of space between us
i got something they aint got
im someone that theyre not

chorus
i was born my old mans son
my mommas secret weapon her loaded gun
from the way i laugh to the way i hold a womans hand
everywhere i go wherever i run
ill be my old mans son

took some time to see
to realize what it means to be
born my old mans son
my mommas secret weapon her loaded gun
from the way i laugh
to the way i hold a womans hand
everywhere i go wherever i run
ill be my old mans son
my old mans son
my old mans son
