when you need picked up because you fell down
need a piggyback ride or a birthday clown
need a song to take you to sleepy town ill be there
when you need a coach or you need a fan
need a castle built out of ocean sand
or a rainbow chaser
im your man
ill be there

chorus
ill be a tear dryer
a paper airplane flyer
a monster runneroffer if you get scared
ill be a sap ill be a sucker
a story makerupper

verse 2
anytime anything anywhere ill be there
when you break your heart or skin your knee
need a big old hug or a bowl of ice cream
i promise you can count on me

chorus

outro
anytime anything anywhere
ill be there if you need a frown turned to a grin
or you need a hand just to hold your hand
need a daddy or you just need a friend
ill be there
ill be there
