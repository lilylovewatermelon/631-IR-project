verse 1
people like you always want back
the love they gave away
and people like me wanna believe you
when you say youve changed
the more i think about it now
the less i know
all i know is that you drove us
off the road

chorus

had me in the palm of your hand then
whyd you have to go and lock me out when i let you in
stay hey now you say you want it back
now that its just too late well couldve been easy

postchorus
