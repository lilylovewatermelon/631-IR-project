verse tyler the creator
all yall niggas smoking yall brains out
in the car called life took the lame route
going nowhere fast but you think that you not
cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
in the drop top pop the trunk then poppop
at his drop top took another lame out
oh you the big nigga take a hit nigga
well i hope you understand you aint shit nigga
cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
and make sure that your mama cry the pain out
now that gangs out to get you but you stuck in the same house
nigga never came out wow
its a shame how you got sucked in that life
but hey man at least you got a name now
they say you a real nigga cause you kill niggas
nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
banana clips spill niggas wanna bang out
for approval boy you cant even hang out
that light you hit it was the light i held
thats why you never ever see me with my chain out
i dont need to truth they dont feed you
lies what they got on their plate they gon eat you
they got a homie called karma he gon meet you
better look the other way if he ever see you
and run as fast as you can nigga
