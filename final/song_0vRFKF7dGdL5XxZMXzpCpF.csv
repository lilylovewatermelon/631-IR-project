if youre lookin for love know that love dont live here anymore
he left with my heart
they both walked through that door without me
if youre trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
cause i surely cant help you
im hurtin myself
ive turned into someone else

verse 1
i used to believe love conquers all
cause thats whats seen in movies
come to find out its not like that at all
you see real lifes much different

refrain
i dont wanna see you go
i only wanna see you smile
it hurts so much to see you now
felt like this for awhile
i cant stand to see us fail
we tried we lied cannot pretend
to take us back to what we had
to make us feel alive again

prechorus
hold me close dont let me go
i hope tell me now is not the end

verse 2
i used to believe love conquers all

i thought youd catch me if i fall
and fill me up when im empty
