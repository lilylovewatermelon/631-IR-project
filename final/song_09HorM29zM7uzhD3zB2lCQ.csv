you were in that twopiece in the bucket seat
of  my old mans red camaro
rolling  down to port saint joe
that fm dial cranked up to ten had mellencamp
and i was picking out little pink houses
all  the way down the coast

prechorus
i  got lost in your smile
i was flying down 59
and  taking in every mile

chorus
that first time loving feeling
midnight kiss im stealin
pullin me in like we were there all along
firsttime  tequila buzz
thinkin every song that played was us
singin all the wrong words all night long
you were my first love
my first broken heart
thats all you were to me
just my first everything

verse 2
we left our shoes and our clothes
up on the dock and we found an empty spot
threw a blanket down in the sand
we tried to take it slow
for moving fast just to make it last
but when the sun came up on us i was a man
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likechorus
that first time loving feeling
midnight kiss im stealin
pullin me in like we were there all along
firsttime tequila buzz
thinkin every song that played was us
singin all the wrong words all night long
you were my first love
my first broken heart
thats all you were to me
just my first everything
you were my first everything
