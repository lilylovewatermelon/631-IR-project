everybody wants to give in
something about a second chance
cant you help me out

chorus
if i could love you 3x

through the wind i can feel
through the trees i can steal
but you never ever want to see my way
but were here in the dark and the dogs starting to bark
cause im selfish and youll never get your way its okay

chorus
if i could love 3x

bridge
somethings going on in me that you never wanna see
i think somethings wrong with you
but you know that i love you
you dont seem to be around even when everythings going down
why dont you wanna feel my pain

chorus
if i could love you
youre driving me crazy crazy crazy babyyou might also likeembed"
