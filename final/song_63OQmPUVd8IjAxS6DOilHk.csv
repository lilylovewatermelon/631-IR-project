i dont know why
all i know is i cant hide
at this temperature you could take over my mind

like gossamer you softly touch
he draws me in
im powerless
he possesses an enchantment

tell me
im forgiven
he calls dont know how i fell under his spell
lately ive been driven
he smiles an enchantment

i wait for you
im mesmerized
this love is like a potion in disguise
i tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes
i cant escape
or so it seems
id run away
hes in my dreams
he possesses an enchantment
see corinne bailey rae liveget tickets as low as 47tell me im forgiven
he calls dont know how i fell under his spell
lately ive been driven
he smiles an enchantment

its the kind of sleepwalk that never ends
a type of loan with no dividends
its a parlor game where youre given chase
guess it could be called an acquired taste

i know he knows
he calls i go
i know
this could be an enchantment

why dont you tell me
im forgiven
he calls dont know how i fell in love his spell

im forgiven
lately
ive been driven
he smiles and i give in
