i dont give a fidduck abiddout the widdate
you used to move what you used to do
and i dont give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
that you used to screw what your future do
and we dont really care what you used to say
unless that affects your future pay
im on a practice field runnin twoadays
so i dont drop the ball when its threw my way
so i dont give a fidduck abiddout the shit
that you probably did who you probably is
the only time i deal in past tense
cause im past rims and im past tints
if you drivin it i drove it
you got it cause i sold it
you copped it i bought it back
and we dont give a fidduck nigga we off that
