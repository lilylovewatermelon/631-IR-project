her hands wrapped up in mine
tears rollin out of her eyes
no messin with a madeup mind
sun settin on goodbye
yeah its hard to believe
it wasnt me tryin to leave this time

chorus
it aint always the cowboy
that aint got a lot of hang around
aint got no settle down in their boots
gones just what they do
that restless running searchin for something
leavin love in the dust of a midnight chevrolet
it aint always the cowboy that rides away

verse 2
ive never seen over from this side
never heard lonely get this quiet
still i cant keep from smiling
cause damn that girl can fly

chorus
it aint always the cowboy
that aint got a lot of hang around
aint got no settle down in their boots
gones just what they do
that restless running searchin for something
leavin love in the dust of a midnight chevrolet
it aint always the cowboy that rides away
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
a tumbleweed heart chasin that wind
goin too far wherever that is

chorus
it aint always the cowboy
that aint got a lot of hang around
aint got no settle down in their boots
gones just what they do
that restless running searchin for something
leavin love in the dust of a midnight chevrolet
it aint always the cowboy that rides away
rides away
it aint always the cowboy3embed"
