let yourself be light
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on our troubles will be miles away
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the faiths allow
until then well have to muddle through somehow
so have yourself a merry little christmas now
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the faiths allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
and have yourself a merry little christmas nowyou might also likeembed"
