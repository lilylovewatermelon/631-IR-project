i know what you want
im gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
if you can keep a secret
i got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

prechorus 1
and a little place that sits beneath the sky
she turned her face to speak but no one heard her cry

chorus 1
drive faster boy
drive faster boy ooh yeahooh

verse 2
i know theres a hope
theres too many people tryin to help me cope
you got a real short skirt
i wanna look up look up look up yeah yeah
we were just in time
let me take a little more off your mind
theres somethin in my head somewhere in the back sayin
we were just a good thing we were such a good thing

prechorus 2
make it go away without a word
but promise me youll stay and fix these things ive heard

oh make it go away oh
drive faster boy ooh yeahooh
oh no

prechorus 3
a crashing tide cant hide a guilty girl
with jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
i took my babys breath beneath the chandelier
of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear

chorus 3
into the midnight show
afaster afaster afaster afaster faster afaster
oh no no no no no no
no no no no no

outro
if you can keep a secret
well baby i can keep it if you can keep a secret
she said she loved me
if you can keep a secret i can keep a secret
she said she loved me
if you can keep a secret
well baby i can keep it if you can keep a secret10embed"
