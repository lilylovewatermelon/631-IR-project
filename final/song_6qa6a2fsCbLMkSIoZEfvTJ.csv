i had a dream that the whole world was starin at me
i woke up and wasnt no one there
wasnt no one there yeah
same song to a different beat
cause really sometimes i feel like im the only one here
i guess nobody cares
but everythings good til it goes bad
and you gon’ tell all the people about the fun you used to have
it hurts when it dont last
no easy way saying bye
so imma spread my wings and head for the sky
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i fly solo

verse 1
im tired of being tired
and dealin with your bs
all the while supplyin
the money for your request
without me youre a dime
but with me youre a buck fifty
i can get another one quickly
but id rather wait it out
take the broken pieces try and fix it
or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
and ill be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit

verse 2
remember what you said
but what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the gospel
i was doing good way before i met you
now youre off the set
and imma let you see the show go on without you
take a bow think about it
and hopefully we could be friends but i really doubt it
see you be catching feelings now and i be catching planes
the story of my life youre just another page
refrain ii
but everythings good until it goes bad
and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
it hurts when it dont last
no easy way saying bye
so imma spread my wings and head for the sky
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
