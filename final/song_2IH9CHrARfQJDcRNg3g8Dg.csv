i feel no pain
if i am wrong
no one cares anyway

midnight on a sunny day
you know the most i can take
midnight on a sunny day
you chase the bad vibes away

i dont care
who you used to be
its not fair
thats old news to me
its alright
i know youve changed
everyone has bad days

midnight on a sunny day
you know the most i can take
midnight on a sunny day
you chase the bad vibes away

away away away away
