here she comes awalkin in cotton dress aswishin
the smoke is thick and the lights are dim and she sure got me wishin
for a little bit of time out on that ol dance floor
if she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home

verse 2
well hey bartender see that girl ask her what shes drinkin
tell her if she looks this way ill be the one awinkin
cause i saw her light up when the dj played a little george jones
if she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home

chorus
cause if we got to twosteppin we could come up missin
and find a corner booth of our own

man this feelings comin on strong
if she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home get to dancin boy

bridge
what the hell is wrong with me i feel like im sinkin
how hard can it really be to tell her what im thinkin

chorus
that if we got to twosteppin we could come up missin
and find a corner booth of our own
just ahuggin and akissin like two lovers reminiscin
man this feelings comin on strong
if she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home
