im counting back
the number of the steps
it took for me to get
back on the wagon of the weekend
ill use the autotimer to prove that ill
get home with my imagination
if they find the body in the basement
in the very house that she was raised in
im taking down
the number of the times
so when we get the sign
from god ill be the first to call them
im taking back the number of the beast
cause six is not a pretty number
eight or three are definitely better
a is for the address on the letter
to my alcoholic friends

verse 2
im trying hard
not to be ashamed
not to know the name
of who is waking up beside me
or the date the season or the city
but at least the ceilings very pretty
and if you are holding it against me
you might also likebridge
ill be on my best behavior
taking shots for mother nature
once my fist is in the cupboard
love is never falling over
hey
one two three four

outro
should i choose a noble occupation
if i did id only show up late and sick
and they would stare at me with hatred
plus my only natural talents wasted on my alcoholic friends
my alcoholic friends
the party never ends
