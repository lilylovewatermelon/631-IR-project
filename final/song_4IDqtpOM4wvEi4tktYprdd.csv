new york city 1977 here we go
are you living your teens in a shed
is growing up giving you the bends
is my little sunshine getting jealous of the moonbeams
feeling gloomy in your bed
you left your friends where the pavement ends
the road of broken bones begins
between here and now

verse 1 john gourley
theres glitter falling and a banner that says welcome to hell
make yourself at home but leave behind free will
can you feel me now

chorus john gourley  zoe manville
you know i cant feel this pain in my heart
because its hard to see it falling apart
maybe im too blind to see why trouble finds me
but if its here id rather see where it leads
call me mr lonely

postchorus zach carothers  zoe manville
you can call me anything call me if you know me
you can call me king i got 48 below me
you can call me anything call me if you know me
you can call me king but that aint no one below me
you can call me king im the king you wanna know me
but no one calls me call me mr lonely

bridge zoe manville
do you whisper your dreams to the deaf hello
deny that its all in your head that thought
the bitter past sleeps sitting pretty in a limousine
looking cruely underfed the real king
leave your friends where the pavement ends
the road of broken promise begins
feet dont fail me now
outro fat lip
broken promises alcohol anonymous
inducted in the hall of fame for vomiting
i puked around the world im the duke of earl
i used to have a girl but she wasnt happy
she left me naturally she left with natalie
they left in the back of a taxi they was laughing at me
so i lit the club bottles up popping shit
false sense of happiness perhaps ill take what i get
i guess its better than nothing right least i got this blunt to light
im doing what i want tonight tomorrow im like fuck my life
laugh once cry twice im bad at taking good advice
man this lonely life aint nothing nice6embed"
