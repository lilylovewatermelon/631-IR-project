ive not learned how to draw
ive not learned how to draw
what if you die with all of the cameras
part ii petrichor
take something and then make it brand new
try and do anything fourteen times
love yourself like someone you love one you love
dont take any of my advice my advice

dont let the internet ruin your time
they can take anything as long as its true
what they cant take is you telling them lies lies lies liessee the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also like22embed"
