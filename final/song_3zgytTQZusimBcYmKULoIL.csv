well she takes her last drag
and the thought of what she had
of her last cigarette
she thought enough of him
to get his name drawn on her skin
and its all permanent

verse
theres a rose or so im told
where that old name used to go
that says good riddance

she thinks another drink
will drown it out without a doubt
and keep things hidden

chorus
well there aint enough ink in her arm
to cover up the charm of the man that she wants
but in a week she probably wont
tattooed roses they dont cover up the pain
wеll they just cover up his name
and a poor dеcision stain that once was love
she thought it once was love
she thought she thought wrong

theres a tattoo on her arm
thats the outline of a heart
that still aint finished
she wants to fill it in
but she dont have the time to spend on bad decisions
theres a rose or so im told
where that old name used to go
that says good riddance

chorus
well there aint enough ink in her arm
to cover up the charm of the man that she wants
but in a week she probably wont
tattooed roses they dont cover up the pain
well they just cover up his name
and a poor decision stain that once was love
she thought it once was love
she thought she thought wrong

outro
well there aint enough ink in her arm
to cover up the charm of the man that she wants
but in a week she probably wont
tattooed roses they dont cover up the pain
no they just cover up his name
and a poor decision stain that once was love
she thought it once was love
she thought she thought wrong
she thought she thought wrong
she thought she thought wrongembed"
