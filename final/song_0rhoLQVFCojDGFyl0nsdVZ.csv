we can remember swimmin in december
headin for the city lights in 1975
were sharin each other nearer than farther
the scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

prechorus
we are the people that rule the world
a force running in every boy and girl
all rejoicing in the world
take me now we can try

verse 2
we lived an adventure love in the summer
followed the sun til night reminiscing other times of life
for each every other the feeling was stronger
the shock hit eleven we got lost in your eyes

chorus
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
cant you be believin now
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
cant you be believin now

can you remember and humanize
it was still where wed energize
lie in the sand and visualize like its 75 again

prechorus
we are the people that rule the world
a force running in every boy and girl
all rejoicing in the world
take me now we can try

chorus
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
cant you be believin now
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
cant you be believin now

bridge
i know everything about you
you know everything about me
we know everything about us
i know everything about you
you know everything about me
we know everything about us
chorus
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
cant you be believin now
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me

cant you be believin now
i cant do well when i think youre gonna leave me
but i know i try
are you gonna leave me now
