we started
ive got so much so much shit to do dont even know where to start
be here forever
i think thats the plan you know
start here end up there
soon as you think somethings goin on you start back over
its never gonna be the same
i aint complainin though
i really wouldnt have it any other way
nigga

verse 1
every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do
sometimes i roll one when im stressed out and sometimes i roll two
here people sayin shit about the way i am but i know that aint true
at times i feel like im all by myself and i know you do too
i made some phone calls and checked emails cause im always grinding
aint no rush i do things slow cause its all about timing
some people think when you get to this point in life youve made it
ive seen so many settle for less thats when talent get wasted
i aint there but if i can ima try to be perfect
and for those who ridin with me ima try to make it worth it
i drink too much i prefer weed cause its better for the stress
i just woke up i dont get sleep boy my schedules a mess
see wiz khalifa liveget tickets as low as 73you might also likechorus
man i work hard goddamn shit
man i work hard what woah
man i work hard literally nigga work get your bags lets go
man i work hard we on nigga
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
no pain
man i work hard

verse 2
just left another one
just rolled another one
just got another check
bout to thumb through another one
fallin asleep on the plane no sleep the flight come with one
young nigga holdin it down dont care if it make you uncomfortable
hardly spend nights at the crib homie thats just how i live
dont even go hard for myself i got a wife and a kid
i dont ever question the biz nigga it is what it is
you niggas aint killin shit no you niggas aint killin shit
what they doin they say nothin
where they goin they say nothin
call my phone it aint nothin
i smoke a lot but dont judge me
prolly wake up earlier than all of you niggas
mafuckas always hate on the squad
but all the hatin mafuckas always hatin aint get paid
chorus
man i work hard
man i work hard fuck
man i work hard i mean like goddamn what you want me to say
man i work hard its what i do
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
it aint no gain it aint no gain no gain without bein no pain
no pain
man i work hard19embed"
