day after day
seems like i push against the clouds
section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
they just keep blocking out the sun
it seems since i was born
ive wakened every blessed morning
i been thinkin to myself lately
wonderin did she mean it when she say she hate me
or wonderin did she mean it when she say she wished she didnt keep the baby down on my luck and up against the wind

verse 1
told solid to speed it up you aint driving miss daisy
rolls royce truck plus yeah you driving lil baby
hit from the back and grab her neck it be drivin her crazy
aint work no job since we met im the reason she lazy
i got some checks that i aint touch they for loyal and jason
really wanna have a daughter just so i can spoil her
maybe look at women different
father god forgive me ima been sinning for a minute
we bought sticks when it was tension
fuck that bitch she want attention
she get famous if i mention
i aint gon say her name at all
i was just sittin in prison damn near livin like a dog
i remember that shit vividly i do this shit for yall
im not lookin for no sympathy wont cry about no loss
i got demons all on my back and arms im tryna shake em off
i cant never fuck with lil mill again he tried to take me off
i cant lie you was my dawg i heard that shit it broke my heart
cant no nigga say i did somethin flawed been solid from the start
every situation ever happened baby played his part
i aint never did shit to brag about it i do that shit with honors
in my bag but i been layin back im turnin up this summer
guess you mad cause ive been havin tellin hoes i was a runner
if i was i was the richest runner in georgia on my mama
and i aint never been no worker had my own number ask bruh
seven summers straight we went crazy called it good luck

i been keepin my distance i switched up my number
i done made all these millions im keepin my hunger
all this food in a big house my stomach still rumble
got the ball i wont fumble
i just touch down stay humble
i been keepin my distance i switched up my number
i done made all these millions im keepin my hunger
all this food in a big house my stomach still rumble
got the ball i wont fumble
i just touch down stay humble yeah

verse 2
thinkin bout that shit you said i cant get it out my head
i know that my heart is black so all my cars insides is red
i dont wanna argue with no one lets get this guap instead
i aint tryna beef with none these niggas cause all my opps is dead
if you ever run into police you better not tell
turn it up i might as well you know im so 4pf
fore i go i gotta say whats up to all the bros in jail
i know that they be listenin i know that hell be with me
and his lawyer cost onesixty i hope they unconvict him when he go back
follow him with a low jack then step on him like a doormat
doin dirt cant go back my mind straight aint no slackin
guns all in renee house you aint from the hood if you dont know madison
chorus
i been keepin my distance i switched up my number
i done made all these millions im keepin my hunger
all this food in a big house my stomach still rumble
got the ball i wont fumble
i just touch down stay humble
i been keepin my distance i switched up my number
i done made all these millions im keepin my hunger
all this food in a big house my stomach still rumble
got the ball i wont fumble
i just touch down stay humble yeah7embed"
