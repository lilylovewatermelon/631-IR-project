i drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
i thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
and even though your friends tell me youre doin fine
are you somewhere feeling lonely even though hes right beside you
when he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones i wrote you

prechorus calum
sometimes i start to wonder was it just a lie
if what we had was real how could you be fine
cause im not fine at all

chorus all luke
i remember the day you told me you were leavin
i remember the makeup running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didnt need them
like every single wish we ever made
i wish that i could wake up with amnesia
and forget about the stupid little things
like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
and the memories i never can escape
cause im not fine at all

verse 2 calum calum  luke
the pictures that you sent me theyre still livin in my phone
ill admit i like to see them ill admit i feel alone
and all my friends keep asking why im not around
it hurts to know youre happy yeah it hurts that you moved on
its hard to hear your name when i havent seen you in so long
