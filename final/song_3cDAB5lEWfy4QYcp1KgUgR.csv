its the keys to your daddys car
its a night alone underneath the desert stars
its a five oclock whistle
its the classroom bell
its a panama city at the window yell
a first kiss after a broken heart

chorus
we all wanna break the chains
feel the wind against our face
everybody wants the same thing
we wanna taste that freedom freedom
everybody round here wanna taste that freedom freedom
freedom

verse 2
its a pocket full of folded cash
its telling that boss he can kiss your ass
that ticket to your favorite show
getting lost in the rock n roll
close your eyes hands up high
go on and let it all gooh

chorus
we all wanna break the chains
feel the wind against our face
everybody wants the same thing
we wanna taste that freedom freedom
everybody round here wanna taste that freedom freedom
