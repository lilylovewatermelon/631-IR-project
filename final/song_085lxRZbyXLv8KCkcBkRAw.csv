catch your breath hit the wall
scream out loud as you start to crawl
back in your cage the only place
where they will leave you alone

prechorus
because the weak will seek the weaker til theyve broken them
could you get it back again would it be the same
fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense
left you with no defense
they tore it down

chorus
and i have felt the same
as you ive felt the same
as you ive felt the same

verse 2
locked inside the only place
where you feel sheltered where you feel safe
you lost yourself in your search to find
something else to hide behind

prechorus
because the fearful always preyed upon your confidence
did they see the consequence
when they pushed you around
the arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones
breaking them until theyve become
just another crown

and i have felt the same
as you ive felt the same
as you ive felt the same

bridge
refuse to feel anything at all
refuse to slip refuse to fall
you cant be weak you cant stand still
you watch your back because no one will

verse 3
you dont know why they had to go this far
traded your worth for these scars
for your only company
and dont believe the lies that they have told to you
not one word was true
youre alright youre alright youre alright

chorus
and i have felt the same
as you ive felt the same
as you ive felt the same
as you ive felt the same

as you ive felt the sameembed"
