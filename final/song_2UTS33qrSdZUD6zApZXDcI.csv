whoa elle
whats up doc

elle
love

emmett spoken
excuse me

elle
i put my faith in love
i followed where it led

emmett spoken
love led you here

elle
to my personal circle of hell
it has not worked out well
i wish that i were dead
cause instead of a wedding and love
im flunking out of school
a total laughing stock
someone he and his friends can just mock
so go on heres my head
just hit it with a rock
you might also likeemmett spoken
wait go back

sung
you came out here to follow a man
harvard law was just part of that plan
man what rich romantic planet are you from

elle spoken
malibu

emmett
instead of lying outside by the pool
you stalk some guy to an ivy league school
thats the weirdest reason i have—

elle spoken
oh whyd you come

emmett spoken
okay

sung
i grew up in the roxbury slums
with my mom and a series of bums
guys who showed me all the ways a man can fail
i got through law school by busting my ass
worked two jobs in addition to class
so forgive me for not weeping at your tale
elle spoken
well excuse me
just because youve got some kind of chip on your shoulder

emmett spoken
you know what youre right

sung
theres a chip on my shoulder
and its big as a boulder
with the chance ive been given
im gonna be driven as hell
im so close i can taste it
so im not gonna waste it
yeah theres a chip on my shoulder
you might wanna get one as well

elle spoken
im sorry but that sounds highly negative
wait two jobs plus law school
how do you do it

emmett
well i dont go to parties a lot
not good use of the time that ive got
cant spend hours doing my hair and staying in shape
elle spoken
i dont spend hours

emmett
but i know itll all be worthwhile
when i win my first lucrative trial
and buy my mom that great big house out on the cape

elle spoken
oh thats so sweet

emmett
no thats the chip on my shoulder
i hugged my mom and told her
with the chance ive been given
im gonna be driven as hell
though i cant take the day off
i just think of the payoff
you need a chip on your shoulder
little miss woods comma elle
elle spoken
i just need to prove to everyone that im serious

emmett spoken
what you need is to get to work
where are your law books

elle spoken
um well i know theyre here somewhere

emmett
you know this vanitys real picturesque
but it started its life as a desk
clear it off and find some room for books instead

elle spoken
what are you doing

emmett
can you live without this
can you live without that
i dont know what this is

elle spoken
its for hair

emmett spoken
wear a hat

sung
spend some time improving whats inside your head
out out put it in storage
sell it on ebay leave it behind
out out what are you angry
good so get angry you may find
the chip on your shoulder

elle spoken
ugh

emmett
the room just got colder

elle spoken
hey

emmett
but with the chance youve been given
why are you not driven as hell
theres just no way around it
youve gotta plough through til you—

elle spoken
found it

emmett
been reading it hard i can tell
greek chorus
tis a gift to be simple tis a gift to be free
mmm

elle spoken
bye warner have a great thanksgiving
say hi to your mom and dad for me
and grandma bootsie

emmett spoken
define malum prohibitum

elle spoken
malum prohibitum is um

emmett spoken
an act prohib

elle spoken
an act prohibited by law
like jaywalking or chewing gum in singapore

emmett spoken
therefore malum in se

elle spoken
is an action thats evil in itself
assault murder white shoes after labor day

emmett spoken
good where are you going

elle spoken
home of course its thanksgiving break remember

emmett spoken

emmett

elle spoken
thats not fair

emmett

sung
i dont know if youve noticed before
but each time warner walks through the door
your iq goes down to forty maybe less

elle spoken
huh

emmett
though its hardly my business to say
could it be the real thing in your way
is the very guy youre trying to impress

elle spoken
yes

elle with greek chorus
ive been smiling and sweet
and thoroughly beaten blowing my chance
lets not chase him away
lets face him and say hey punk lets dance
this chip on my shoulder
makes me smarter and bolder
no more whining or blaming
i am reclaiming my pride
grab that book and lets do this
instead of doodling hearts all through this

elle greek chorus
now theres a chip on my shoulder chip on my shoulder
lets see him knock it aside

greek chorus
ah
daughter of delta nu show em that youre no fool
daughter of delta nu
go back to school with a big chip on your shoulder

warner spoken
mr latimer was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation
without his sperm the child in question wouldnt exist

callahan spoken
now youre thinking like a lawyer
yes ms woods

elle spoken
mr huntington makes an excellent point
but did the defendant keep a log of every sperm emission made throughout his life

callahan spoken
interesting why do you ask

elle spoken
well unless the defendant attempted to contact every sexual encounter to find if a child resulted from those unions he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever
why now why this sperm

callahan spoken
i see your point

elle spoken
and by mr huntingtons standard all masturbatory emissions where the sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be calledreckless abandonment

callahan spoken
ms woods you just won your case

elle
oh my god

greek chorus
wait hold on we just won the case

elle  emmett
oh my god

greek chorus
elle got all up in warners face

elleemmettstudents
oh my god

greek chorus

aaron

enid

warner

callahan spoken
ms woods excellent work today
i assume youre applying for my internship
do you have a resumé

elle spoken
im one step ahead of you
here you go and thanks in advance for your consideration

callahan spoken
dear god its scented
three months ago i wouldve recycled this
make sure to put it on file

emmett
guess she got a chip on her shoulder
maybe some wise man told her
with the chance weve been given
weve gotta be driven as hell
she was something to see there
im just happy i could be there
first big test and she aced it
shes so close she can taste it
shes got a chip on her shoulder
guess you never can tell
