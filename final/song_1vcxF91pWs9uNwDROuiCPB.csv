it kills me not to know this but ive all but just forgotten
what the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
as the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is droppin
through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten

verse 1
there is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
and there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
but seldom do these words ring true when im constantly failing you
walls that we just cant break through until we disappear

prechorus
so tell me now
if this aint love then how do we get out
’cause i dont know

chorus
thats when she said i dont hate you boy i just want to save you
while theres still something left to save
whoaohoh whoaohoh
thats when i told her i love you girl but im not the answer
for the questions that you still have
whoaohoh whoaohoh

verse 2
and the day pressed on like crushing weights for no man does it ever wait
like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
bathed in flames we held the brand uncurled the fingers in your hand
pressed into the flesh like sand now do you understand

so tell me now
if this aint love then how do we get out
’cause i dont know

chorus
thats when she said i dont hate you boy i just want to save you
while theres still something left to save
whoaohoh whoaohoh
thats when i told her i love you girl but im not the answer
for the questions that you still have
whoaohoh whoaohoh

bridge
one thousand miles away theres nothing left to say
but so much left that i dont know
we never had a choice this world is too much noise
it takes me under it takes me under once again

interlude
i dont hate you
i dont hate you no

prechorus
so tell me now if this aint love
then how do we get out ’cause i dont know

thats when she said i dont hate you boy i just want to save you
while theres still something left to save
