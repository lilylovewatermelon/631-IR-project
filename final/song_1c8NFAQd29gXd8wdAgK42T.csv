i think youre cute ill keep you in the cellar
show you to the children kill me after dinner
youre alright
you look like someone i could bury in the garden
cover you in diamonds when i die

chorus
and when i die
and when i die
and when i die

verse 2
ill dig you up
ill tear out all your feathers
cook you in the oven burn myself
what is mommy cookin
she looks like a baby

chorus
you love me
do you love me
you wanna die

outro
you really wanna see us laughin at your body
floating down the river baby youre pathetic
you are god you are god you are god
you are god you are god you are god
you are godyou might also likeembed"
