mary and i were the perfect picture of love
but my world started spinnin around til it wasnt enough
i tried to hang on to the heaven she made just for me
but when i slipped and fell it drove her to hell and lord knows that i hate to see

chorus
mary go round mary go round
mary i wish youd stop takin your heartache to town
why cant you see that free love aint free
youll spin til you fall to the ground mary i wish that youd never found the mary go round

verse 2
now shes not the first to discover the devils playground
but this aint no game and these demons aint playin around
theyll make her believe they can drown all her pain with a drink
and if she sinks below its burnin my soul to watch em all laugh as they sing

chorus
mary go round mary go round
aw mary i wish youd stop takin your heartache to town
why cant you see honey free love aint free
youll spin til you fall to the ground mary i wish that youd never found the mary go round

outro
youll spin til you fall to the ground
mary i curse the day that you found the mary go roundyou might also likeembed"
