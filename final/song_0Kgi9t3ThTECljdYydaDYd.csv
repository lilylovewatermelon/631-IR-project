i want you to know the truth
cause ive been around before
thought i wasnt looking anymore

verse 2
been a fool for weeks
cause my heart stands for nothing and your souls too weak
got a will thats been around for days
goes far if you want it it needs to behave

prechorus
but then you you come around
big mistake

chorus
i dont want to know i dont want to know
we dont need a sign to know of better times

bridge
running around cause you beat yourself up
and you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
how much longer can you play with fire
before you turn into a liar
running around cause you beat yourself up
and you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
