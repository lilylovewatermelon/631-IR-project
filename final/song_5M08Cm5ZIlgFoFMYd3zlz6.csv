call the police this whole place is gonna burn
come on holly put the gun down for me
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you love money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
theyre trying to take it from us theyre trying to take it from us
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
youre so pretty when you dress for the grave

verse 1
love me as you lay
dizzy and falling your legs dangling
although accidents happen they happen to me
try to forget the beginning and end
forget the world
without removing the glass from your lips

chorus
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you love money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
theyre trying to take it from us theyre trying to take it from us
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
the suns coming up and were still awake
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeverse 2
am i the trigger of your gun
your pretty eyes dont give me much choice
but ill take them home
ive done some thinking of my own
and when i come home i want to be done
dont want to be famous no more
leave that girl alone

bridge
my teenage heartattack keeps talking back
keeps talking back to her
and i cant pretend that off this balcony
we wouldnt want to jump off of it
and put an end to this

outro
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
you love money and the sex in your veins
call the police this whole place is gonna burn
doll up and sleep walk until we have some teeth marks
narcotic sweet talk until we have some teeth marks
this whole place is gonna burn7embed"
