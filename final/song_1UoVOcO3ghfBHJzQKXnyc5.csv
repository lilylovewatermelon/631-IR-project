verse 1
theres no doubt in my mind when its over what is done will be
you will find when life gets colder theres no sympathy

chorus
theres no point trying you cant escape the bitter end
well who will greet you when youre at the bitter end

guitar solo

verse 2
all your choices chosen youve got no say your decisions made
face your consequences as your life begins to fade

chorus
as time keeps spinning closer to the bitter end
well who will greet you when youre at the bitter end

guitar solo

verse 3
take a look at yourself time keeps racing its all youve come to be
what you expected or are you still chasing possibilities

because all your prayers wont save you from the bitter end
well who will greet you when youre at the bitter end
the bitter end
the bitter end
