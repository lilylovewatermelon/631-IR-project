the rain is falling its after dark
the streets are swimming with the sharks
its the right night for the wrong company
and there aint nothing around here to look at
move along move along
the neon lights on baltimore
every shadows getting famous
in some backyard in some plastic chair
hoping these cigarettes will save us
here we go again
here we go again
you got rings in your ears
and you got kicked around and made up
looking high looking low
where did all the shadow people go
where did all the shadow people go
i want to know whoa
where the shadow people go
i stole a bike from the 2nd mile
i saw a band play in the basement
i crossed the path of a friend of mine
and i know what that look upon her face meant
somethings gone from her eye
somethings gone wrong
you could be a woman or you could be a man
wear the glove on the other hand
or you could be twisted
or you could be insane
pushing the envelope against the grain
just playing along
just playing along
and i got something on my mind
and i got voices on the other line
saying hi saying hello
where did all the shadow people go
where did all the shadow people go
i wanna know where the shadow people go
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeoutro
where did all the shadow people go
where the shadow people go
where did all the shadow people go
where did all the shadow people go
where the shadow people go
where did all the shadow people go
where the shadow people go
where the shadow people go1embed"
