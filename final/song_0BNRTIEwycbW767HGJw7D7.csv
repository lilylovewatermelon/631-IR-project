one horse town restless soul
wondering where the river and the freight trains go
two lane road hometown roots
were never gonna hold back my goodbye boots
just waiting on ready or not
you know the first chance i got

chorus
i got blacktop gone four lane fast
topping off the tank with some never look back
chase that sun race that wind
with them horses that you cant fence in
free like a freeway high on a highway
packing up a getaway soul
getting blacktop gone

verse 2
girl you look like you might
do a little running out on the wild side
i bet that kiss could slow me down
but if youre looking for mr stick around
that aint me
its like im born to be

chorus
blacktop gone four lane fast
topping off the tank with some never look back
chase that sun race that wind
with them horses that you cant fence in
free like a freeway high on a highway
packing up a getaway soul
getting blacktop gone
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
im just a good to go one night show
im ready to rock til im ready to roll

chorus
and get blacktop gone four lane fast
topping off the tank with some never look back
chase that sun race that wind
with them horses that you cant fence in
free like a freeway high on a highway
packing up a getaway soul
getting blacktop gone

outro
blacktop gone
girl were getting blacktop goneembed"
