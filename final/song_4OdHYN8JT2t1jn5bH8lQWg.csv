i know how it hurts
but i hate to hear those words
that youre good with being gone
and everything is wrong
dont you give up now
well make it through somehow
theres lots of living left
in this life not the next

chorus
the end is not the answer
you and i are in this together
dont you give up ever
cause the end is not the answer

verse 2
i know how it hurts
but i hate to hear those words
theres lots of living left
in this life not the next

chorus
the end is not the answer
you and i are in this together
dont you give up ever
cause the end is not the answer

everybody gets hurt sometimes
everybody gets lost sometimes
nobody knows when its their time
to go to go to go

chorus
the end is not the answer
you and i are in this together
dont you give up ever
cause the end is not the answer
the end is not the answer
you and i are in this together
dont you give up ever
cause the end is not the answer
the end is not the answer
you and i are in this together
dont you give up ever
cause the end is not the answerembed"
