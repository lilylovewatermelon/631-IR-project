chorus
woke up this morning cant remember nothing
two bitches just flew in from london two bitches
last thing i remember they callin me daddy
the mattress was covered in money in hunnids
went to sleep with my jewelry and chains on
had to wake up and recount the money recount it
i got a bitch she gon kill for real talk about clyde and bonnie brr

postchorus
coupe with the kit cop it got to
pull up with a stick stop it stop it
rich nigga shit solid rich nigga
old hunnids pockets rotted cottage
i go to space with the stars stars
might smoke a blunt with my pilot cookie
saturn moon earth and mars mars
nasa takeoff with the rocket nasa

verse
half a million on a necklace a half
young rich niggas we successful successful
said she wanna feel special she what
that coco make her feel special coco
i count a hunnid or better one hunnid
back end two hunnid or better two hunnid
i might go put all my chains on ice
i just might change up the weather change it
she pop a perc her pussy wetter drip
i met the bitch at coachella coachella
if she knew tell her shed probably do better
but can i get a e for effort e
i prayed to god to wash my sins god
nothing formed against me not a weapon no weapon
ask him where do i begin where
devil tryna take my blessings my blessings
they dont know the meaning of the white naw
you dont really live this life no
niggas in the hood shootin twice pew pew
see my niggas in the hood shoot precise brr
real wise we aint taking no advice naw
i realize that these hoes aint right all of em
dont even ask cause they know whats the price price
aint gotta snow they already know its white white
i talk to god cause i been baptized baptized

pull up with the sticks on the niggas straight slime skrtskrt
