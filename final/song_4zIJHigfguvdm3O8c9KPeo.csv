im a saint and im a sinner
im a loser and a winner
without faith and a believer
i am true and the deceiver
im a hero and a villain
im a myth and im a legend
without strength and a contender
i am real and the pretender

prechorus
take me as i am or dont
cause i dont give a damn no
take me as i am or dont
cause i dont give a damn no

chorus
i have my flaws
i make mistakes
but im myself
im not ashamed
thats who i am oh
thats who i am oh
thats who i am oh
i have my doubts
i lose my strength
sometimes i fall but i dont break
thats who i am oh
thats who i am oh
thats who i am oh

without hope but im a dreamer
im the cure and im the fever
i am lost with a direction
i am failure and perfection
without grace but i am tired
of walking life like its a wire
