readers can find a surfeit of descriptions of the specifics that pushed detroit over the precipice more than 100000 creditors are officially owed more than 1 billion though with unfunded pension fund liabilities and other issues the financial obligations of the beleaguered city could reach as much as 18 to 20 billion according to the stateappointed emergency manager kevyn d orr detroit joins stockton california harrisburg pennsylvania central falls rhode island jefferson county alabama and other communities in seeking the protection of federal courts against debts that they can’t repay

instead of addressing what might be involved in detroit’s potential protection under chapter 9 we’d like to raise issues for nonprofits and foundations concerned about detroit and other cities like it although detroit’s large foundation community led by the likes of the kresge foundation the skillman foundation the mcgregor foundation and the hudsonwebber foundation has been actively engaged and putting big dollars into detroit initiatives traction and results have been hard to come by many longstanding detroit nonprofits have not fared well in recent years some with organizational finances following detroit’s trajectory where do foundations and nonprofits go from here how can they participate in and help shape the necessary fixes for the motor city

investment capital there’s enough vacant space in detroit available for next to nothing to make detroit a city of startups while dan gilbert of quicken loans claims to have invested a billion in downtown detroit and to have moved 9000 employees to the area there are few corporate moguls who are going to recommend a similar corporate relocation but for small business startups and for entrepreneurs who need space subsidy and financing detroit is an ideal laboratory a couple of programs have emerged with entrepreneurship potentials including venture for america a program of placing program graduates in detroit and other troubled cities to counsel new startups and challenge detroit which induces college graduates to live and work in detroit and through the incentive of a stipend devote extra time to working with community organizations on community improvement projects although venture and challenge are both described as modeled on teach for america they seem to have more the feel of a vista or a peace corps

while this might be a distinct possibility for detroit’s future it has to begin from a premise entirely different than the dynamic that led to detroit’s economic abyss while detroit is 83 percent black the detroit metro area suburbs of oakland county macomb county and some parts of wayne county are predominantly white and in some cases among the most affluent communities in the nation the wealth generated by detroiters over the years has been taken out of the city and the poverty kept within the symbol of this was always eight mile road the line between the city and the suburbs where the bus system of detroit ended and the bus system of the suburbs began with dysfunctional or nonexistent linkages in between people of wealth moved out of detroit and took their wealth with them

if detroit is going to be the laboratory as it can be for a new entrepreneurial dynamic it has to be based on new conceptions of reinvestment and redevelopment that include and benefit rather than exclude and impoverish detroit’s remaining 700000 residents that means networking reinvestment to communitybased organizations building on rather than bypassing the infrastructure that exists in the community and maximizing the recirculation of capital inside the city rather than a dynamic of pure outflow
there is of course a racial dimension to all of this as joe darden and richard thomas noted in detroit race riots racial conflicts and efforts to bridge the racial divide “more than forty years after the riot in 1967 blacks in the city of detroit still rely on whiteowned employer firms for jobs despite residence in an overwhelmingly black city” then with the kirwan institute at ohio state university john powell sic once described the “solution” to detroit’s structural problems of race and poverty as “promoting an equitybased regional agenda in an undercapitalized city” he advised detroit’s leaders toward “proactive policymaking that gives all people access to neighborhood resources connections to opportunityrich areas throughout the region and a voice in the future of their communities”

unlike the bailout of the auto companies national policymakers are not going to be able to tell taxpayers that capitalizing an undercapitalized detroit will yield the kind of returns and actual profits that they got from taking an ownership position in general motors rather this is reinvestment in detroit to rebuild a city to give hundreds of thousands of people a path toward opportunity to realize the potential in a “new economy” detroita networked entrepreneurial detroit—the reinvestment in the city needs to be undertaken because it must be done not because of the anticipated upside of public coownership of the chevy volt or gmc sierra

nonprofit service providers governor rick snyder and emergency manager orr assured detroiters that everything would continue as before just like normal regardless of the bankruptcy filing garbage would be picked up police would respond to calls and so forth that is a fine sentiment except that normal for detroit is a matter of extreme turbulence for detroiters city agencies and nonprofit service providers the average police response time in detroit is 58 minutes compared to 11 minutes nationally with the variation among precincts ranging from a fast response time of 31 minutes to a slow time of 115 minutes the heirs to axel foley’s police department solve only 87 percent of their cases compared to a 305 percent statewide average according to the bankruptcy filing forty percent of detroit streetlights do not work leaving the city with less than half as many working streetlights per square mile as cleveland or st louis the number of active public parks in the city is down to 107 from 317 in 2008 and 50 of the active parks are slated to be closed
in their huge commitment to continue offering services and meeting demands as the city’s public infrastructure crumbled nonprofits have tended to put the best face on detroit’s plunge into the financial abyss they continue to do so even in the wake of the bankruptcy filing the wall street journal quoted marian noland of the community foundation of southeast michigan as suggesting that the bankruptcy filing might be a turning point “moment where maybe detroit can start to move forward” responding to the bankruptcy bruce katz and jennifer bradley of the brookings institution described a number of nonprofit initiatives such as midtown detroit’s anchor institution development strategy the publicprivate partnership to build the 33 mile m1 light rail line and the 100 million investment of a consortium of philanthropies in the new economy initiative with a similar kind of confidence about the role of nonprofits and foundations

national policy responses in 1975 as new york city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy the new york daily news printed the iconic headline “ford to city drop dead” now detroit is the largest city ever to declare bankruptcy twice the size of stockton california which was the largest until last week what will be the message from the current president although president obama famously intervened to save general motors because he “refused to let detroit go bankrupt” he hasn’t quite made the same commitment to the city’s current financial predicament rather according to politico “president barack obama is monitoring detroit’s municipal bankruptcy…but has not committed any federal help for the beleaguered city” politico pointed out that the white house’s position contrasts with the democrats’ position in the 2012 campaign—that mitt romney’s opposition to the car manufacturer bailout was essentially saying “let detroit go bankrupt” reportedly kevyn orr strongly lobbied obama advisor valerie jarrett and left frustrated according to the detroit free press with “the white house’s lack of engagement”

the reality is that public policy toward cities like detroit is virtually nonexistent right after the bankruptcy announcement vice president joe biden admitted with typical candor that the obama administration really didn’t know what it could do to help detroit at this point writing for the washington post dan balz suggested that biden’s “don’t know” comment reflected an urban policy with “neither the political will nor the financial wherewithal”

the issue however isn’t just the lack of an urban policy it is america’s stillpersistent racial segregation a long story in largelyblack detroit surrounded by white suburbs and the nation’s increasing economic segregation former secretary of labor robert reich described detroit’s situation in terms that apply to many other metropolitan areas
“americans are segregating by income more than ever before forty years ago most cities including detroit had a mixture of wealthy middleclass and poor residents now each income group tends to lives separately in its own city—with its own tax bases and philanthropies that support at one extreme excellent schools resplendent parks rapidresponse security efficient transportation and other firstrate services or at the opposite extreme terrible schools dilapidated parks high crime and thirdrate services”

foundations have played a large role in capitalizing many of the initiatives that katz and bradley listed as promising strategies that might lead to a new detroit capital investments like the kresge foundation’s 150 million to the implementation of the detroit future city plan will almost automatically attract ideas that nonprofits and foundations can carry a large portion of the social and financial fix that detroit needs this is where nonprofits have to get a seat at the table to help design detroit’s path out of not only bankruptcy but also its decadeslong plunge taxexempt capital cannot in any conceivable scenario be expected to save detroit the solution requires a federal commitment not simply to detroit’s finances but to the socioeconomic divides in the metropolitan region that have pushed wealth and assets outside of the city limits

they must also make sure that the entities speaking for “nonprofit detroit” are not simply the interests of big universities and hospitals which can sometimes design their own walledoff trajectories the solution to detroit’s problems is going to be in the revitalization of its communities perhaps following the futures plan that kresge and others worked on for so many years that requires thinking about social inequities and racial inequities the path out of this morass for the motor city is not going to be simply charted on a spreadsheet but designed by the engagement and mobilization of those community residents who have stuck it out and committed to revitalizing neighborhoods like bostonedison bagley and some in midtown and southwestembed"
