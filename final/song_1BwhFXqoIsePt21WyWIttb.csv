hey i hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
calling my name and i follow just to find you
i trace the faith to a broken down television and put on the weather
and ive trained myself to give up on the past cause
i froze in time between hearses and caskets
lost control when i panicked at the acid test
i wanna get better

verse 2
while my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
i was losing my mind because the love the love the love the love the love
that i gave wasted on a nice face
in a blaze of fear i put a helmet on a helmet
counting seconds through the night and got carried away

prechorus
so now im standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
hey i wanna get better

chorus
i didnt know i was lonely til i saw your face
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better
i didnt know i was broken til i wanted to change
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better
see bleachers liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeverse 3
i go up to my room and theres girls on the ceiling
cut out their pictures and i chase that feeling
of an eighteen year old who didnt know what loss was
now im a stranger
and i miss the days of a life still permanent
mourn the years before i got carried away

prechorus
so now im staring at the interstate screaming at myself
hey i wanna get better

chorus
i didnt know i was lonely til i saw your face
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better
i didnt know i was broken til i wanted to change
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better

bridge
cause im sleeping in the back of a taxi
im screaming from my bedroom window
even if its gonna kill me

verse 4
woke up this morning early before my family
from this dream where she was trying to show me
how a life can move from the darkness
she said to get better
so i put a bullet where i shoulda put a helmet
and i crash my car cause i wanna get carried away
prechorus
thats why im standing on the overpass screaming at myself
hey i wanna get better

chorus
i didnt know i was lonely til i saw your face
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better
i didnt know i was broken til i wanted to change
i wanna get better better better better
i wanna get better43embed"
