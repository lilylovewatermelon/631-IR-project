yeah make sure my shit sound tight

verse 1
i never knew the world could be this mad
only vision i had of sex was color me badd
and i i never knew the world could be this cold
only time a nigga die he was playing a role
but now niggas get their souls stole so often
they only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
from ny to compton down to austin
she said that orphans morph into abortions without precaution
problem with our people theres too many wannabe jordan
too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin
too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
at least a bachelors but no too many wannabe rappers hah
thats just statistics dont mistake me for hypocrites
like niggas in the white house supplying witeout
on jim crow laws you probably missed it
hard to be persistent when youre tryin to fight for your existence

chorus
it aint easy livin life like this
when you tryin to be righteous but know a nigga might just
leave you lifeless for prices or high tech devices
so keep that tec9 or meet your crisis
yo it aint easy livin life like this
when you tryin to be righteous but know a nigga might just
leave you lifeless for prices or high tech devices
so keep that tec9 or meet your crisis

person mad nervous you surrender to sterling
look them in the eye if looks made you die you know you merk ‘em
right there plus his hide is like right here
so you know that if you would fight fair then youd have him like quite scared
but dont forget the tec held high by your right ear
so listen loud and clear you dont wanna lose your life dear
and don’t you show a slight tear or let em sight fear
just let em disappear in the night air yeah with yo nike airs
robbed by the crackheads left alone in the apartments
mothers be jobless so they make dollars shaking it topless and
daddy been gone said he took off like ostrich
since he gain knowledge i’m keeping it with the synopsis and
shit like that make you wish you were adopted
to escape the pain you join a gang and get intoxicated
have no shame nothing wrong with some mary jane
the only thing is you do it again and again and again and again
and again and again and again

chorus
it aint easy livin life like this
when you tryin to be righteous but know a nigga might just
leave you lifeless for prices or high tech devices
