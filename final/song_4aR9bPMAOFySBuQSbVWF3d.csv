when you first left me
i was wantin more
but you were fucking that girl next door
whatcha do that for whatcha do that for
when you first left me
i didnt know what to say say
i never been on my own that way
just sat by myself all day

prechorus
i was so lost back then
but with a little help from my friends
i found a light in the tunnel at the end
now youre calling me up on the phone
so you can have a little whine and a moan
and its only because youre feelin alone

chorus
at first when i see you cry
yeah it makes me smile
yeah it makes me smile
at worst i feel bad for a while
but then i just smile
i go ahead and smile
