whats wrong nigga
i thought you was keeping it gangsta
i thought this what you wanted
they say if you scared go to church
but remember he knows the bible too
chorus kendrick lamar
now baby when i get you get you get you get you
ima go hit the throttle with you
smoking lokin poking that doja til im idle with you
cause i want you
now baby when im riding here im riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking lokin drinking that potion you can see me swerving
cause i want you
i want you more than you know
verse 1 kendrick lamar
i remember you took me to the mall last week baby
you looked me in my eyes about four five times
til i was hypnotized then you clarified
that i want you
you said sherane aint got nothing on lucy
i said you crazy
roses are red violets are blue
but me and you both pushing up daisies if i want you

verse 2 kendrick lamar
you said to me you said your name was lucy
i said wheres ricardo
you said oh no not the show
then you spit a little rap to me like this
when i turned twentysix i was like oh shit
you said to me i remember what you said too you said
my name is lucy kendrick you introduced me kendrick
usually i don’t do this but i see you and me kendrick
lucy give you no worries lucy got million stories
about these rappers that i came after when they was boring
lucy gon fill your pockets
lucy gon move your mama out of compton
inside the gigantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty avoiding me
its not so easy im at these functions accordingly
kendrick lucy dont slack a minute lucy work harder
lucy gon call you even when lucy know you love your father
im lucy i loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
lucy dont mind cause at the end of the day youll pursue me
lucy go get it lucy not timid lucy up front
lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
i want you to know that lucy got you
all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible
chorus kendrick lamar
get you get you get you get you
ima go hit the throttle with you
smoking lokin poking that doja til im idle with you
cause i want you
now baby when im riding here im riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking lokin drinking that potion you can see me swerving
cause i want you

refrain bilal

poem
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin in the hotel room
i didnt wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin for answers
until i came home107embed"
