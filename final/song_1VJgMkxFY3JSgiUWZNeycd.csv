if youre coming with me
know i gotta make a move
sleeping by the freeways
looking for the things that i choose
i know i gotta go
i know i gotta see this through
im hoping that youll be there
hoping that you feel it too

verse 2
staring out the window
changing up my point of view
out across the border
fall into a daydream of you
but i dont wanna go
if you dont wanna go there too
and i dont wanna see it
if you dont wanna see this through

chorus
until the sun needs to rise
we sleep until the morning comes
so dont you open your eyes
til its dawn
until the sun needs to rise
we sleep until the morning comes
so dont you open your eyes
til its dawn

burning up beside me
fire in the ocean blue
leave it all behind me
nothing here to hold on to
i know i gotta go
i know i gotta see this through
im hoping that youll be there
hoping that you feel it too

until the sun needs to rise

until the sun needs to rise
we sleep until the morning comes
so dont you open your eyes

until the sun needs to rise
we sleep until the morning comes
so dont you open your eyes
til its dawn1embed"
