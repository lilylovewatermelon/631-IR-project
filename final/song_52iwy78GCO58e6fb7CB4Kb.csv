it aint fading
man i gotta let it out
am i crazy
screaming nothing ever comes out

i keep feeling lost
ill never find my way out
im not thanking them
unless the truth can pour out

give me some courage
beating me down now for some time
are you laughing am i funny
i hate inside i hate inside

chorus
ill take this time
to let out whats inside
‘cause i will break
sometimes i wish youd die

full of sorrow
you raped and stole my pride
and all this hate
is bottled up inside
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
my hearts breaking
man you really ripped it out
you take pleasure
watching as i claw my way out

the hurts rising
soon its gonna to tear my soul out
its not kosher
feeling like im on my way out

give me some courage
beating me down now for some time
are you laughing am i funny
i hate inside i hate inside

chorus
ill take this time
to let out what’s inside
‘cause i will break
sometimes i wish youd die

full of sorrow
you raped and stole my pride
and all this hate
is bottled up inside
brige
feeling the hate as they cut down my spine
peeling your flesh like the way youve cut mine
do you feel happy you fucked up my mind
youre going to pay this time

chorus
ill take this time
to let out whats inside
‘cause i will break
sometimes i wish youd die

full of sorrow
you raped and stole my pride
and all this hate
is bottled up inside

ill take this time
to let out whats inside
‘cause i will break
sometimes i wish youd die

full of sorrow
you raped and stole my pride
and all this hate
is bottled up inside2embed"
