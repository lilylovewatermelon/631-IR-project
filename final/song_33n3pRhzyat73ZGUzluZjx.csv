verse 1 adam lazzara fred mascherino
your famous last words started once your fingers hit the snooze
just nine more minutes please and they
they all know where to find me
every word that i said what a big mistake
and the ones you left out are keeping me awake
well i will never make another promise without you
i wont ever make another promise with you in mind

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
so pace the stairs to your apartment
like thats where you wanna be where you wanna be
thats where you wanna be where you wanna be

refrain adam lazzara fred mascherino
im sorry it took me so long
im sorry it took me so long to come around
im sorry it took me so long to come around
