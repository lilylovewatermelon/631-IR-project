no more gold lights
for the queen earth
to keep you warm
in your kingdoms

chorus
high on the waves
you make for us
but not since you left
have the waves come

verse 2
the bar is dead
and the rockets rain
is keeping you wet
in your deathbed

chorus
so high on the waves
you made for us
and not since you left
have the waves come

high on the waves
you made for us
not since you left
have the waves comeyou might also like2embed"
