i never can say goodbye

every time i think ive had enough
and start heading for the door
theres a very strange vibration
piercing me right to the core
it says turn around you fool
you know you love him more and more
tell me why is it so
dont want to let you go

hey i never can say goodbye boy
ooh baby i never can say goodbye no no no hey

i never can say goodbye oh no i
i never can say goodbye

i keep thinking that our problems
soon are all gonna work out
but theres that same unhappy feeling
and that anguish and that doubt
its that same old dizzy hangup
i cant do with you or without
tell me why is it so
i dont want to let you go

ooh baby i never can say goodbye no no no ooh
hey i never can say goodbye boy
ooh baby i never can say goodbye no no no no no no

hey i never can say goodbye boy
no no no baby hey i never can say goodbye no no no
please dont let me say goodbye
i just cannot say goodbyeembed"
