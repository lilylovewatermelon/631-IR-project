i am known
what what what what what what—

chorus the x files
i want to believe

verse 1 yung carecrow
bitchboy back up off me before you catch these hands
you in the pit dont give a shit and off a couple tabs
extend my fist and bust his lip fuck no i cant relax
put on my mask and rob the trap just so i can relapse
comin to end your fucking life
straight out the fire to terrorize
look in my eyes this yo demise fuckboys gonna die
straight out the wild bound for the mile
lick the mortified that devilish child with a crookedass smile
welcome to the night

chorus the x files
i want to believe

verse 2 shawty burnachurch
grey blade grey camo rag wrapped around my face
yung plague dodgin ammo animal instinct to erase
dragon ashing blunts in my fucking talons
grab em drag em to the fire let em burn up
we ignite em—
plague robbing graves lace blunts with fuckboy brains
plague up in flames let the ash rain ash king reigns
plague so fucking insane
dont touch my fucking lane
dont brush my fucking mane
go tuck your fucking chain
