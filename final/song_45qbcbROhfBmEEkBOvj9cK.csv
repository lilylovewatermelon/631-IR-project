like the white sand turns a clock hand in an hourglass
you’re the reason i believe in something i don’t know

you make it so you make it so
you make it so easy
this letting go is so beautiful
cause you make it so easy to fall so hard

like the ocean pulls the tide in just to hold it close
like the rain pour in a rainstorm makes the flowers grow
you’re the reason i believe in something i don’t know

you make it so you make it so
you make it so easy
this letting go is so beautiful
cause you make it so easy to fall so hard

woah oh
i fall so hard
woah oh

you make it so you make it so
you make it so easy

you make it so you make it so
you make it so easy
this letting go is so beautiful
cause you make it so easy

you make it so easy
to fall so hard
you make it so easy
