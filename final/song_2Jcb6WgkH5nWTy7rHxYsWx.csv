work like the devil for my pay
but that lucky old sun got nothin to do
but roll around heaven all day

fuss with my woman toil for my kids
sweat till im wrinkled and gray
while that lucky old sun got nothin to do
but roll around heaven all day

dear lord above cant you know im pining
tears all in my eyes
send down that cloud with a silver lining
lift me to paradise

show me that river take me across
wash my troubles away
like that lucky old sun gimme nothing to do
but roll around heaven all day

send down that cloud with a silver lining
lift me to paradise

show me that river take me across
wash all my troubles away
like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do
but roll around heaven all dayyou might also likeembed"
