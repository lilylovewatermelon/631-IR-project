we aint lovers no more
we dont laugh no more we dont play no more
we dont makeup no more
we dont kiss no more we dont hug no more
you dont please me no more
you dont touch no more give me chills no more
we dont go out no more
we dont kick it no more we dont dance no more

chorus
i remember walkin through the park walkin through the park
just shootin the breeze shootin the breeze
kissin in the shade shade those were the days
loungin in the den loungin in the den
you get breakfast in bed in bed
you let me have my way woah those were the days

verse 2
if you dont love me no more
dont come round no more just dont call no more
dont come knockin up at my door
after ten or so what you knockin for
we dont kick it no more
you aint cute no more you aint fly no more
you aint got it like that no more
see you close your door ill still remember you
