damn how ima say this shit
ay ay dad
yeah its your boy
you dont remember me
i wanna talk to you scrap
verse 1 beanie sigel
i remember being kicked out the house cause i looked just like you
said id be nothing but a crook—just like you
even niggas in the hood was shook or they just liked you
cause all they said was little whitey look im just like you
but dawg i cant see it at all shit
we never kicked it at all we never pitched or kicked at a ball
dawg you never taught me shit
how to fight ride a bike fixed a flat none of that sorts of shit
nigga you was an abusive pops fuck
you left me out to dry stuck
gotta teach news to box gotta teach news to block
and that aint the half of it man i gotta teach news the block
its about time we have a father to son nigga sit down
sit down let me tell you bout your fatherless sons
how they grew to be men and father they sons
father they daughters—nigga you left a fatherless daughter
i never follow your orders
nigga you make me sick pussy you could ooh
how you gon leave these memories in the back of my mind
i can see it clear as day you smacking my mom
i member that day you showed me that gat that 9
put it in my palm when i was young and said that would be mine
you turned me out the reason why i hit the block
reason why i tried to hit them cops
reason why i started hitting shots
reason why i started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court
gingerbread man never think of getting caught
look at your hands man—damn you fought
nigga you left my mom
left us with no goodbyes you left us out to dry
you left us with no letters notes no replies nothing
no digits numbers was unlisted
you left us with some of my loneliest nights
nigga some of my hungriest nights
shit one of the reasons for years shit embarrassing
damn we used to think money was white
yeah you gave us life like fruit from a plant
we aint eat right from them foods from them stamps
and to think you was my pop man i gotta stop shit

daddy where have you been
nigga you gon hear me out

verse 2 jayz
i wanted to walk just like you remember
wanted to talk just like you word
often momma said i look too much
and i thought just like you and id get happy
wanted to drink miller nips and smoke newports just like you
but you left me now im going to court just like you
i would say my daddy loves me and hell never go away
bullshit do you even remember decembers my birthday
do you even remember the tender boy
you turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan
get mommy out of some jam she was always in one
always short with the income always late with the rent
you said you was coming through i would stay in the hallway
always playing the bench waiting and that day came and went
fuck you very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
but im stronger and trust me i will never hurt again
would never ask mommy why daddy dont love me
why is we so poor why is life so ugly
mommy why is your eyes puffy
please dont cry everythingll be alright
i know its dark now but we gon see the light
its us against the world we dont need him right right
mommy driving 6s now yeah i got riches now yeah
i bought a nice home for both of my sisters now
we doing real good we dont miss you now
see how life twists around fucker
