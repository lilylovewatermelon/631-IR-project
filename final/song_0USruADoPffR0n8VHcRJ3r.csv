and there were future reflections
on the face and the hands
on a greencolored island
on a primitive man
it was the future reflecting
it felt familiar but new
a street was missing a building
the kids had something to do

chorus 1
there was a feeling the spirit was leaving
red like a marker
so my tribe with my knife
cut the heart from a lonely life

verse 2
i saw patterns on floorboards
deep in the dust was a leader
someone was walking on floorboards
turning from oak into cedar
he can assess the situation
i wrapped a string around my finger
into the forest with the young ones
i dont expect to be a winner
you might also likechorus 2
but as long as you feel it im a believer
my heart is phosphor
sea rolls and death tolls
break the surface dont break my bones
off of the trail and off of your hands and
onto a new plan
is the cost to stay lost
forever in an empty skin pale and thin

bridge
if its good or if its fortune i cant tell
but pieces come together for some reason just as well
their guns couldnt see us theres a sea outside my door
and one day ill appreciate the rush of blood and the washedout beat of the shore

outro
and remember what it felt like
to be alone
sitting in the sunlight
all alone7embed"
