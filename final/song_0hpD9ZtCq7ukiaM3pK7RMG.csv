yeah yeah

walking example of you
is wait for the silence
talking backwards to you
it meant nothing to me

watching the world fall on you
im keeping my eyes closed
now i can see what this means to you
it meant nothing to me

this wasted so many nights and again
ive wasted so much time on a friend
too young too proud to understand
so this is the end

perfect timing for you
youll run til your legs break
so heres my reminder of you
it meant nothing to me

this wasted so many nights and again
ive wasted so much time on a friend
too young too proud to understand
so this is the end

we shouldve seen this coming
we shouldve seen this

yeah yeah
yeah yeah

this wasted so many nights and again
ive wasted so much time on a friend
too young too proud to understand
so this is the end

yeah this is the endembed"
