there aint no wildlife left in tennessee
but i keep on living every song im singing
and theyre trying to put an end to guys like me
all thats left in bakersfield is a jukebox
and its haunted by old songs and memories
its getting hard to find a place to play my guitar
and theyre trying to put an end to guys like me

well id like to find a place where love surrounds me
some town where they dont mind me hanging around
a place where life dont move to fast
and what you are is not a thing of the past
where you can land your dreams on solid ground

well im sitting on a barstool down on broadway
waiting for my turn to sing my dreams
im just a california boy with my old guitar
and theyre trying to put an end to guys like me

well id like to find a place where love surrounds me
some town where they dont mind me hanging around
a place where life dont move to fast
and what you are is not a thing of the past
where you can land your dreams on solid ground
