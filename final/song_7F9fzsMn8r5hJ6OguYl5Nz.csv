spend the night
i never wanna think again
i never wanna see it when
the kids on the carpet have to go their separate ways
the heartache that theyre feelin has been filling up the place
if you never drink the poison then youre never gonna cry
if you dont believe in magic then you shouldnt even try

you look nice babe
dont think twice maybe
the world is a really scary place
but i know from the look thats on your face
your life has been over way before it all began
if you dont want to be lonely then i can be your man
i know that your mommys getting underneath your skin
but girl its all a fuckin joke so just live it while you canyou might also like2embed"
