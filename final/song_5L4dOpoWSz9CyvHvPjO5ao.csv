verse 1
she dances in his sheets at night
she dances to his needs
she dances til he feels just right
until he falls asleep
she dances at the crack of dawn
and quickly cooks his food
she cant be late cant take too long
the kids must get to school

chorus
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love

she dances for the man at work
who works her overtime
she cant be rude as she says
sir i must be home tonight
she dances to the kitchen stove
dinner is served by nine
he says his foods an hour late
she must be outta her mind

chorus
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love
but shes a slave to the rhythm

but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love

bridge
she works so hard just to make her way
for the man who just dont appreciate
and though he takes her love in vain
still she could not stop couldnt break his chains
verse 3
she danced the night that they fell out
she swore shed dance no more
but dance she did she dared not quit
as she ran out the door
she danced through the night in fear of her life
she danced to a beat of her own
she let out a cry and swallowed her pride
she knew she was needed back home home

chorus
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love
but shes a slave to the rhythm
but shes a slave to the rhythm of
but shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
the rhythm of love the rhythm of love1embed"
