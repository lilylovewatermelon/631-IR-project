theres a line of trucks pullin up in the driveway
barefoot tan legs swinging off tailgates
everybody knows everybody in town
when you call a couple friends man word gets around
got two tan yetis wont last all night
so if were gonna do this right

chorus
we gonna need more beer gonna need more ice
gonna need more cups stack em up to the sky
gonna need more crank on the knob on the radio
if tonights gonna go like i think its gonna go
one things clear
by the looks of the crowd in here
we gonna need more beer

verse 2
we got flip cups drying up empty on the table
beer pong switching over to black labеl
shot gun shot gun chugga chugga chug
double fisting trying to cut a rug rug rug
gotta restock cause man it hurts mе
seeing party people have to party thirsty nah

chorus
we gonna need more beer gonna need more ice
gonna need more cups stack em up to the sky
gonna need more crank on the knob on the radio
if tonights gonna go like i think its gonna go
one things clear
by the looks of the crowd in here
