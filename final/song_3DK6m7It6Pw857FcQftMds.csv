iiii did it alright alright i admit it

split and go where back to wearing knockoffs

lets talk over mai tais waitress top it off
hoes like vultures wanna fly in your freddy loafers
you cant blame em they aint never seen versace sofas
every bag every blouse every bracelet
comes with a price tag baby face it
you should leave if you cant accept the basics
plenty hoes in the ballernigga matrix
invisibly set the rolex is faceless
im just young rich and tasteless p

verse 3 kanye west
never was much of a romantic
i could never take the intimacy
and i know i did damage
cause the look in your eyes is killing me
i guess you knew of that advantage
cause you could blame me for everything
and i dont know how ima manage
if one day you just up and leave
