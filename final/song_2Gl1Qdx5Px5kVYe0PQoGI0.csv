i gotta be above it
gotta be above it
gotta be above it

verse
and i know that i gotta be above it now
and i know that i cant let them bring me down
and i gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
and i know that i gotta be above it now
and i know that i gotta be above it now
and i gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
i know that i gotta be above it now
and i cant let them all just bring me down

chorus
this time im just gonna take it
or im never gonna shake it
ill just close my eyes and make it so that
all those little things dont affect me now
