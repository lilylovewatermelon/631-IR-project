verse 1 childish gambino
when the world was discerned with this and that
i was young didnt know to hold it back
now we here and the world is something else
we could leave any day and call for help
we were gods nobody was above me woo
that a on my chest like adultery yeah
that a on my chest put your fist up yeah
that a on my chest like a chipmunk
alvin theodore
breathe in breathe out mi amor
breathe in breathe out never mind
it was time number nine
lllies feline with a death wish
eatin right didnt help shit
no name on the guest list
hold on we were destined

chorus azealia banks  childish gambino

maybe it’s the last night fireworks
maybe it’s the last night oh oh all the stars
maybe it’s the last night supermoon
maybe its the last night

verse 2 childish gambino
yeah break free from all of the insides
the godless denied us
but we dont give a damn bout the next day
we were never here never know if the world change
common sense the consequences
retweet the truth then regret the mentions
we are the wireless survivors of things gone
slaves to the unnamed never live long
live and die by the line never know fear
even i wont survive is it unfair
is it unfair cause i dont care
when i step on that ant on the grass
progress only thing thatll last last last
3005 the year that we fear only god will survive
to be alone is alive
