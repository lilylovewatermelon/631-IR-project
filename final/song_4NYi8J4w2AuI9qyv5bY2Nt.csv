sun comes up on this new morning
shifting shadows a songbird sings
and if these words could keep you happy
id do anything
and if you feel alone ill be your shoulder
with a tender touch you know so well
somebody once said its the soul that matters
but baby who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

chorus
and maybe the walls will tumble
and the sun may refuse to shine
but when i say i love you
baby you gotta know thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time

verse 2
moon shines down on this good evening
one warm kiss in the cold night air
and for this good love im receiving
id go anywhere just as long as you were there

chorus
and maybe the walls will tumble
and the sun may refuse to shine
when i say i love you
baby you gotta know thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time
you might also likebridge
oh and on these quiet days
where souls embrace so silently
oh the rain may wash away
all these words that young lovers say

chorus
and maybe the walls will crumble
and the sun may refuse to shine
but when i say i need you
baby you gotta know thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time

outro
say that youll never go thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time
baby you gotta know thats for all time
thats for all time
thats for all time
say that youll never go thats for all time
baby youll never go thats for all time4embed"
