everybody sees me but its not that easy
standing in the light field standing in the light field
waiting for some action waiting for some action over
why wont you come over here

refrain
why wont you come over here
we got a city to love
why wont you come over here
we got a city to love

prechorus
old time grudges
will die so slowly
i know you miss the
way i saw you

chorus
youre cold youre so cold
youre so cold youre so cold

verse 2
nobody can see me everything is too easy
standing in the light field standing in the light field
waiting for some actress waiting for some actress to say
why wont you come over here
