talk to me now im older
your friend told you cause i told her
friday nights have been lonely
change your plans and then phone me

verse 2
we could go and get forties
fuck going to that party
oh really your folks are away now
alright lets go you convinced me

chorus
1251 is the time my voice
found the words i sought
is it this stage i want
the world is shutting out for us
oh we were tense for sure
but we was confident

verse 3
kiss me now that im older
i wont try to control you
friday nights have been lonely
take it slow but dont warn me
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeoutro

oh really your folks are away now
alright im coming ill be right there22embed"
