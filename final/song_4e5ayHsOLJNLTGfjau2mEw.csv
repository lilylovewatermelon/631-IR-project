new to town with a madeup name
in the angels city chasin fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
so overnight you look like a 60s queen

prechorus
another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky

chorus
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
but can you tell me now youre the lucky one
oh oh oh

verse 2
and now its big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that youre lucky but youre so confused
cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place

another name goes up in lights
you wonder if youll make it out alive

chorus
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
can you tell me now youre the lucky one
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

verse 3
it was a few years later i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time but i understand it now

prechorus
cause now my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right

chorus
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
oh oh oh
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
oh oh oh
