remember when we were lost at sea
we would look at the bright night sky
thinking of what we could be
of what we could be
how to spend our lives
remember when we had nothing left
we were strung out in the cold
holding on trying to save our breath
trying to save our breath
we would not let go
whoa
through the good through the bad and ugly
whoa
well conquer anything

chorus
cause one day were gonna come back
and laugh at it all
one day well look at the past
with love love
one day were gonna come back
and relive those thoughts
one day well look at the past
with love love
with love love

remember down in the forest heart
we were lost losing hope and faith
we put our trust in counting stars
we were counting stars
trying to find our way
remember up on the mountain top
looking out on the rocks below
thanking god will we never stop
we will never stop
no we wont let go

chorus
cause one day were gonna come back
and laugh at it all
one day well look at the past
with love love
one day were gonna come back
and relive those thoughts
one day well look at the past
with love love
with love love

bridge
like a scene from the past
where we look back and laugh
with love love
a thought like a flash
black and white hope it lasts
with love love
like a scene from the past
where we look back and laugh
with love love
a thought like a flash
black and white hope it lasts
with love
chorus
cause one day were gonna come back
and laugh at it all
one day well look at the past
with love love
one day were gonna come back
and relive those thoughts
one day well look at the past
with love love
with love love
