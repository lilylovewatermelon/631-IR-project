hmm
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh ooh

verse 1
yeah i feel im watered down
whenever hes around
i put on the crown of clowns
and melt slowly to the ground
yeah i feel it coming on
when ive been static for too long
and an explosion comes in time
before i go and cross the line
they say you used to be so kind
i never knew you had such a dirty mind

prechorus
well i went to the doctors believing
the devil had control over me and
i was finding it hard to breathe and
finding it hard to fight the feeling

chorus
when my heart just burst like a glass balloon
i let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
i was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
i broke my glass balloon
i let go of my glass balloon

verse 2
they call him hermit the frog
hes looking for a dog
did you find your bitch in me
oh youre abominable socially
youre just a little bit too much like me
she says she used to be so kind
well baby i give you your dirty mind

prechorus
well i i wanna tell you a secret
you can take your doublestandard love and keep it
i cant help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
and i cant help he sometimes likes to come and rest his little head

chorus
when my heart just burst like a glass balloon
i let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
i was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
i broke my glass balloon
i let go of my glass balloon
oh my heart just burst like a glass balloon
we let them fly too high and they shatter too soon
are we the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room
we broke our glass balloons
we let go of our glass balloons
outro
we broke our glass balloon
let go of my glass balloon39embed"
