look at me my depth perception must be off again
cause this hurts deeper than i thought it did
it has not healed with time
it just shot down my spine
you look so beautiful tonight
remind me how you laid us down
and gently smiled before you destroyed my life

chorus
would you find it in your heart
to make this go away
and let me rest in pieces
would you find it in your heart
to make this go away
and let me rest in pieces

verse 2
look at me my depth perception must be off again
you got much closer than i thought you did
im in your reach
you held me in your hands
