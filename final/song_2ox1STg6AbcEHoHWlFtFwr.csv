love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right back down to size
sleep the day let it fade
who was there to take your place
no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down

chorus
cause i dont want to come back down from this cloud
its taken me all this time to find out what i need again
i dont want to come back down from this cloud
its taken me all this all this time

verse 2
there is no blame only shame
when you beg you just complain
the more i come the more i try
all police are paranoid
so am i sos the future
so are you be a creature
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down
