play me down my lover
like were undercover
like were in our freshmen year
like all the girls and boys in school
our anticipation
and our bad behaving
its like we learned our lesson
but conveniently forgot the rules

chorus
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that

verse 2
i dont want your lover
like my younger brother
hes patronized another
but i think its serious this time
i dont want you fading
acting like you hate me
its just like all your paper cuts
that cut you in the coldest spots
you might also likechorus
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that

bridge
fuck all the rest
and forget the rules
like all the girls and boys in my school
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
i said to this end dont hurt your best friend
keep playing along again
i said to this end dont hurt your best friend
keep playing along again
i said to this end dont hurt your best friend
keep playing along again
i said to this end dont hurt your best friend
keep playing along again

chorus
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
fuck all the rest
and forget the rules
like all the girls and boys in my school
questions for questions
ive got a question
would you ever dance with me like that
would you ever would you ever
would you ever would you ever
keep playing along againembed"
