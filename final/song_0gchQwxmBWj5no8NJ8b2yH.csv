my secrets are burning a hole through my heart
and my bones catch a fever
when it cuts you up this deep
its hard to find a way to breathe

prechorus
your eyes are swallowing me
mirrors start to whisper shadows start to sing
my skins smothering me
help me find a way to breathe

chorus
time stood still the way it did before
its like im sleepwalking
fell into another hole again
its like im sleepwalking

verse 2
im at the edge of the world
where do i go from here do i disappear
edge of the world
should i sink or swim or simply disappear

prechorus
your eyes are swallowing me
mirrors start to whisper shadows start to sing
my skins smothering me
help me find a way to breathe sing it

wake up
take my hand and give me a reason to start again
wake up
pull me out and give me a reason to start again

time stands still time stands still

my skin is smothering me
help me find a way to breathe
