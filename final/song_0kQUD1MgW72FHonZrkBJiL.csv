dont worry about the world outside

she and i agree
she and i lead a perfectly normal life
ah but just because we arent often seen socially
people think weve got something to hide
but all our friends know were just a little old fashioned
she and i

oh aint that great
aint it fine
to have a love someone that others cant find
aint it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us
she and i
so wonderful
she and i

she and i share with every body else
the same wants needs and desires
she and i save
she and i pay on everything we acquire

ah but just because we arent often seen separately
people think we live one life
see alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeits hard for them to see how anyone could be as close as
she and iembed"
