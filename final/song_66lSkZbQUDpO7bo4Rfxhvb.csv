say i dont look much like a lover
doesnt mean that i wont try
to set your world on fire every once in a while
we lie on the kitchen floor
hot air rises and its going to be hot as hell here soon

the best that i can

the road goes as far as the eye can see
i wont stand in your way whats the good in that
and the flowers in their bed
theyre drooping and dying and fading away
this weathers no good for growing things

sick of leaving things halfdone leaving things halfsaid
