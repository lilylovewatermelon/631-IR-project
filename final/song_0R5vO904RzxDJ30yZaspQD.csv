magnolia
she could have anyone in the world
floats around town in a golden gown
born in a castle on a cloud

magnolia
prettiest girl that i know
stars in her eyes
handpicked from the skies
beautiful soul

chorus
how can i compete with her
perfection is the only word
i think of when i think of magnolia
she doesnt know that the world is turning just for her
i wish i could be magnolia

verse 2
magnolia
she can move oceans and rivers with ease
a word from her lips
her sirens kiss
will send you straight into abyss
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likemagnolia
i wish shed give her secrets away
enchants еveryone
and i think itd be fun
to bе like her someday

chorus
but i cannot compete with her
perfection is the only word
i think of when i think of magnolia
she doesnt know that the world is turning just for her
i wish i could be magnolia
