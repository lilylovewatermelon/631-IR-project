she doesnt know that shes mine so ill give her some time
and every single thing about her is nearly flawless
but were only friends when she gives me the time

but when i try to hide the way i feel inside
i get so lost in the thought of what its like to be alive
seeing the same moon you see out your window
so i will sing the songs that only you have heard
on top my cursed bed that in time
you swore became the only place you dreaded leaving

im not going anywhere
im not going anywhere until i see you
smile
im not going anywhere
im not going anywhere until i see youyou might also like1embed"
