whats up make love

verse 1
ragweed tall better hope that his ladder dont crack
or hell hit the ground low hard and under his back
at the battle at the bottom of the ocean where the dead do rise
you need proof i got proof at the surface
you can watch em float by

verse 2
way in back of the room there sits a cage
inside is the clock that you can win if you can guess its age
which you never can do cause the time it constantly changes
for lack or luck i guess that is the saying

outro
on the first page of the book of blue it read
if you read this page then thatll be your death
by then it was too late and you wound up on
an island of shells and bones that bodies had left
and the one thing you taught me bout human beings was this
they aint made of nothin but water and shit
