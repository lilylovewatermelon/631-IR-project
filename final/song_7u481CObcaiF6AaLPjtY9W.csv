theres satellite communications
long distance internet relations
the worlds a little faster every day
now i know its all well and good
and i dont embrace it like i should
but i wouldnt wanna go backwards even if i could
but

chorus
i still like bologna on white bread now and then
and the sound of a whippoorwill down a country road
the grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
and a good womans love to hold me close

verse 2
i like my 50 inch hd plasma
feels like they just reach out and grab you
500 channels at my command
i finally gave in and got a cell phone
that i hardly ever seem to turn on
i guess i never had that much to say
and

chorus
i still like bologna on white bread now and then
and the sound of a whippoorwill down a country road
the grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
and a good womans love to hold me close
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
i got a laptop that sits on a desk
i dont use it much except to check on
some old car from yesterday
i kind of like that music thing
you just download them
and you can save about every song
thats ever been made
but

chorus
i still like bologna on white bread now and then
and the sound of a shovel head down a gravel road
the grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
and a good womans love to hold me close

verse 4
well i guess what ive been trying to say
this digital world is okay
it makes life better in a lot of ways
but it cant make the smell of spring
or sunshine or lots of little things
we take for granted every day
oh and

chorus
i still like bologna on white bread now and then
and the sound of a whippoorwill down a country road
the grass between my toes and that sunset sinking low
and a good womans love to hold me close
outro
yeah bologna a womans love and a good cell phoneembed"
