hey mrs grey are you awake yet
your beauty sleep is just a dream
those lines on your face
they tell your story
so now its time for laser beams

chorus
ah look at you
a thousand miles above the ground
youre not coming down
ah what a view
you drift about youre spinning round
youre not coming down

verse 2
hey mr blue you feeling randy
do you still flirt with her next door
wearing that dress
nicked from your mother
it doesnt fit you anymore

chorus
ah look at you
a thousand miles above the ground
youre not coming down
ah what a view
you drift about youre spinning round
youre not coming down

chorus
ah look at you
a thousand miles above the ground
youre not coming down
ah what a view
you drift about youre spinning round
youre not coming down
