with all the kissin the touchin the bitin the tuggin
you know you know i love what you do
you know i know i love what you do
and all the spittin the cursin the fightin and fussin
you know im only fuckin with you
i bet you i was only thinkin if i
if i could id take you everywhere
but you know i cant do nothin with you
you know i cant do nothin with you
you know i never looked as good as i do and its the truth
no bullshit im nothin without you

verse 1 anderson paak
say i should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
i dont need it ima slang this bitch and take ya shoppin
cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces
i would rather have no feelings than cryin and sobbin
when i met you i was broke as the rope on the faucet
i had dreams that i would blow like a nintendo cartridge
i was hungry i was dirty i needed a shower
said you fed me and you clothed me you packed me a sack lunch
papa said when i get older get a girl like your momma
but im twenty cough years old and runnin out of options
how im supposed to trust ya
aint you one of them ones tryin to run up
pose for the perfect picture upload and post it
question is you with me or not
im from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
but im used to having cyclones blown in and out of my life
so its no biggie if you need time to figure it out

verse 2 rapsody
you know you wrong shit you out of pocket
remember you was couch surfin you aint have a casa
and mi casa i would buy you shoes from out the locker
even though i heard around the town from all the gossip
between they legs and slidin limousines in garages
heard your mama cheated on ya daddy you just like her
karma come around remember what happened to tiger
game over dead wrong uh biggie wallace
i was the one you counted on before you stacked your wallets
talkin bout me motherfucker you the one with problems
haha you played yourself for a photo uh that you aint know though
i only took from niggas trying to slide up in the dm
and show em i was happy with the nigga i was seein
but you fucked up stupid so i guess ill go and see em
as you contemplate how to get me back like liam
no fuckin tonight ill be gone by the pm nigga
chorus anderson paak
