ooh
ooh

verse 1
school bell rings walk me home
sidewalk chalk covered in snow
lost my gloves you give me one
wanna hang out yeah sounds like fun
video games you pass me a note
sleeping in tents

chorus
its nice to have a friend ooh
its nice to have a friend ooh

verse 2
light pink sky up on the roof
sun sinks down no curfew
twenty questions we tell the truth
youve been stressed out lately yeah me too
something gave you the nerve
to touch my hand

chorus
its nice to have a friend ooh
its nice to have a friend ooh
