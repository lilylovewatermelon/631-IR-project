verse 1 spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
im a halfwit boy
cracking a smile and wearing it all on my sleeve
so cool and so poised
its true im just around to see
where this thing goes ill never know
but all i know is packing bags is a remedy is a remedy

chorus spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
this time ill be nervous
cause i cant see your hands in front of me in front of me tonight
lets forget all pretense of what they thought we should be
what liars we can be

im on my way to the top of the world
and ive got a feeling ill give it away

verse 2 spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
shes a maverick shes so smooth
if things go according to plan
ill have her finished by five am
theres no changing plans theres no second chance
ive already got both feet through the door
and i can taste the air i can taste the air
