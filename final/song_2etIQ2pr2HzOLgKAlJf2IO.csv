i have to let my ego go
my profit coming heavy as it grows and im almost near the point where i’m about to lose control
and if he never burdens us with more then we can hold then why do i implode like a fucking over load
i got fire on my head like mj with a pepsi drink and a lot of shit inside me like a septic tank
its funny niggas wanna spin around and flip shit like i never been shit but a fucked up misfit
and while theres truth to those accusations
i’m still sick with no motherfucking vaccination
i’m still the shit like they pressed pause on me
and technically i foul til’ the ref calls on me
nigga i could have been signed… i been a buzz
but i was scared to show the world who i really was
and label heads they ignore those who give their all cause they’re busy seeing what stick when its to the wall
it ain’t about the fucking craft and perfection
ask ryan leslie i was fucking that selection
but i was busy being stubborn as a bastard with the mind of a crafter and a father that was casper
so i got a lot of shit i won’t admit
and a whole bunch more that i won’t forget
these fucking faggots wanna trap me in my baggage
andttreat me like i’m manic cause i’m more then they can manage
bitch but imma be me til’ i fucking croak
and i won’t let you take me as a fucking joke
so don’t compare me to any bitches that’s out here
cause be honest i am who they not near
bitch i’m higher then the fucking feeling
higher then a building that was built on heavens ceiling
i cant believe i chose this bullshit over books
i’m like a midget in a crowd being overlooked
and niggas still fucking fail to acknowledge me
sleeping on me then later offering apologies
i’m sorry raee’n you speak the truth with every fucking word
shut up bitch tell me something that i haven’t heard
don’t deny you play your favorite rapper then play me
after you would swear i flow like the middle of a fucking rapture
my mind set is kill em’ all or be destroyed
i’m out here trying to be balling bigger then keloid
yeah i gotta eat fuck whoever starving
its survival of the fittest word to that nigga darwin
pause i’m done letting niggas play me
and dying of laughter is the only way that they slay me
cause i’ve been standing here naked hoping y’all see
i’m trying to take your eyes and make em’ focus on me
my mom told me raee’n you’ll only be a star when you become comfortable with who you really are
and since i did niggas been trying to manipulate me break me and shape me to every image that they see
but i dont listen to a word from you fucking beginners
bitch i’m flyer then the south for a couple of winters
how dare you niggas try to call me influential
in the same fucking sentence say its all coincidental
she dresses like a dyke but she bodies instrumentals
i think she’s fucking faking it  its all so incidental
nigga i had to kill myself 3 times
and let the neigh sayers brain cell my free mind
to hold it all in i ain’t got the room to
so i don’t entertain the bullshit that i’m immune to
fuck you all bitch fags you can die slow
let me be great its the only thing i know
i learned young not to trust shit
so i’m sorry to the world if i’m not enough bitch
fuck it all i have is my word and my pride
so i exhale and let all my burdens subside
and to my haters yall bitches stay tune imma give you all a million reasons to hate you
and still i did it all on my fucking own
now i’m about to change the chair into a fucking throne
and i dare anybody to stop me
i’m putting bitches in the dirt like sock cleats
im doneyou might also likeembed"
