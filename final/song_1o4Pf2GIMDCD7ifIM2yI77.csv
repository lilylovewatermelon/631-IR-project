she just walked away
why didnt she tell me
and where do i go tonight
this isnt happening to me
this cant be happening to me
she didnt say a word
just walked away

chorus
you were the first to say
that we were not okay
you were the first to lie
when we were not alright
this was my first love
she was the first to go
and when she left me for you
i was the last to know

verse 2
