im searching for something that i cant reach

verse 1
i dont like them innocent i dont want no face fresh
want them wearing leather begging let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes bad guys mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor but quick to tell me goodbye

prechorus
you say that youre no good for me
cause im always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

chorus
my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost whered you go
what happened to the soul that you used to be

verse 2
youre a rolling stone boy neversleepalone boy
got a million numbers and theyre filling up your phone boy
im off the deep end sleeping all night through the weekend
saying that i love him but i know im gonna leave him
