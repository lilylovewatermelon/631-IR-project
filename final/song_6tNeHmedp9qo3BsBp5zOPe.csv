there was a time looking through myself
wanting to pretend
if i escaped i could fill myself
i dont think you can
been far and wide
but that hole inside
never really leaves
when i went away what i really left
left behind was me

prechorus 1
its telling me
to be on my way
home

chorus
ohohoh ohohoh
million miles away
ohohoh ohohoh
million miles away
i cant stay i cant stay
ohohoh ohohoh
a million miles away

verse 2
each passing day every passing face
seems like such a blur
i long to be home silently
lying next to her
just to get back by her side is all
all i need to be
i went away but what i really left
left behind was me

getting on my way
home
