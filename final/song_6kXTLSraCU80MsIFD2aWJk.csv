sometimes they look brown
sometimes they look blue
always they offer a beautiful view
into the soul im connected to
no one has eyes like you
they dance in the light
they sing in the dark
they pull me together
they tear me apart
im jealous of paper when you read the news
oh no one has eyes like you

chorus
they hold me they know me
like no one will ever know me
they fly me
they land me
most of all they understand me

verse 2
they shout hallelujah when you whisper my name
patiently listen to whatever i say
theyre playful and funny
and passionate too
no one has eyes like you

they hold me they know me
like no one will ever know me
they fly me
they land me
most of all they understand me

outro
they smile when im happy
they cry when im sad
they make me out to be more than i am
oh no one loves me more than you do
and no one has eyes like you
oh no one has eyes baby like you1embed"
