verse 1
ayo ma how you doin its your son now
and i picked up the mic and put the drugs down
now im tryin to do some things thatll make you proud
instead of every time i call its to bail me out
oh why didnt i listen to things you used to tell me
knowin that everything that you said would never fail me
like they got plans for ya aint nothin i can do
when them laws get they hands on you but i aint listenin
even payin attention im just tryna get mine
takin advantage you workin two jobs at the same time
ungrateful complainin about nike and polo signs
but you always come through and what do i do
i wreck both your cars stole money from your drawers
sold dope out your yard stayed into with them laws
tryin to pay you back for all the stress that i caused
and always be there to give you whatever you want
