she remembers the nights hed come calling
his yellow silk tie
in love she saw him falling for her in the fire of july
then one day as the nights grew longer
blackberry winter in a little white church
stood a young pretty bride

chorus
forever changed
forever changed
nothing ever stays the same
forever named
forever changed

verse 2
she remembers the change in her body
the blooming within
and how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
then one night as the days grew longer
that indian summer
she brought love into the world
cried and held me then

chorus
forever changed
forever changed
nothing ever stays the same
forever child
forever changed
ooh mmm

some days shell talk about aunt rosie
the sister she lost
asking when shes coming over
and why she hasnt called
some days i just hold her fragile hand
as time creeps cross the floor
some days it almost kills me
watching her memories slip away a little more

chorus
forever changed
forever changed
nothing ever stays the same
forever named
forever child
forever loved
