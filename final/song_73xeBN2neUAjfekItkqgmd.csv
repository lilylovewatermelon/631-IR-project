a man was bothering me today
and i wanted to tell him to go away
but i stood and listened to him anyway okay
he said he didnt wanna shoot that man
and it was his thing and i wouldnt understand
and he had done all that he can okay okay

verse 2
i guess his body was as good as mine
and just like me he was wasting time
turning every stone to see what he could find okay
he was filling tank and he asked for money
i lied and said i didnt have any
then my conscience took over and i gave him a hand full of change

chorus
dont do a thing dont do a thing
stay right there
youll lie there youll lie there
you dont seem to care
yeah

verse 3
i know its hard to survive in the city
when beautiful days dont look so pretty
and you dont have windows to keep the night away okay
he was dirty and stinky and just a bit crude
but i didnt say that cause thats kind of rude
and he didnt care what i had to say in the first place okay
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 4
i wanted to say youre a big disgrace
to the world yourself and the human race
and reach back and pop him one good time in the face okay
naw its not okay and i didnt do that
but i gave him a smile and tipped my hat
and told him to have a very nice rest of the day

chorus
dont do a thing dont do a thing
stay right there
youll lie there youll lie there
you dont seem to care
get em

verse 5
well i guess he bought some booze with it
and sure that bothers me a little bit
but its his life and i cant tell him how to live it thats right
as he turned and started to go his way
i tried to think of something wise to say like

chorus
dont do a thing dont do a thing
stay right there
youll die there youll die there
cause you dont seem to care
youll die there youll die there
you dont seem to careembed"
