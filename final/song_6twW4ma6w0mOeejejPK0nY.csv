verse 1 liam all harry
the front pages are your pictures they make you look so small
how could someone not miss you at all ohohoh
i never would mistreat ya no im not a criminal
i speak a different language but i still hear your call

diana let me be the one to
light a fire inside those eyes
youve been lonely you dont even know me
but i can feel you crying
diana let me be the one to
lift your heart up and save your life
i dont think you even realise
baby youd be saving mine
