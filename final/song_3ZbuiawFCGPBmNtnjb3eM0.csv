always be mommas baby always be daddys girl
right now shes makin em crazy
little red robin hood big bad world

chorus
she aint waitin on twentyone candles
she aint missin not a minutes of fun
she aint worried bout one day older
pretty little rebel on the run
she aint trying to be hard to handle
she gonna do what a girl gonna do
she aint waitin on twentyone candles
sure aint gonna wait on you

verse 2
cant be innocent forever aint never done anything
shell tell you no but she dont mean never
turned a corner when she turned eighteen

chorus
she aint waitin on twentyone candles
she aint missin not a minutes of fun
she aint worried bout one day older
pretty little rebel on the run
she aint trying to be hard to handle
she gonna do what a girl gonna do
she aint waitin on twentyone candles
sure aint gonna wait on you

chorus
she aint waitin on twentyone candles
she aint missin not a minutes of fun
she aint worried bout one day older
pretty little rebel on the run
she aint trying to be hard to handle
