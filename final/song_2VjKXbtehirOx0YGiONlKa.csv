daddy can you hear me can you see me can you free me
im shackled to your memory
am i everything that you thought id be
the day you laid your armor down and took your last breath just keeps replaying now
im doing my best to be strong for everyone around
but tonight im breaking down
thinking bout the lessons you taught you got your point across with the ways you talked
i watched you move mountains to me but then i watched you struggle to walk
and every day burns like the last one
hope you forgive me for the times i was a bad son
but lord you took my hero from me when you know i only had one

prechorus savannah dexter
that was my hеart you broke
that was my friend you stole
that was thе man that made me who i am
now you see this mask i wear
out in the suns despair
goodbye plans and i guess ill never understand

chorus savannah dexter
still my hero
still my hero
still my hero
still my hero
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 jelly roll
some days i sit and reminisce and i think of the past
how do we lose something we love and it just happens in a flash
its just the cycle of life i swear it happened so fast
you watched me take my first breath i watched you take your last
last night i couldnt sleep so i got up and took me a ride
i took a ride through antioch i smoked a joint and i cried
i watched you stare death in the face without a fear in your eyes
you taught me how i should live you taught me how i should die
wish i could have the strength you had as you laid there on that bed
staring at death i remember every word that you said
without a hint of bitterness you sat there shaking your head
laughing and telling stories about the life you had led
while you was alive is when we gave you flowers
you taught me love is the way a man stays in power
you taught me always be brave and stay away from cowards
i only wish that heaven had visitation hours
i cant lie me and my brothers weve been taking it hard
lately this is how it is conversations with god is like

prechorus savannah dexter
that was my heart you broke
that was my friend you stole
that was the man that made me who i am
now you see this mask i wear
out in the suns despair
goodbye plans and i guess ill never understand
chorus savannah dexter
still my hero
still my hero
still my hero
still my heroembed"
