is it raining at your house like its raining at mine
do you miss me like i miss you is it cloudy all the time
do you tremble when the phone rings and you think im on the line
is it raining at your house like its raining at mine

chorus
does it thunder and lightning even when the sun shines
is it raining at your house like its raining at mine

verse 2
is it raining at your place just like it is over here
if it is then sweetheart like me i know youre scared
i just called you to console you like any old friend would do
is it raining at your house and by the way i still love you

chorus
does it thunder and lightning even when the sun shines
is it raining at your house like its raining at mine
is it raining at your house like its raining at minesee brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeembed"
