one bull fight leads to another
if you gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother

song
feelin like superman
cold beer in my hand
ive been waitin all week long
johnny on the jukebox
jenny in the shadowbox
nothin but her lipstick on
shoot a little fireball
shoot a little nine ball
back against the back wall crowd
i dont need to smoke
but ill take another toke
cause tonight im burnin it down

step right up paid your little cover 
try to out drink a bunch a redneck mothers
one bud light leads to another
if youre gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother
gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeyonder come a plow boy
trash talkin cowboy
actin like hes ten feet tall
billys kissin ontrea
hell its just the first date
met her in the bathroom stall
cat on a tin roof
higher than the 90 proof
howlin like a bluetick hound
steady as the beer flows
everything in here goes
circus done come to town

yeah step right up paid your little cover
try to outdrink a bunch a redneck mothers
one bud light leads to another
if youre gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother
gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother

instrumental bridge

everything was goin fine
till i hit the moonshine
billy spilled a drink on me
shoulda known better
hell i knew better
but i rared back and took a swing
i said step right up paid your little cover
try to outdrink a bunch a redneck mothers
one bud light leads to another
if youre gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother
gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brother

outro
one bull fight leads to another
if you gonna fight billy
gonna have to fight his brotherembed"
