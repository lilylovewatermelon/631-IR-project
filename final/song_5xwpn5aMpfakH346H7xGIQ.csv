verse 1 project pat
roll up a blunt like light up the green
eyes red as fire im on promethazine
roll up another one dipped in the sizzurp
save it for later mane cause it wouldnt hizzurt
soon as the thunder enters my lungsah
i start gettin hungry wheres that bologna
crackers and cheese zuzus and whams
icy white honey bun ooohh there i am
go an light another one constantly smokin
turn up a 45 drankin and chokin
started smoking weed real young with my peers
so full of dope smoke comin out my ears
burnt fingernails aint made no sales
yall might be short an ounce or two on them scales
to hell with that fool go an take a pull
we cheefin all night and we stay gettin food

chorus project pat
smokin out like chief wahoo hoo
chase it down with the liquor and brew brew
pass it round thats the way we do do
somebody get this dope cause im through through
