too many people in this bar
i cant hear myself think over the guitar
i can tell that you wanna get outta here and disappear dont ya baby
too many lights on in the street
i can see the way that youre looking at me
and the way youre slipping off your jimmy choos like you wanted to since we got here
now were driving down the highway pulling into my place
got your hand over on my knee
now that were alone
im gonna let you know everything you mean to me

chorus
theres no such thing as too much money
cause if i had it all i would spend it on you honey
time on your hands baby i can take it off ya let me take it off ya
cause im love drunk
sipping on your kiss a little too much and i cant get enough
like too much shine in a diamond ring theres no such thing
there aint no such thing
there aint no such thing
there aint no such thing yeah

verse 2

as too many stars in the sky
too many hours in the night
