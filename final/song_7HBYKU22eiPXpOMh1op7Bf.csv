he had a plan to kill you all along
the evidence was hidden in this song
i was a ghost i was there at the scene
as the embers rise my hands smelled like gasoline

verse 2
so the head lights murdered my thoughts
i curse this taste thats on my tongue this taste will last until i rip it out
no i wont need these gloves
her bones are withered away but her ghost will remain

prechorus
youre the only one that wore your seatbelt were the only ones that cried
catastrophic accident youre the only one that died

chorus
so keep my casket closed
your heart beats under the floor
it haunts me in my dreams
and nothings as it seems

postchorus
hallelujah whoa

all the choices youve made and the paths that i take
