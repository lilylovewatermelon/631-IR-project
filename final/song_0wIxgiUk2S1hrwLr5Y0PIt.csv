i thought there was something wrong with my life
i thought i was hopeless thinking im out of time
and nothing could change it and nobody knew
i thought i was breaking and then i met you

chorus
oh my youre so fine cant write you out my mind
i like it when you lie to me i love it when you try to be
wild bitchy impolite somehow stuck in my sights
i like that youre not nice to me i love your heart of ice

postchorus
your heart of ice
your heart of i—

verse 2
you got a heart of ice
i love the way you dont even try
to hide the fact that you wеre never minе
oh my i wouldve never thought
wouldve never figured out your lock
but i tried and you were caught in a lie
but i wanna fall in love wanna mend my trust
wanna fuck my life again dont wanna fuck up
fuck with all these walls when they disguised as friends
ill never recognize the lies i fantasize inside my head
ill never get upset ill just forget let regret fester in cause

postchorus
your heart of ice
your heart of i—

bridge
i found part of me
from a place that you dont seem to see
where i can go to fall asleep again and
i know there seems to be too many thoughts for this to be
a dream i said the same thing to my friends
and i finally thought that you would take me out this spot
but no and now i hope to rid these thoughts
but i cant lie i know you know it hurts my eyes
to see you i love how you made me cry

chorus
oh my youre so fine cant write you out my mind
i like it when you lie to me i love it when you try to be
wild bitchy impolite somehow stuck in my sights
i like that youre not nice to me i love your heart of ice

your heart of ice
