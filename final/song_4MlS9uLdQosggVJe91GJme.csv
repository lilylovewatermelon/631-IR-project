out of balance out of options
ive been tryin for hours to weigh the possibilities
for you and me
what itd really take to truly be happy
sick of wishin holdin on to empty love ambitions
happily ever after seems like fiction
id be foolish if my faith aint slipping sadly

prechorus
get away from me
wish that i could hurt less
aint got time for your nonsense
dont wanna hear you speak
seeing you makes me nervous
cause i really believe we still deserve it
and maybe just maybe i was mistaken
maybe we could be perfect
maybe i was mistaken
maybe its really worth it
im not sure yet

chorus
runnin from my heart
hate to go so soon
this has to be the end
you wont see me again
the far side of the moon
runnin from my heart

so damn jaded
this uncertainty is so frustratin
i be up here mindin like im waitin
im too old for all these games we playin
im just sayin uh
you really think that youre the man
you out here runnin shit
you know you can
but i aint like these other women
no i i aint really fuckin with it

prechorus
get away from me
wish that i could hurt less
aint got time for your nonsense
dont wanna hear you speak
seeing you makes me nervous
cause i really believe we still deserve it
and maybe just maybe i was mistaken
maybe we could be perfect
maybe i was mistaken
maybe its really worth it
but until then

chorus
runnin from my heart
hate to go so soon hate to go
this has to be the end the end
you wont see me again oh
the far side of the moon
runnin from my heart
breakdown
im giving you my last goodbye
ooh im movin on
you can do no wrong
ooh but ill be long gone

chorus
runnin from my heart
hate to go so soon
this has to be the end
you wont see me again
the far side of the moon
runnin from my heart7embed"
