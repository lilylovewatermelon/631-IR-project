i drugged it in its sleep
there isnt many memories
im comfortable to keep
this ball keeps rolling on
its heading for the street
keep expecting you to send for me
the invitation never comes

each time i turn around
theres nothing there at all
so tell me why i feel like
im up against a wall
but maybe its a false alarm
and every answer sounds the same
just colours bleeding into one
that hasnt got a name
maybe i cant see
maybe its just me

now the curtains coming up
the audience is still
im struggling to cater for
the space im meant to fill
and distance doesnt care
no distance doesnt care
you might also likeeach time i turn around
theres nothing there at all
so tell me why i feel like
im up against a wall
but maybe its a false alarm
and every answer sounds the same
just colours bleeding into one
that hasnt got a name
maybe i cant see
maybe its just me

im trying to put this thing to bed
i drugged it in its sleep
remember what you said
are you comfortable to keep it
keep itembed"
