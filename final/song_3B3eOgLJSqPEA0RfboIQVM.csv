come on skinny love just last the year
pour a little salt we were never here
my my my my my my my my
staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
i tell my love to wreck it all
cut out all the ropes and let me fall
my my my my my my my my
right in this moment this orders tall

chorus
and i told you to be patient
and i told you to be fine
and i told you to be balanced
and i told you to be kind
and in the morning ill be with you
but it will be a different kind
and ill be holding all the tickets
and youll be owning all the fines

verse 2
come on skinny love what happened here
suckle on the hope in light brassieres
my my my my my my my my
sullen load is full so slow on the split
you might also likechorus
and i told you to be patient
and i told you to be fine
and i told you to be balanced
and i told you to be kind
and now all your love is wasted
and then who the hell was i
and im breaking at the britches
and at the end of all your lines

outro
who will love you
who will fight
who will fall far behind163embed"
