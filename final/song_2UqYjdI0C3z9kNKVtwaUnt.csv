spoken interlude lord have mercy
as we approach the current time frame of 1997
with approximately two and a half years before the year 2000
repeatedly it has been reported that there will be a time soon approaching
that a major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
it has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be approaching
in the form of many
many as in squad squad as in flipmode squad
it has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
but this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast
and will fuck up everything within its 360 degree radius
warning prepare yourselves store your food stack your paper
because when this motherfucker gets here its about to get real fucked up for everyone and everything
everywhere
