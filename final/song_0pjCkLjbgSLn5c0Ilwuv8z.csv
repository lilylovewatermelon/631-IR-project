throw me all around like a boomerang sky
whatever you do dont tell me why
poppies grow tall then say bye bye
the wave is here
a seamless little team and then we tanked
i guess were not so sacrosanct
the tip of my tongue but then we blanked
the wave is here
waiting on the wind to tell my side
ready set jet but she never gets far
listen to your skin from the seat of my car
two centipedes stuck in one glass jar
the longest wave
waiting on the wind to tell my side

prechorus
whatcha want
whatcha need
do you love

chorus
maybe im the right one maybe im the wrong
just another play the pirate and the papillon
time to call it a day
maybe youre my last love maybe youre my first
just another way to play inside the universe
now i know why we came
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gauge
under my skin and half my age
hotter than the wax on a saxifrage
the longest wave
waiting on the wind to turn my page
steady your sails for the butterfly flap
whatever you do dont close that gap
im dreaming of a woman but shes just my nap
your ship is in
waiting on the tide so i can swim

prechorus
whatcha want
whatcha need
do you love

chorus
maybe im the right one maybe im the wrong
just another play the pirate and the papillon
time to call it a day
maybe youre my last love maybe youre my first
just another way to play inside the universe
now i know why we came

outro
now i know why we came
