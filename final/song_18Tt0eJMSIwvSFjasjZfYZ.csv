other people prefer to walk through life where you might skip
and other people watch their step where you most likely trip
sure your hairs not perfect and there’s  whats that on your clothes
and yeah youre kinda talkative with freckles on your nose

chorus hans
but you’re you youre you
and thats what makes me smile
youre you youre you
so stay that way a while

spoken anna
oh hans i 

verse 2 hans
you dont have to say a thing i know the way you feel
your face is like an open book so honest truе and real
other peoplе lie and cheat when push may come to shove
your heart doesnt work like that
so youre the girl i love

chorus hans
you’re you you’re you
thats how i hope you stay
you’re you youre you

but anyway
thats all i got to sayembed"
