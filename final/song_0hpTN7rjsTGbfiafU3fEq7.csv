dont call it a comeback
ive been here for years
rockin my peers
putting suckers in fear
makin the tears rain down like a monsoon
listen to the bass go boom
explosion explosion overpowering
over the competition were towering
record shock when i drop these lyrics
thatll make you call them cops what
dont you dare stare you better move move
dont ever compare
us to the rest thatll all get sliced and diced
competition paying our price

starting a hurricane releasing pain
letting you know that you cant gain or maintain
