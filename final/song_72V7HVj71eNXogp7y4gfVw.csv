long ago but not so very long ago
the world was different oh yes it was
you settled down and you built a town and made it live
and you watched it grow it was your town

verse 2
time goes by time brings changes you changed too
nothing comes that you cant handle so on you go
you never see it coming when the world caves in on you
on your town nothing you can do

bridge
main street isnt main street anymore
lights dont shine as brightly as they shone before
to tell the truth lights dont shine at all
in our town

verse 3
sun comes up each morning just like its always done
get up go to work start the day
you open up for business thats never gonna come
as the world rolls by a million miles away

outro
main street isnt main street anymore
no one seems to need us like they did before
its hard to find a reason left to stay
but its our town love it anyway
come what may its our townsee james taylor liveget tickets as low as 78you might also like2embed"
