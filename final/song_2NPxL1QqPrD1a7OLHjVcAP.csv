verse 1
be bboys and girls listen up
you can be anything in the world in god we trust
an architect doctor maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy it takes much practice
like i met a woman whos becoming a star
she was very beautiful leaving people in awe
singing songs lena horne but the younger version
hung with the wrong person got her strung on that heroin
cocaine sniffing up drugs all in her nose
couldve died so young now looks ugly and old
no fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best ima tell you how
put your hands in the air and take the vow
see nas liveget tickets as low as 106you might also likechorus
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be

verse 2
be bboys and girls listen again
this is for grownlooking girls whos only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be up in the club with fake id
careful fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide be careful some men be
rapists so act your age dont pretend to be
older than you are give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth but so
young boys you can use a lot of help you know
you thinking lifes all about smoking weed and ice
you dont wanna be my age and cant read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve then say it like this
chorus x2
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be

verse 3
be before we came to this country
we were kings and queens never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold the teachings and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today you see
if the truth is told the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas hoes
read more learn more change the globe
ghetto children do your thing
hold your head up little man youre a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man will sing shes my queeeeeen
chorus
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be
i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be where i wanna be
