oh my heart its a fish out of water
oh my heart its a fish on the rocks
and it bakes in the bad sun
oh my heart its a rock in the gutter
oh my heart its a rock and great boulder
and stuck in the gutter

chorus 1 ryan with molly guldemond and jasmin parkin
and i throw my heart back to the ocean
but it dont go far it come back floating
and i watch it wash it up with the dead fish
but it aint quite dead it just is like this
verse 2 ryan with molly guldemond
oh my heart its a house in tornado
oh my heart its a house in the sky
in the eye of tornado
oh my heart its a roof in el niño
oh my heart its a roof made of straw
in the jaw of el niño

chorus 2 ryan with molly and jasmin
and i pour my heart a new foundation
but it dont set hard it just stays shaking
and i scratch my name i scratch my name in
but it dont set hard it gets mixed back in

oh my heart its a fish out of water
oh my heart its a rock in the gutter
oh my heart its the black in a rainbow
oh my heart its so damn so cold

chorus 3 ryan with molly and jasmin
and i throw my heart into the fire
cause i want to set my heart on fire
and i watch it try befriending embers
but the ice dont melt in middecember
