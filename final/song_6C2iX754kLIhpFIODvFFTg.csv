he was sweet as cotton candy at a county fair
well hes a cold drink of water with butterscotch hair
he swore that he loved me
well i guess he probably did
cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
i saw my name next to his

chorus
a new tattoo stinging like a hornet
two little hearts like a big red warning
i wasnt looking for a permanent thing
first comes the ink then comes the ring
burn burn baby
i bet we couldve made a bunch of sweet memories
you shouldve slowed down mister
moving like a twisters just a little fast for me
so now its 0 to 60
and if you ever miss me im right there on your arm
dont you cry ill leave you something behind
skid marks and a double heart

verse 2
well hes a tough broncing buster
i bet he sleeps in his boots
well he tried to throw a rope around me right out of the shoot yeah
he swore that he loved me
well i reckon he probably did
cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
i thought here we go again

a new tattoo burning like a brand
two little hearts on my rodeo man
i wasnt looking for a permanent thing
first comes the ink then comes the ring
burn burn baby
i bet we couldve made a bunch of sweet memories

moving like a twisters just a little fast for me
well now its 0 to 60
and if you ever miss me im right there on your arm
dont you cry ill leave you something behind
skid marks and a double heart
