no you dont have to wear your best fake smile
dont have to stand there and burn inside
oh oh oh if you dont like it

verse 1
shes working late and making eyes at the door
she sick of everybody up on her floor
she wants the sun in her eyes but all she gets is ignored

she used to put it out and get it all back
but now she slipping trying to carry the act
shes sweating under the lights now shes beginning to crack
woah

chorus
no you dont have to wear your best fake smile
dont have to stand there and burn inside
oh oh oh if you dont like it
and you dont have to care so dont pretend
nobody needs a best fake friend
oh oh oh dont hide it

verse 2
no hesitation now she gets up and walks
she thinks of all the pain and pride that they caused
she emptied all the tip jars and wont get back what she lost
see james bay liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likeoutside the window with two fingers to show
she lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke
she doesnt have to look back to know when shes gotta go

chorus
no you dont have to wear your best fake smile
dont have to stand there and burn inside
oh oh oh if you dont like it
and you dont have to care so dont pretend
nobody needs a best fake friend
oh oh oh dont hide it

bridge
if you dont bleed it you dont need it anymore
if you dont need it get up and leave it on the floor
no more believing like its a voice you cant ignore
if you dont need it you dont need it no

chorus
no you dont have to wear your best fake smile
dont have to stand there and burn inside
oh oh oh if you dont like it
and you dont have to care so dont pretend
nobody needs a best fake friend
oh oh oh dont hide it
outro
no you dont have to wear your best fake smile
dont have to stand there and burn inside
oh oh oh if you dont like it
oh oh oh no if you dont like it14embed"
