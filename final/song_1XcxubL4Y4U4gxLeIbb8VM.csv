a haunted tale for someone else
a little bit about herself
wherever she is sleeping
flint strikes out to pierce the dark
cause a flame from just one spark
fill the room with smoke so harsh
she exhales a memory

the past is fadin
over time but its still hangin on for life

im now her used to be
he is now the one she needs
he is now the one she leans on
she looks out at the sunset
on a quilt of rags he holds her tight
and they raise a toast of bulleit rye
whiskey kills all things in time
like things she dont remember

the past is fadin
over time but its still hanging on for life

i am now an old headstone
and to her grave ill die alone
a testament of how shes grown
wherever she is sleepin
