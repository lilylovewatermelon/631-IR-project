i cant wait around for nobody i need it right now

solitaire earrings bling blingin from a mile away
i cant do what she want me to do she tryna take my child away
i think my past tryna haunt me haunt me

verse 1 lil baby

ive been havin nightmares about goin back to jail so i wake up

niggas that i used to love actin like theyre mad cause i got my cake up
aint gon never let it get to a nigga keep on grindin tryna get another million

they just wanna talk about my past they dont wanna accept the fact that im a boss
everything i wanted ima go and get it i aint trippin bout a cost yeah

verse 2 young thug
she gotta be piped up to feel my emphasis
she hot yeah she sizzlin
but cant love her more than a studio
serena and venus yeah most of my chains tennis
so i wore it all to the studio studio
my baby mama got pregnant had to buy a bitch a car to get an abortion
she just wanna see tears and sad faces on my shorty
but i cant get mad thats the way it go when youre fortunate
leave a million cash in the street nigga better not touch it on god
act like they came to lay hands so their trust dont get busted no cap
straight from mossberg to hillsborough
birds bless the js on that cizzurb
ridin in the lambo that the lil kids say bingo to
my last two years were the worst ones in my career but im still rich as you
disneylands where your kids go on a private jet when im into you when im into you
them lil bitches that be hatin need to pipe down pipe down
chorus lil baby with young thug
i cant wait around for nobody i need it right now
i might buy that car if it make the right sound
solitaire earrings bling blingin from a mile away
i cant do what she want me to do she tryna take my child away
i think my past tryna haunt me haunt me
what do everybody want from me
what do everybody want from me
what do everybody want from me from me
i gotta give it to em if i dont
