let me be the one who calls you baby all the time
surely you can take some comfort knowing that youre mine
just hold me tight lay by my side
and let me be the one who calls you baby all the time

prechorus
i found my place in the world
could stare at your face for the rest of my days

chorus
now i can breathe
turn my insides out and smother me
warm and alive im all over you
would you smother me

verse 2
let me be the one who never leaves you all alone
i hold my breath and lose the feeling that im on my own
leaves me all alone
hold me too tight stay by my side
and let me be the one who calls you baby all the time
all the time
