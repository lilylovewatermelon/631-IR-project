listen to yourself youre a hot mess
stttutter through your words breakin a sweat
whats it gonna take to confess
what we both know
yeah i was out of town last weekend
you were feelin like a pimp round your lame friends
now your little partys gonna end
so here we go

whoa you got a secret
whoa you couldnt keep it
whoa somebody leaked it
and now some sh— about to go down

chorus
i never thought that you would be the one
actin like a slut when i was gone
