rainman rainman
cacall me cacall me rainman rainman

verse 1
theres no need for me to lay out my clothes
when shes not around theres nowhere to go
make no attempts getting up out of this bed
i wanna open my eyes but i just close the curtains instead

prechorus
her thunderstorms shuts my lights off ooh
i got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow
cause right now i just cant catch a break

chorus
every day it rains
when she aint laying right here i can feel the coolness in the air
i know my chances aint fair
every day it rains
boredom be just my windowsill sound reaches my ear
go then it reappears
every day it rains
my heart starts drowning my vision gets cloudy
the flood moves around me
every day it rains
no sign of the light as the time goes by
forty days and forty nights

just when i thought ive gotten rid of you
huh i turn my face to your pillow thats soaked in your perfume
the waters raging no life vest and i cant swim through through no
my heart and my mind and my soul its lost somewhere in this deep blue

prechorus
her thunderstorms shut my lights off ooh
i got no missed calls maybe by tomorrow
cause right now i just cant get a break

chorus
every day it rains
when she aint laying right here i can feel the coolness in the air
i know my chances aint fair oh
every day it rains
boredom be just my windowsill sound reaches my ear
go then it reappears
every day it rains
my heart starts drowning drowning my vision gets cloudy cloudy
the flood moves around me me yeah
every day it rains
no sign of the light as the time goes by
forty days and forty nights

outro
baby cut my lights cut my lights back on back on baby back on
take me out your storm take me out your storm
baby cut my lights back on cut my lights back on baby oh save me
release me release me
release me from the sea of love
oh ohoh oh ohohooh oh oh baby
