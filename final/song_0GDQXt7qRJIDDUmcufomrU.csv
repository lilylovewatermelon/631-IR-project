home now end of the night
its colder to turn on your side
and i know youre up in two hours
but we didnt get tonight we dont have tomorrow
so dont ruin now

chorus
how we gonna move together just come closer
if we dont move together just come closer
how we gonna breathe how we gonna be together
just keeping the peace between the sheets

verse 2
and i creep in and everythings loud
im sorry ive woken you now
and well argue the tiniest thing
but we didnt get tonight we dont have tomorrow
so im done whispering done whispering

chorus
how we gonna move together just come closer
if we dont move together just come closer
how we gonna breathe how we gonna be together
just keeping the peace between the sheets
see james bay liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likebridge
so maybe dont give me cold cold shoulder
before you go turn around let me hold you
and let me stay in the dark of the morning
just one more thing

chorus
how we gonna move together just come closer
if we dont move together come closer
how we gonna breathe how we gonna be together
just keeping the peace just keeping the peace
just keeping the peace between these sheets15embed"
