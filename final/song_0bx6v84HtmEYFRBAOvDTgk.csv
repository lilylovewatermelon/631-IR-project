mmm i shut my eyes
you call but i just cut the line
i know your style
i know that you want one more night
and im backsliding
into this just one more time

prechorus
too far from over you
beams from your m2
are blowin through my room
and now you lay down in my shoes
you dyed your hair blue
oh so much déjà vu
and now

chorus
i can feel your love
your temporary touch
its a hit and run
you go back there when youre done
dont you want some more
cause i can feel your love

verse 2
mmm that purple touch
everyone who sees you falls in love
you eat us up
you live like youre on camera
you slide on top
a moon to all the juice in us

too far from over you
beams from your m2
are blowin through my room
and now you lay down in my shoes
you dyed your hair blue
oh so much déjà vu
and now

chorus
i can feel your love
your temporary touch
its a hit and run
you go back there when youre done
dont you want some more
cause i can feel your love
woo

bridge
maybe in time
when were both better at life
daylight can open my eyes
and youll still be by my side
but meanwhile
ive got my contact high
youve got your powdered lies
weve got these summertime nights
night by night i let you eat me alive
i want you to eat me alive
i want you to eat me alive
woo
ayy ayy ayy ayy
chorus
i can feel your love
your temporary touch
its a hit and run
you go back there when youre done
i can feel your love
your temporary touch
its a hit and run
you go back there when youre done
i can feel your love
your temporary touch
its a hit and run
you go back there when youre done
dont you want some more
cause i can feel your love

outro
i can feel your love
i can feel your love
i can feel your love
i can feel your love
i can feel your love24embed"
