lean forward slightly look straight at the speaker
and listen with a sparkle in your eye
as though you might be thinking
gee this is the most wonderful thing ive ever heard in all my life

verse 1
back in the day
we were eye to eye
the thought of you
had me running wild
they say love lost will never grow
but hey hey hey i still love you so

verse 2
oh when we met
you know the sun did shine
from your eyes
back into mine
oh if the sun is shine no more
well hey hey hey i still love you so

verse 3
ill beg the moon
and the stars above
bring me back myâ€“
that gal i love
i know youre gone youre gone for sure
but hey hey hey i still love you soyou might also likeembed"
