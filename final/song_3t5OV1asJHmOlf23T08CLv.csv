im a stones throw from the mill
and im a good walk to the river
when my workin day is over
well go swim our cares away
put your toes down in the water
and a smile across your face
and tell me that you love me
lovely lady may

verse 2
now i aint the sharpest chisel
that your hands have ever held
but darlin i could love you well
til the roll is called on high
ive seen my share of trouble
and ive held my weight in shame
but im baptized in your name
lovely lady may

verse 3
lord the wind can leave you shiverin
as it waltzes oer the leaves
its been rushin through my timber
til your love brought on the spring
now the mountains all are blushin
and they dont know what to say
cept a good long line of praises
for my lovely lady may

now i aint the toughest hickory
that your ax has ever fell
but im a hickory just as well
im a hickory all the same
i came crashin through the forest
as you cut my roots away
and i fell a good long ways
for my lovely lady may1embed"
