were six feet underground inside my bed
and all the little letters in my head
were spelling suicide but not by choice
was calling out for help but heard no noise no noise

prechorus 1 jon bellion
only the sound of my back breaking
but ever since you and your arms saved me

chorus jon bellion
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore

verse 2 jon bellion
the only friend i had wore black and red
the darker instruments inside my head
were playing suicide but not by choice by choice yeah
was calling out for help but heard no noise no noise

prechorus 2 jon bellion
only the sound of my hands shaking
but ever since you and your arms saved me

i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore
i dont hold the weight of the world anymore

break jon bellion
dont hold the weight of the world
i dont hold the weight i dont hold the weight

verse 3 blaque keyz
this the flow that helped me tip the scale
im stackin chips like chippendales without the strippin
get the bailiff out cause mr bellions out the cell
we skip the bail and out the jail
we hit the trail the route we took is hard to smell it out
so get to sniffin equipped with the gift of spit like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to spiderman
im brighter than leds on your tv
keyz is sharp as a dagger
who walks around with a swagger of kenny g
when you see me chill with the chatter
got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin
snackin on actors so pass me a napkin
chip on the shoulder the kid is colder than both dakotas
the winter soldier assassin coming after your captain
for honor and every day im getting stronger
no one will shock the world got a buzz like a mini blanka
when they apply the pressure its heavier than e honda
got what it takes to be great
but cant hold this weight any longer3embed"
