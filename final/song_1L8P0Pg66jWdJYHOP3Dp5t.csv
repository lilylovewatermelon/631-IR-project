our room was filled with silence
i guess wed said it all
i dont know when id seen our bedroom
so long i cant recall
wed built this thing between us
im not sure whats the cause
so i swallowed all my pride
and tonight i climbed the wall

chorus
tonight i climbed the wall
and took her by the hand
wed come too far to fall
couldnt stand to see it end
so tonight i climbed the wall

verse 2
making love is so much sweeter
when you love the one you hold
after all these years of holding her
youd think by now id know
now as we lie here together
all our troubles seem so small
just these satin sheets between us
because tonight i climbed the wall
