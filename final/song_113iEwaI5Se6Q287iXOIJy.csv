for you i was a flame
love is a losing game
five story fire as you came
love is a losing game
one i wish i never played
oh what a mess we made
and now the final frame
love is a losing game

verse 2
played out by the band
love is a losing hand
more than i could stand
love is a losing hand
selfprofessed profound
til the chips were down
know youre a gambling man
love is a losing hand

verse 3
though i battle blind
love is a fate resigned
memories mar my mind
love is a fate resigned
over futile odds
laughed at by the gods
and now the final frame
love is a losing game
