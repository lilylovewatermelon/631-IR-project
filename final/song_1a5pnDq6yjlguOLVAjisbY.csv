sifting through the ashes and scratching through my life
and how sick is it to live with the promises
no rhyme or reason expect another fight
and my decisions are based on your ignorance

chorus
and i i blame you for everything you do
for all the scars i bear and breathing all my air
for everything i ever ill ever do
i blame you

verse 2
im taking every prisoner through the ups and downs
and my ship aint gonna sink to the hypocrites
reach deep inside me and tear away my soul and
nobody left to comfort me anymore

chorus
and i i blame you for every thing you do
for the scars i bear and breathing all my air
for everything ill ever do
i blame you

chorus
and i i blame you for everything you do
for all the scars i bear and breathing all my air
for everything ill ever do
i blame you oh

i blame you
