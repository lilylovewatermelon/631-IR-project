as beautiful as fire against the evening sky
you fuel the lost desire
i no longer wanna die
take me by the hand and see beyond the lies
strip away the fences
leave me needing leave me blind

prechorus
i know youre so solo but i cant

chorus
take me away take me away take me away
cause i dont wanna lose control
take me away take me away take me away
cause i dont wanna lose it all

verse 2
relieved of all the pain
you let me see again
delivered from my shame now
and i am lost for what to say
cleansed and pure and weak
i suffer when i dream
i need to find a purpose
i need to feel you needing me

i know youre so solo but i cant

chorus
take me away take me away take me away
cause i dont wanna lose control
take me away take me away take me away
cause i dont wanna lose it all

bridge
pure and weak i suffer when i dream
and cleansed of me i suffer when i dream

because i want you to stay you take away the pain
i want you to stay i need you here to keep me sane
want you to stay you take the pain away
i want you to stay

chorus
take me away take me away take me away
i dont wanna lose control
take me away take me away take me away
i dont wanna lose it all

outro
i want you to stay you take the pain away
i want you to stay i need you here to keep me sane
want you to stay you take the pain away
i want you to stay i need you here to keep me saneembed"
