me and mrs jones
we got a thing going on
we both know that its wrong
but its much too strong
to let it go now

verse 1
we meet every day at the same cafe
sixthirty and no one knows shell be there
holding hands making all kinds of plans
while the juke box plays our favorite songs

chorus

we both know that its wrong
but its much too strong
to let it go now

verse 2
we gotta be extra careful
that we dont build our hopes up too high
cause shes got her own obligations
