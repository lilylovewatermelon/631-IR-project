though i seem cool calm and collected
making my way to hipster with glasses
was a little more than just nerve wrackin
kinda just counted on her to turn me into goo

verse 1
praise whatever it ended with a smile
cause for a bit a tad a little while
i expected you two to save the day with sly remarks
like hes so cute and whatever you wants
though the white jacket didnt fit
the friends i came with did perfectly
snugged right to my body
like sad movies and latenight drinks
couldâ€™ve guessed by the end of the hour
there was more than just a little smile on my face
covered in custard and cookies and cream
pissed off i had to leave
but all has to end

chorus
you got a smile that could light this town
and we might need it
cause it gets dark around here
real dark around here
most of my old friends
i can only stand for the weekend
but that doesnt apply here
doesnt apply here
you might also likeverse 2
the day started with a bloody drip
and a taste on my lips
that was a lot less than desired
awkward moments to the side
not all expiring fast
a tank top that didnt cover a thing
and a zipped down hoodie zipped to the bottom
had us laughing every time
no matter how many chest hairs there were in sight

chorus
you got a smile that could light this town
and we might need it
cause it gets dark around here
real dark around here
most of my old friends
i can only stand for the weekend
but that doesnt apply here
doesnt apply here5embed"
