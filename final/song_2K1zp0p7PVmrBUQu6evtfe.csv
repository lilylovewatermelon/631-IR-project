thats me right there on the corner
listening to wu in my walkman
neon lights at the water reflecting the city im lost in
thats me right there on the corner
i one day would be leaving
for a dream that i didnt have
that id one day would believe in
strange how the same place i ran from
is the same place i think of whenever the chance comes
its inevitable cause wherever i go

chorus
i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
theres a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me that ive lost my backbone back home
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone back home somewhere in stockholm

verse 2
im from a place where we never openly show our emotions
we drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles
and leave them to float in the ocean
im from a place where we never
separate people from people
some generalise but in general i
still believe that we are treated as equals
my father my mother my sister my brother
my friends and my familys there
my hope and my money my innocence in a sense
almost lost everything here
right where i was founded
is right where ill be found dead
the streets of my backbone until i get back home

i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
theres a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me that ive lost my backbone back home
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone back home somewhere in stockholm

bridge
im not alone i am the fire that burns
not of the city but out of the burbs
a river thats just dying of thirst
i am a reverend lying in church
a crack in the pattern a miracle waiting to happen
a promise that never was kept
one of those moments youll never forget
i am that feeling inside
the one we all know but cant really describe
i am the blood spill but im in love still
somewhere in stockholm
but im not alone
dont have to get by on my own
im finally home
hemma i stockholm
där jag hör hemma
chorus
i hear echoes of a thousand screams
as i lay me down to sleep
theres a black hole deep inside of me
reminding me that ive lost my backbone back home
somewhere in stockholm
i lost my backbone back home somewhere in stockholm4embed"
