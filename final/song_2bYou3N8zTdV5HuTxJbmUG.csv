i know i know it baby
sounds like your days been crazy
i just wanna hold ya
all the weight thats on your shoulders

i can turn those raindrops sunny
let me untie that tangle
put on that kiss an angel good mornin song
let me let me love it gone

chorus
little barefoot dancing
little kissing in the kitchen romancing
got a whole lot of love that ive been saving
and a bottle of wine thats been waiting
long time for a night like this

oh baby let me love it
