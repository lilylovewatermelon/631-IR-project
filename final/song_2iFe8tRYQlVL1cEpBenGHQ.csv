the suns goin down and im just hearin bout you goin out with friends
youre in a dress ive never seen before and your lipsticks the deepest shade of red
your kiss goodbye dont hit quite right
and neither does your alibi
yeah baby do your thing
go on and have a good time

chorus
i dont believe it
you got me feeling like a pistol
whatever you say
whos in your heart shaped locket

verse 2
sittin in the dark tellin myself everythings cool
im not the jealous type but im startin to feel like a heartbroke fool
sippin on a half drunk pint and its startin to rattle up my brain
are my instincts right or am i drinkin myself insane

chorus
i dont believe it
you got me feeling like a pistol
whatever you say
whos in your heart shaped locket
see brothers osborne liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebridge
you just got home mustve lost your keys
cause youre sneakin in the window
you see me sittin there you dont say a thing
cause you know that i know

chorus
i dont believe it
you got me feeling like a pistol
whatever you say
whos in your heart shaped locket
i dont believe it
you got me feeling like a pistol
whatever you say
whos in your heart shaped locket
your heart shaped locket
i dont believe it
you got me feeling like a pistol
whatever you say
whos in your heart shaped locketembed"
