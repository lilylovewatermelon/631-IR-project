i tied my bandana took my pack from the floor
you were still sleeping as i stood at the door
once more i was headin to god only knows where
thats when it hit me i was already there

chorus
i could ramble a thousand miles or more
never find the light ive seen in your eyes before
you gave me the freedom to go on my way
but you gave me much more you gave me the freedom to stay

verse 2
why keep on runnin just to wish on a star
searching for heaven when i know where you are
life is just empty when youre walking alone
so wherever were going girl lord its good to be at home
