if you only knew
im hangin by a thread the web i spin for you
if you only knew
id sacrifice my beating heart before id lose you

prechorus
i still hold on to the letters you returned
i swear ive lived and learned

chorus
its 403 and i cant sleep
without you next to me i toss and turn like the sea
if i drown tonight bring me back to life
breathe your breath in me
the only thing that i still believe in is you
if you only knew

verse 2
if you only knew
how many times i counted all the words that went wrong
if you only knew
how i refuse to let you go even when youre gone

prechorus
i dont regret any days i spent
nights we shared or letters that i sent
