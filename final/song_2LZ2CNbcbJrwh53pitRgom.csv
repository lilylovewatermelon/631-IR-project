we gather matters of the heart
so we can act a fool
its incomplete without you
the silver soul is running through
its a vision complete illusion yeah

verse 2
the needle on the spinning wheel
collecting silver coil
it gathers heat without you
whether or not youre turned from it
its a quick turn to let us in yeah

chorus
it is happening again
it is happening again
it is happening again
it is happening again

verse 3
the bodies lying in the sand
theyre moving in the dark
it is so quick to let us in
we feel it moving through our skin
its a sickness infinite quickness yeah
