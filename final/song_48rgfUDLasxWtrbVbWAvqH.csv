open up six
hes gone

verse 1
everywhere i turn no matter where i look
the systems in control its all run by the book
i gotta get away so i can free my mind
xscape is what i need from the electric eyes

no matter where i am i see my face around
they pin lies on my name then push from town to town
dont have a place to run but theres no need to hide
i gotta find a place but i wont hide away

chorus
xscape
gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
xscape
the pressure that i face from relationships has to go away
xscape
the man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end
xscape
i do what i wanna cause i gotta face nobody but me

interlude
sometimes i feel like
ive gotta get away
you might also likeverse 2
i tried to share my life with someone i can love
but games and money is all she ever thought of
how could that be my fault when she gambled and lost
im tired of silly games its time to make a change

why is it i cant do whatever i want to
when its my personal life and i dont live for you
so dont you try to tell me what is right for me
you be concerned about you i can do what i want to

chorus
