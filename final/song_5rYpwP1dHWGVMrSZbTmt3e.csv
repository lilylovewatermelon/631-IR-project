i know that it hurts sometimes but its beautiful
working every day now youre bleeding through your cuticles
passing through a portal as youre sittin in your cubicle
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
tryna keep your cool at your grandfathers funeral
finding out eventually the feeling wasnt mutual
you were not invited cause youre nothing like the usual
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
you wanna see your friends but youre stuck inside a hospital
doctor walks in and he tells you that its terminal
tumor in your brain and theyre sayin its inoperable
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
theyll kill your little brother and theyll tell you hes a criminal
theyll fucking kill you too so you better not get physical
welcome to america the type of shit is typical
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful

verse 2
wake up in the morning now you doing the impossible
find out whats important now youre feeling philosophical
when i die ill pack my bags move somewhere more affordable
isnt life horrible i think that life is horrible
you think shes adorable she thinks that youre intolerable
you think you can do it but your chances are improbable
once you feel unstoppable you run into an obstacle
isnt life comical i think that life is comical

and if you ever need a friend then you got me
and in the end when i die would you watch me
and if i try suicide would you stop me
would you help me get a grip or would you drop me
run away make friends with the moon
why you trippin youll be with your friends soon
there comes a time everybody meets the same fate
i think ima die alone inside my room

outro
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful
isnt life beautiful i think that life is beautiful181embed"
