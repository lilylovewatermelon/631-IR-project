is in the past
how could we see
wed never last

and time will tell
and youre all eyes
and now the truth
is your demise

all my heart
all of your tears
our whole world
is smoke and mirrors

all my heart
all of your tears
our whole world
is smoke and mirrors

youre here yourself
in wandered eyes
but now ive seen
through your disguise
from where i stand
a lovely view
your world unwinds
you come unglued
