pumpkins scream in the dead of night
this is halloween everybody make a scene
trick or treat until the neighbors going to die of fright

i am the one hiding under your bed
teeth grown sharp and eyes glowing red
i am the one hiding under yours stairs
fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

verse 2
in this town we call home
everyone hail to the pumpkin song
in this town dont we love it now
everybodys waiting for the next surprise
round that corner man hiding in the trash can
somethings waiting now to pounce and how youll scream
this is halloween red and black slimy green

everybody scream everybody scream
in our town of halloween
i am the clown with the tear away face
here in a flash and gone without a trace
i am the who when you call whos there

i am the shadow on the moon at night
filling your dreams to the brim with fright
