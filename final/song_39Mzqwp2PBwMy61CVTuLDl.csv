so there was this woman and
she was uh on an airplane and
shes flying to meet her fianc√©
sailing high above the the largest ocean
on planet earth and she was seated
next to this man who you know
she had tried to start conversations
and only really the only thing
shed heard him say was to order his bloody mary
and shes sitting there and shes reading
this really arduous magazine article about a
third world country that she couldnt
even pronounce thethe name of and
shes feeling very bored and very despondent
and then uh suddenly theres this huge mechanical failure and one of the engines gave out
and they started just falling thirty thousand feet
and the pilots on the microphone and hes hes saying
im sorry im sorry oh my god im sorry
and apologizing and and she looks at the man and she says she says she says
where are we going and he looks at her and he says
were going to a party it its a birthday party
its your birthday party happy birthday darling
we love you very very very very very very very much
and then uh he starts humming this little tune and and uh it kind of goes like this its kind of
one two one two three four

we must talk in every telephone get eaten off the web
we must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have read
into the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair
we must stare we must stare we must stare

verse 2
we must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sell
set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
into the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesnt dream
we must sing we must sing we must sing
and itll go like this all right

chorus
while my mother waters plants my father loads his gun
he says death will give us back to god
just like the setting sun
is returned to the lonesome ocean

postchorus
and then they splashed into the deep blue sea
oh it was a wonderful splash

verse 3
we must blend into the choir sing as static with the whole
we must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soul
and in this endless race for property and privilege to be won
we must run we must run we must run
verse 4
we must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laugh
we must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlights and our love
we must plunge we must plunge we must plunge

bridge
and when well get down there way down to the very bottom of everything
and then well see it oh well see it well see it well see it

chorus
oh my mornings coming back the whole worlds waking up
all the city buses swimming past im happy just because
i found out i am really no one11embed"
