longing to suffocate
spilling my tears as you turn away
light cast onto a memory
darkens the scenery
i can’t know you the way you know me
visions of you through clouds of smoke
inhale until i choke
filling my lungs but now i’m alone
cold as an emptiness consumes
rain dripping in my wounds
you don’t want me the way i want youyou might also like3embed"
