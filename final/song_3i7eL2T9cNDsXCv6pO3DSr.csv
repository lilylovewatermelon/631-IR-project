yo yo check this out
theres a lot of cats out here tryna get a deal
theres a lot of cats out here makin promises and never following through with em
i was in the same boat i feel you
yeah so we gonna reverse this and ask them how they would feel yeah

verse 1
how would you like it if somebody came along claimin they moneys long and they wanna put you on
all they doing is playing with you
they got the money and the deal but they wont give it to you
all you tryna do is get this money
a crib for your mommy a sample from a honey
come through the hood with ya 5 or ya 6
or some 21s with some fake niggas on your dick

chorus
why should i keep on strugglin and goin through hard times
somebody tell me where do we go
cause at this point i cant give up
but its takin
forever forever for

verse 2

like stealin robbin man you better chill
damn i gotta keep it real
i let the pen do the talkin let the haters keep walkin
i pray for the day word gets out my albums droppin

the man upstairs gotta plan i gotta keep on believin
i just wanna get away someday
every time i look up and try to smile
something goes wrong and it brings me back downembed"
