whoa whoa whoa who knows

verse 1
when i was a baby child
my daddy said to me
many mountains we must climb
before well be free
but he never told me
about the bruises on my knees
how they would be the map that leads him where we need to be

prechorus
and oh that storm came down
forty days forty nights

chorus
who knows
what the thunder and lightning will bring
maybe the storm will cover my dreams
maybe the sun will shine no more
who knows
which way the wind is blowing
and when we look back on these things
we wont cry no more
whoa whoa whoa who knows
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 2
wandering blindly
searching for the truth
and anchored to a solid rock
that we could hold on to
but theres no tomorrow
not for everyone
who will hear your last harsh words
when your time on earth is gone

prechorus

chorus

outro
whoa tilt the lamp now
dont let the wind blow it out
oh guide the light child
because one day its going to shine
sing up until the darkness is lifted
sing up until the darkness is liftedembed"
