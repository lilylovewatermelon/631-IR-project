yeah yeah ah
similar ways similar game
starting to feel the similar pain
are you sure we havent met before
i know ya face i know ya name
but i dont know you
isnt that crazy isnt that crazy

chorus
i think we may be
in a different book on a different page
you said you are different but youre the same
stranger i can not tell you
how many there have been
that were just like you
i do not need you
cause youre just like them
i meet em everyday
they all seem to be the same
lame okay
i meet em everyday
they all seem to be the same
its strange ah

verse 2
familiar time familiar place
starting to feel the familiar shame
cause i know what you have come here for
you know my name you know my face
but you dont know me
you must be crazy
or i must be crazy or is it maybe
ive been here times before and
ive said yes meaning no but oh
a lot of shit has changed
lot of shit has changed
lotlot of shit has changed

they were just like you they have all tried to
youre not the only one
i meet em everyday
they all seem to be the same
lame okay
i meet em everyday
they all seem to be the same
its strange ah
i think we may be
in a different book on a different page
you said you are different
but youre the same
