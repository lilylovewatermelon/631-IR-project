i was bitter broken busted
ripping up our pictures
all these immature emotions
my eyes run like rivers
i lashed out i burned your letters
i blacked out i dont remember at all

prechorus
and what we did was childish
can we put this behind us ooh ooh
whitehot rage and i was blinded
our big love was so misguided ooh ooh

chorus
we cant deny that it was magic
nothing was nice but i loved every minute
all the best of stories end tragic
we were ooh we were bad
we were good while it lasted ooh ooh
we were good while it lasted ooh ooh

verse 2
forgive me for the nasty things
that i say when im wounded
now that i can think rationally i feel so stupid
this is so small in the big simulation
in the grand scheme of things
we were just a blip we were just a blip
