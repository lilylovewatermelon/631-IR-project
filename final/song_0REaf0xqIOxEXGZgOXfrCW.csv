and i remember how the pillows felt like clouds
or was it the other way around
and how your neighbor came in to yell at you
when the party got too loud
and when i snuck into your living room
and i wished that you would follow
at first you didnt but then you did
and it was already tomorrow
and you told me how you had an uncle
who played the villain in those movies
and how he died and then you cried
you apologized profusely
i was nervous that this was good as i could ever feel
and i was right

chorus
i confess to thinking sex was my salvation
really they just start with the letter s
youll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
its as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get

verse 2
and ill always remember picking up
my favorite records from your apartment
kissing you before you left me for new york
werent you a princess or an heiress
or just the daughter of a rich man
in this land of constant sunshine
i thought youd never have to work
new york citys cold and when you love someone
you should hold on to them so tightly
till you crush them or they wriggle from your grasp
you dont just stand there and say nothing
but at least i learned my lesson
you might also likechorus
and i confess to thinking sex was my salvation
really they just start with the letter s
youll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
its as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get

bridge
if i ever make it to new york
like i said that i would
would it do me any good
if i ever make it to new york
like i told you on the phone

chorus
and i confess to thinking sex was my salvation
when really they just start with the letter s
youll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
its as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get
as close as i would ever get3embed"
