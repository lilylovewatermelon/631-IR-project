i been waitin on this
yeah

verse
all of this disorder no addressin
the crown is broken in pieces but theres more in my possession
theres a whole lot in my possession
who do you really love well thats sure to be in question
my mount rushmore is me with four different expressions
whos givin out this much return on investment
after my run man how is that even a question
after this summer man how is that even a—
ive had real philly niggas try to write my endin
takin shots with the goat and talked about shots that we sendin
ive had scuffles with bad boys that wasnt pretendin
ive had too many nights to mention thats just the beginnin
im pretty sure we got a label im still independent
i fell back a hundred times when i dont get the credit
seen this movie a hundred times i know where its headed
realize someone gotta die when no onell dead it
niggas gamblin with they life for some content
thats the type of lottery that could get your top picked
i am a creamofthecrop nigga
you niggas pop mollies my malis pop niggas
house on both coasts but i live on the charts
i have tea with the stars and i swim with the sharks
and i see in the dark wasnt this cold at the start
think my soul has been marked theres a hole in my heart
yeah i was about to— man i thought about it
its unsettlin to talk about it
free all of my niggas that they caught with it
rip my niggas that they caught without it
this just the intro let me not get ahead of myself
this is gods plan young man you said it yourself
always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
daddy got suits like bernie mac he dresses himself
i stopped askin myself and i started feelin myself
now i gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
i aint even have to cut the tie it severed itself
this just the intro let me not get ahead of myselfsee drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like26embed"
