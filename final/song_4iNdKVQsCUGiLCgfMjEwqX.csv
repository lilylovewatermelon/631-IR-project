one jump ahead of the breadline
one swing ahead of the sword
i steal only what i cant afford
thats everything

one jump ahead of the lawmen
thats all and thats no joke
these guys dont appreciate im broke

crowd riffraff street rat scoundrel take that

aladdin just a little snack guys
crowd rip him open take it back guys
aladdin i can take a hint gotta face the facts
youre my only friend abu
crowd who
oh its that aladdins hit the bottom
hes become a oneman rise in crime
id blame parents except he hasnt got em

aladdin gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat
tell you all about it when i got the time

one jump ahead of the slowpokes
one skip ahead of my doom
next time gonna use a nom de plume
one jump ahead of the hitmen
one hit ahead of the flock
i think ill take a stroll around the block
you might also likecrowd stop thief vandal outrage scandal

aladdin lets not be too hasty
lady still i think hes rather tasty
aladdin gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat
otherwise wed get along
crowd wrong

aladdin one jump ahead of the hoofbeats vandal
one hop ahead of the hump street rat
one trick ahead of disaster scoundrel
theyre quick but im much faster take that
here goes better throw my hand in
wish me happy landin
