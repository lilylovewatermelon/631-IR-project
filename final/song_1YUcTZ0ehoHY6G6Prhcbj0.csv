ooh

verse 1 conor oberst lianne la havas sivu marika hackman joe newman
dry dunes cater for jumping boys
from the nape of her neck he made his descent
they watched men hurl from rock to sea
like sternum to button lined lip pinches in between

chorus joe newman marika hackman
your foothills
your warm

whistling interlude

verse 2 conor oberst lianne la havas sivu marika hackman joe newman
iris swims quietly beside me
oh the weeds and larger leaves sway
and stretch themselves beneath
blue dragonflies dart to and fro
i tie my life to your balloon and let it go

chorus joe newman marika hackman
your foothills
