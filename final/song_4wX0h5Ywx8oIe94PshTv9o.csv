ive held it all inward god knows ive tried
but its an awful awakenin in a country boys life
to look in the mirror in total surprise
at the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

amanda light of my life
fate should have made you a gentlemans wife
amanda light of my life
fate should have made you a gentlemans wife

verse 2
its a measure of people who dont understand
the pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
i got my first guitar when i was fourteen
now im over thirty still wearing jeans

chorus
amanda light of my life
