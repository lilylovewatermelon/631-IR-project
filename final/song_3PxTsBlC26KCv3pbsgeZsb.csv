say youd never give away your heart again
ill be knocking till you let me in
i know you told me youd rather be lonely you dont even know me
thats why i no longer want to be a stranger

verse 1
sorry you put your trust in others and they let you down
and all the the secrets and unknown evidence now in the open that you found
cried yourself to sleep so many nights said youd never again
im not the one you hold it against baby its not my blame

prechorus
girl you independent as hell
and doing it by yourself
but what you gon do when the night time get cold
i know you told me youd rather be lonely
you dont even know me
i aint moving out the way for nothing
im stubborn

chorus
cause you say youd never give away your heart again
ill be knocking till you let me in
i want the title of your closest friend baby
i no longer want to be a stranger
tell me
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta do
what i gotta do anything i gotta do
what i gotta do what i gotta do tell me
what i gotta do

youre stuck inside no matter how hard you try to forget
dont you wish there was a button we can reset and make it easy
but you cant take back the decision that you made to love
i know its one that you regret and not too proud of
because you keep telling me

prechorus
girl you independent as hell
and doing it by yourself
but what you gon do when the night time get cold
i know you told me youd rather be lonely
you dont even know me
i aint moving out the way for nothing
im stubborn

chorus
cause you say youd never give away your heart again
ill be knocking till you let me in
i want the title of your closest friend baby
i no longer want to be a stranger
baby tell me
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta do what i gotta baby tell me
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta do
bridge
i remember the breakup
and the condition that my heart was in
but i would never surrender no no
i gotta be stronger theres nothing time cant heal
girl i know your scarred
all i ask is a chance to come in and do my part
its nothing but fear and you been holding on since
too under pressure and i see you sinking in

chorus
say youd never give away your heart again
ill be knocking till you let me in
i know you told me youd rather be lonely you dont even know me
thats why i no longer want to be a stranger
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta do what i gotta do
what i gotta doembed"
