we used to chase that chattanooga freight
couple of kids in a chevrolet
catch a little air when we cross the tracks
sipping on something from a paper sack
you hang your shirt on that maple limb
slipping through the moon to the river bend
wasnt very long i was jumping in jumping in
i guess im still doing now what i was doing then

chorus
chasin you like a shot of whiskey
burning going down burning going down
chasin you like those goodbye tail lights
headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
chasin that freedom chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
chasin that you and me i only see in my rearview
yeah im laying here tonight holding someone new
still chasin you still chasin you

verse 2
you always used to talk about la
i heard you got as far as santa fe
well you know i tried to track you down
i only got as far as guitar town
singing about a girl i used to know used to know
well you should know that i havent given up
im just on your radio

chasin you like a shot of whiskey
burning going down burning going down
chasin you like those goodbye tail lights
headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
chasin that freedom chasin that feeling that got gone too soon
chasin that you and me i only see in my rearview
yeah im laying here tonight holding someone new
still chasin you still chasin you

chorus
chasin you like a shot of whiskey
burning going down burning going down
chasin you like those goodbye tail lights
headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
chasin that freedom chasin that feeling that got gone too soon
chasin that you and me i only see in my rearview
yeah im laying here tonight holding someone new
still chasin you still chasin you
