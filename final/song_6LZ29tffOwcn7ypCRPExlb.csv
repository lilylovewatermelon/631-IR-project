i tried to make a break what a fool
i shouldve known i never listen
im in a cage an animal im in a cage

hook 1 josh homme
but the reptiles they wont let me go
i think they want you to stray

verse 2 josh homme
watch the monkey dance give him a taste
look at him hes always smiling
help me to escape your mouth agape you foreign tourist

hook 2 josh homme
woe is me it will be a funeral
a circus ill rap on the cell door

prechorus josh homme with dave grohl
questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
so just you let those flames die down

chorus josh homme with dave grohl
trained by consequence and the lash it leaves me breathless
their praise is a poison to us all
in the moonlight their scars flash like jewelry
get too precious get locked up in a cage
you might also likeverse 3 josh homme
wanna get gotta risk any move
misconstrued then youre screwed
tongues flash and flick as if theyre screaming

hook 3 josh homme
oh they lie just like a lover
oh do they those kisses will burn

verse 4 josh homme
under the lights they snap a finger
you jump you answer
like a naive hooker with a big dumb smile

hook 4 josh homme
for the reptiles i guess youll never know
they wont let you go cause youre the soup du jour thats for sure

prechorus josh homme with dave grohl
questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
so just you let those flames die down
see them reptiles crawl getting closer
why wont someone come to drive them away

chorus 2 josh homme with dave grohl
dont rest too long its a mistake we cant take back
take one lying down for a change
and oh its like cleaning up after an orgy when its over
i wish someone would burn this place to the ground1embed"
