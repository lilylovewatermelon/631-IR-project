breakin up slowly is a hard thing to do
i love you only but its makin me blue
so dont send me flowers like you always do
its hard to be lonely but its the right thing

verse 1 nikki lane
are these my good years or do i have none
are there really good years for everyone
i dont wanna live with a life of regret
i dont wanna end up like tammy wynette

chorus lana del rey  nikki lane
cause breakin up slowly is a hard thing to do
i love you only but its makin me blue
so dont send me flowers like you always do
its hard to bе lonely but its the right thing to do

verse 2 lana del rey
georgе got arrested out on the lawn
we might be breakin up after this song
will he still love me long after im gone
or did he see it comin all along

chorus lana del rey  nikki lane
cause breakin up slowly is a hard thing to do
i love you only and its makin me blue
so dont send me flowers like you always do
its hard to be lonely baby breakin up is hard to do
breakin up slowly baby breakin up is hard to do
breakin up slowly is a hard thing to do
i love you only and its makin me blue
so dont send me flowers like you always do
