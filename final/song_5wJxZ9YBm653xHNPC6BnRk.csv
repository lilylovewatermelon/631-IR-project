come one and all and see the broken man
talking to himself
he sits and waits for something better
hell never find it here
the people touch his hair and pinch his cheek
he cant even feel it

prechorus 1
there it goes again
hes listening to someone
he hears the bitter laughter
and all he wants to know is

chorus
why
does any of it matter
i cant take it anymore
youve got to try
the inhale that makes the exhale
so much better

verse 2
he wipes his hands on anything in reach
he never feels clean
he shakes at night because his nerve is gone
every muscle hurts
come one and all and see what happened
that broken man is me

now i know i disappear
i cant find my way from out of here
everything is fading on me
someone tell me
someone tell me
someone tell me

i cant take it anymore

the inhale that makes the exhale
