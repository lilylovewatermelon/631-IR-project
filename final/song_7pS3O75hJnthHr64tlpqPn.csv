my 16 locked and loaded
all fear has been aborted
you say the words and my weapon is drawn
this one could be my last time
some people call it war crime
i may be staring down a lethal site to die

chorus
nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
leaving my fear on the danger line
suffering a man should never know
leaving my faith on the danger line

verse 2
i do this for my family
my daughter loves her daddy
too many talk down on things they dont know
with colors never faded
reckless and unabated
they may take me but never take us all
ill crawl

chorus
nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
leaving my fear on the danger line
suffering a man should never know
leaving my faith on the danger line

i know what youre thinking
ive been there before
so think of the times
the time we spent laughing away
so think of the times times at home at home
life without a care
now i find myself in my own blood
never thought iâ€™d lie in my own blood
the damage done is far beyond repair
i never put my faith in up above
never had much faith in up above
but now im hoping someones there

outro
i never meant to leave this world alone
i never meant to hurt the ones who cared
and all this time i thought wed just grow old
you know no one said its fair
tell my baby girl that its alright
ive sung my last song today
remind the lord to leave his light on for me
