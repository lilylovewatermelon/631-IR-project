verse xxxtentacion
trapped in a concept falsely accused misused
and misled bitch im hopin you fuckin rest in peace
now the fact that im alone is fuckin comfortin
and i cant seem to shake this fuckin feeling in my…

im cut open her fingers in all my stab wounds
and if she could shed probably dance on my grave
inside my head i see your face i fuckin hate that i love you still
yeah

with this pain inside of my chest
got no choice but to carry on uh
carry on life flies so just carry on
with this pain inside of my chest
got no choice but to carry on uh
carry on life flies so just carry on
with this pain inside of my chest
got no choice but to carry on uh
