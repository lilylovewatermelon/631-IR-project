i do not know why i would go
in front of you and hide my soul
cause youre the only one who knows it
yeah youre the only one who knows it
and i will hide behind my pride
ddont know why i think i could lie
cause theres a screen on my chest
yeah theres a screen on my chest

verse 2
i cant see past my own nose
im seeing everything in slomo
look out below crashing down to the ground
just like a vertical locomotive thats a train
am i painting the picture thats in my brain
a train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane
my flows not great okay i conversate with people
who know if i flow on a song ill get no radio play
while youre doing fine theres some people and i
who have a really tough time getting through this life
so excuse us while we sing to the sky
