as you see the ogs from grand hustle done laid it down again
tip shawty
hey yo this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
get ya shit together come on
all the eight nines and dimes
id like to welcome yall to the best time of ya life
ya understand that
all the stones is real
and its all chrome on the wheels ya know
anything less is uncivilized

verse 1 ti
pull up to the club lift both doors up
hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
walked in the door make the show hold up
cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
the kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
so we dont approach them they come and approach us
roll the dro up then go post up
look down with the west finna go sho nuff
in the vip and all eyes on us
hoes chill poppin pills blowin dro no dust
what cha say got a man so what
i dont know him baby and he dont know her
i got a new phantom and my own chauffeur
ya think ya finna be thinkin bout him no sir
probably prefer to tell ya man good night
unless you dont wanna know what the good life look like
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likechorus lil kim  ti
if you aint gettin money good night
i know what a broke nigga look like
when ya ridin in ya wheels get ya shit together
boy them diamonds aint real get ya shit together
now we can ball seven days six nights
if that head and that pussy hit right
hey match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

verse 2 ti
hey im off the scene with louis the thirteenth
chains swings to my jeans and my tshirt clean
in case you been researching im the king
with a style as mean as the earth seem
chest on ice and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring money aint no thing
you think im playin but i aint joking
the dro king if it aint purple i aint smoking
rubberband bank rolls fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
try to shine is you out your mind boy you better not
i walk around with more money than you ever got
shrewd attitude like i never had to sell a rock
shawty i can get you in whatever spot
backstage front row what i got to front for
im getting bored dont even know what i stunt for
got a lot of rides what it hurt to cop one more
chorus lil kim  ti
if you aint gettin money good night
i know what a broke nigga look like
when ya ridin in ya wheels get ya shit together
boy them diamonds aint real get ya shit together
now we can ball seven days six nights
if that head and that pussy hit right
hey match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

verse 3 ti
to all my hot girls if you wanna come chill
or roll on chrome wheels let me tell you what it is
we fixin throw a little party at the crib
where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
the basements cool but the pools unreal
where that millionaire lives shit remains concealled
so pop a pill put on your blindfold
im hitting the dance floor and grab eightynine more
let em know we on the way where they been trying to go
i knew i had em when they asked me what kind of diamonds are those
headed to the spot pouring double shots of xo
play the love below ane watchem undress slow
flicks on the flat screen make em want to get low
and spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
when they kick it with the king they dont wanna let go
so whatcha gonna tell a nigga when he tell ya lets go
chorus lil kim  ti
if you aint gettin money good night
i know what a broke nigga look like
when ya ridin in ya wheels get ya shit together
boy them diamonds aint real get ya shit together
now we can ball seven days six nights
if that head and that pussy hit right
hey match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together1embed"
