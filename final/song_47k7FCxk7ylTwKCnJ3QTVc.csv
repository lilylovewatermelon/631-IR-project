honey whatd you take

verse 1
think my brain is rotting in places
i think my heart is ready to die
i think my body is falling in pieces
i think my blood is passing me by

chorus
honey whatd you take whatd you take
honey look at me
tell me what you took whatd you take
honey whatd you take whatd you take
honey look at me
tell me what you took whatd you take

verse 2
i think my fate is losing its patience
i think the ground is pulling me down
i think my life is losing momentum
i think my ways are wearing me down

bridge
but if i gave up on being pretty i wouldnt know how to be alive
i should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
