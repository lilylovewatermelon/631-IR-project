all i ever wanted was something classic
the kind of love song that goes on til the end of time
all i ever wanted was a little magic
with a good laugh jetblack sparkle in his eyes

chorus
youre my velvet elvis i aint never gonna take you down
making everybody jealous when they step into my house
soft to the touch feels like love knew it as soon as i felt it
youre my velvet elvis baby

verse 2
i dont really care bout the mona lisa
i need a graceland kind of man whos always on my mind
i wanna show you off every evening
go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

chorus
youre my velvet elvis i aint never gonna take you down
making everybody jealous when they step into my house
soft to the touch feels like love knew it as soon as i felt it
youre my velvet elvis baby
youre my velvet elvis baby
