let the bough break let it come down crashin
let the sun fade out to a dark sky
i cant say id even notice it was absent
cause i could live by the light in your eyes
ill unfold before you
would have strung together
the very first words of a lifelong love letter

chorus
tell the world that we finally got it all right
i choose you
i will become yours and you will become mine
i choose you
i choose you
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
there was a time when i would have believed them
if they told me you could not come true
just loves illusion
but then you found me and everything changed
and i believe in something again
my whole heart
will be yours forever
this is a beautiful start
to a lifelong love letter

tell the world that we finally got it all right
i choose you i choose you i do
i will become yours and you will become mine
i choose you i choose you i choose
i choose you i choose you

bridge
we are not perfect
well learn from our mistakes
and as long as it takes
i will prove my love to you
i am not scared of the elements
i am underprepared but i am willing
and even better
i get to be the other half of you

chorus
tell the world that we finally got it all right
i choose you yeah i choose you i do
i will become yours and you will become mine
i choose you i choose you i do
i choose you i choose you i do
i choose you i choose you18embed"
