she wants to break up every night
she wants to break up every night
dont wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
she wants to break up every night
then tries to fuck me back to life
how can i help it if i like the way she makes me feel it

verse 1
give me time give me space give me reason
thats what you tell me when youre leaving
change your mind every night like the seasons
youre insatiable

prechorus
and i know you say you want it now want it now
give me the runaround runaround
which one am i with now
shes got seven personalities every ones a tragedy

chorus

dont wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
she wants to break up every night
then tries to fuck me back to life
