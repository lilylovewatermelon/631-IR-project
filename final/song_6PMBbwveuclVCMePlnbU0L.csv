your arms around me come undone
makes my heart beat like a drum
see the panic in my eyes
kiss me only when i cry

prechorus 1
cause you always want what youre running from
and you know this is more than you can take

chorus
baby dont forget my name
when the morning breaks us
baby please dont look away
when the morning breaks us
oh your touch so bittersweet ah ah ah ah
baby dont forget my name
when the morning breaks us

verse 2
your cheek is softly by the sun
makes my heart beat like a drum
i know it hurts you i know it burns you
hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
look into me tell me why youre crying i need to know
