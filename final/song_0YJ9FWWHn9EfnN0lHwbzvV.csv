just as you take my hand
just as you write my number down
just as the drinks arrive
just as they play your favourite song
as your bad day disappears
no longer wound up like a spring
before youve had too much
come back in focus again
the walls are bending shape
theyve got a cheshire cat grin
all blurring into one
this place is on a mission
before the night owl
before the animal noises
closed circuit cameras
before youre comatose

verse 2
before you run away from me
before youre lost between the notes
the beat goes round and round
the beat goes round and round
i never really got there
i just pretended that i had
words are blunt instruments
words are sawnoff shotguns
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
before you run away from me
before youre lost between the notes
just as you take the mic
just as you dance dance dance
you might also likechorus
a jigsaw falling into place
so there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
she looks back and you look back
not just once and not just twice
wish away your nightmare
wish away the nightmare
you got the light you can feel it on your back
a light you can feel it on your back
your jigsaw falling into place47embed"
