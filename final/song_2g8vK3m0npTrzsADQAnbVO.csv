every time i walk i watch
i look i notice i observe
i read the signs
and the signs are pointing in the wrong direction
the signs are not naming the streets
or leading you to the highways
the signs are naming names
tombstones to mark the death of children not even born
and i dont mean abortion i mean what is to come
the signs are telling me to turn back around
the signs are telling me to research my past
the signs are telling me to learn from my mistakes
the signs are asking me questions
do you wanna watch it all fall apart
do you have any control
is there anything that you can do
time is not a nice person
i know because the sign said it
time can be generous but ultimately time is indifferent
time does not give two damns or a fuck
so what will you do
what will we do
you might also likeso im in the middle of the street talkin to the signs
and people are lookin at me pointing and laughing
like this mothafuckers crazy

but do they not see the signs
do you not see the signs
if there is one thing in this world
that you can depend on
that you can bet your last dollar on
its the ignorance of the american people
but still i have faith
but still i read the signs
they are indeed there
some of us are lost
and will not find our way
no matter what the signs say
some of us do not see the signs because
we are too busy shopping
some of us do not see the signs because
we cant help but stop and look at the accidents and stare
we are in a daze
we are amazed by the worlds displays
some of us do not see the signs because
we are giving spare change to the homeless
we are getting gassed
we are volunteering for duty
and we are watching television
we are driving around in circles on spinners
and we are working eight to six
we are on our way to the club
we are high we are drunk and we are sober
and we do not see the signs
we are listening to a moron babble
we are listening to tongues that lie
we give them an ear
we give them a hand
we give them both eyes
so we cannot see the signs
slow there are children playing in the streets
and they cannot read the signs
they are only children
stop
stop
i fear there is no uturn
and that this road deadends
because we cannot read the signs
do you not see the signs
we must read the signs
and we must turn around
we must turn around
we gotta turn this shit around
and we gotta read the signs
we must read the signs
we must read the signs
we must read the signs
we gotta read the signs
we gotta turn this shit around
we must turn this shit around10embed"
