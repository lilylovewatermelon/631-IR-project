let me tell you a story
about an old friend of mine
somebody left her in a shopping cart
in a parking lot for us to find
just a fuzzy black pup
she was hungry and feeling alone
we put her in the back seat
and told her we were takin her home

chorus
run maggie run
with the heart of a rebel child
oh run maggie run
be just as free as you are wild

verse 2
a few kids later
we moved out on the farm
and she followed those kids around
yeah she kept them safe from harm
and she loved to chase squirrels
and playin out in the snow
shed take off like a bullet
man you should have seen her go

run maggie run
with the heart of a rebel child
oh run maggie run
be just as free as you are wild

verse 3
it was rainin on a monday
the day that maggie died
she woke up and couldnt use her legs
so i laid down by her side
she put her head on my hand
like shed done so many times
i told her she was a good dog
then i told her goodbye

chorus
run maggie run
with the heart of a rebel child
oh run maggie run
be just as free as you are wild

verse 4
i had a revelation
as the tractor dug a hole
i can tell you right now
that a dog has a soul
and i thought to myself
as we buried her on the hill
i never knew me a better dog
and i guess i never will
chorus
run maggie run
with the heart of a rebel child
oh run maggie run
be just as free as you are wild
oh run maggie run
with the heart of a rebel child
oh run maggie run
be just as free as you are wild2embed"
