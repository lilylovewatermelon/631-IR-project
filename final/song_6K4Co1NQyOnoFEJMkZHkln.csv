id rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
every time you kiss me
dont say that you miss me
just come get me

hook
dont know why just know i want to
dont know why just know i want you

verse 2
id rather be breaking things cause we cant see
were too busy kissing
just making scenes here come the police
they know about your history
how you live and love like fuck rules
dont care why just know i love you
