i dont know why i even try cause you dont want this no more
i would rather leave before i hurt you
and i would have died long ago if i aint have my faith
i see youre startin to hate me i see it in your face
my home dont feel like home
just like my heart is empty
you changed the number on your phone
so when i call you aint gotta listen

prechorus chris brown
and all your girls think that i aint shit
and they the same ones lost in the club them bitches is basic
now im number one thats lost in love i cant take it
im on a knee youre gonna see a grown man cry i wont lie

chorus chris brown
im startin to hate me
a little more and more each day
i dont know me
its like i cant get out of my own way
and you dont love me
you dont love me
if i knew better
i would do better
