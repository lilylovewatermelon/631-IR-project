ayy space we astronauts with this shit
yeah
i just need my space right now

chorus babyface ray  lucki
im thinkin bout changin the culture
takin the sauce then hidin from vultures
fivestar telly treat the bitch like an office
labels they hurt cant make me a offer
they say that they saw me
peepin they watchin they lookin
stop with the games you a rookie
foreigns im pushin
lean back play with her pussy
cant kick the cup im a junkie ayy ayy

verse lucki  babyface ray
told her i love her but im never settlin probably repetitive
protectin my energy
that quagen my remedy im thankin god gave me drugs he protectin my enemies
i gave her money i hope she forgive me
til im in her city
i fuck a bentayga ho right in the back of a hemi still curvin a rookie
im really fightin them demons still sick of them 30s but im still gon fuck with the 20s
they tell me these niggas been pressin the wrong one can stretch em but i get my shit from my auntie
game from my uncle fuck is an l
get ws flip it around i get money
she unlock the door she know that im comin ayy ayy ayy
im sunny bitch i been school since a youngin ayy
i keep on sinnin myself cause im bad at listening
postin my cup probably bad for business
i be thinkin everything niggas say cap
rookieass ho sellin out for an app
