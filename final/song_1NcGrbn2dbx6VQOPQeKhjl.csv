gonna sell my car and go to vegas
cause somebody told me
thats where dreams would be
gonna sell my car and go to vegas
finally see my name upon the palace marquee
gonna quit my job and move to new york
cause somebody told me thats where
dreamers should go
gonna quit my job and move to new york
and tattoo my body with every broadway show

listen up now honey youre gonna be sorry
cant get out from under a sky that is falling
and you say

the way im running has sure got me down
on my knees

and make sweet love upon the white sandy shore

verse 3
its always just around the corner or youre
on your way to somewhere
that is bigger or better
if you could only get there
its never your fault you cant start your
own winning streak
but id hate to lose you to the fortune you seek
im gonna lose my mind and sail the ocean
cause somebody told me there were
cherry blue skies
im gonna fix my mind with a final destination
and have a deep sleep upon a sweet dream
ill never realizeno
