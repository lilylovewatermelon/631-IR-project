verse
sometimes i feel like i dont belong anywhere
and its gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
sometimes i feel so heavy hearted
but i cant explain cause im so guarded
but thats a lonely road to travel
and a heavy load to bear
and its a long long way to heaven
but i gotta get there
can you send an angel
can you send me an angel
to guide me
