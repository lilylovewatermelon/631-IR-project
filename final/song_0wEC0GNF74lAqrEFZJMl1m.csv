ayo
i wanna talk i wanna call you and talk
i wanna walk to your front door and knock
after i start my vehicle
drive to your city cause we live an hour apart
land at your driveway and put it in park
then do the third line of this verse
then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
and we ride through the park chase the sun
god thats all i want other than air
oxygen and financial freedom yeah
i want your company i need your company
i want you to want from me
i cant maneuver without you next to me
its so complex to me

verse 2 tyler the creator
what do you need
do you need bread do you need this
do you need a hug do you need to be alone
i could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
what is your wish it can be granted
