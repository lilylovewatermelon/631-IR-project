depression
a real street nigga but i got depression
a lot of things really left my feelings hurtin
just wanna please everybody im not perfect
i tried to do right and be your stepping stone
but you aint do right you even did me wrong
and i dont know which world that im standing on
i just wanna be left in the room with microphones
my dad held me on the couch when mike was on
your feelings get hurt and then you get your typing on
i miss my nigga you just know he got indicted oh

ima kill em ima kill em ima kill em
and ima get three motherfuckin rid of
