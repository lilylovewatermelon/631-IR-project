suppose i called you up tonight and told you that i love you
and suppose i said i wanna come back home
and suppose i cried and said i think ive finally learned my lesson
and im tired of spendin all my time alone

verse 2
if i told you that i realized youre all i ever wanted
and its killin me to be so far away
would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
or would you simply laugh at me and say

chorus
i told you so oh i told you so
i told you some day youd come crawlin back and askin me to take you in
i told you so but you had to go
now ive found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

verse 3
if i got down on my knees and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours too and take my hand
would we get that old time feelin would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began

verse 4
would you tell me that youve missed me too and that youve been so lonely
and youve waited for the day that i returned
and wed live and love forever and that im your one and only
or would you say the tables finally turned

would you say i told you so oh i told you so
i told you some day youd come crawlin back and askin me to take you in
