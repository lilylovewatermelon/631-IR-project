i present the death of the cool

verse 1 lupe fiasco
die well i heard like groups of cows
that all your enemies wanna shoot you down
they got ak47s and a bunch of mac11s
semiautomatic weapons that produce kapows
word on the street is they all got heaters
they gon hit you up you aint even gonna see it
you got a lot of money i aint tryna be funny
but they say where you goin you aint even gonna need it
die i seen you ridin round shinin with your fine round
diamonds pretty greeneyed lady
been on the sideline plottin while you primetime poppin
hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
i suggest you protect your bakery
cause they comin for your head
and theres a bounty on the chain
thats hangin from your neck you see

chorus lupe fiasco
i dont know what you been told
in your ear but i hear its goin down
somebody gotta die
know oh what you been told in your ear
but heres whats goin round
somebody gotta die

and keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet

ak in the trunk where the sounds bump
two twin glock 40s and a 9 in his damn crotch
