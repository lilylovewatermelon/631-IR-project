you took me to your little crib
guess it must have been a big deal a big deal
got me starring in your wet dream
now its time to get real get real
im not looking for love
no not today
but you call me up and had the nerve to say
see you next tuesday
chorus
you call me a bitch like its a bad thing
you call me a freak like that means something
cant get your way so youre sulking
i think we know the rest
get it off your chest
i dont give a shit
i love it when you call me a bitch like its a bad thing
like its a bad thing

verse 2
you show up everywhere i go
get a grip youre acting so weird so weird
i dont need your jägerbombs
i think i can take it from here from here
you gotta learn to leave when the party ends
i dont really care what you tell your friends
tell me again

i think you hate me cause you want me
