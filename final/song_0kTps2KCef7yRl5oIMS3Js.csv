my divorce from dependence
thats when you found me
i was still soft
and we always were in trouble
odds stacked against us
and troubles what we are

chorus
we get so far
and then it just starts rewinding
and the same old song were playing it again
suspension without suspense

verse 2
now that ive murdered your inspiration
and i forced you off
do you hate me
do you want revenge
i want to call you
but i wont

chorus
we get so far
and then it just starts rewinding
and the same old song were playing it again
suspension without suspense
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likebridge
oh the pessimistic protection plan
moderation loving
ive been hardened by the circumstance
we knew this was coming

chorus
we get so far
and then it just starts rewinding
and the same old song were playing it again
suspension without suspense
oh we get so far
and then it just starts rewinding
and the same old song were playing it again and again
suspension without suspense

outro
intentions without intent
but i dont want the love we have to end1embed"
