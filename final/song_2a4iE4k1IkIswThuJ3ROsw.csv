and i hate to say i love you
when its so hard for me
and i hate to say i want you
when you make it so clear
you dont want me

chorus
id never ask you cause deep down
im certain i know what youd say
youd say im sorry believe me i love you
but not in that way

verse 2
and i hate to say i need you
im so reliant im so dependent im such a fool
when youre not there i find myself singing the blues
cant bear cant face the truth

bridge
you will never know that feeling
you will never see through these eyes

chorus
id never ask you cause deep down
im certain i know what youd say
youd say im sorry believe me i love you
but not in that way
