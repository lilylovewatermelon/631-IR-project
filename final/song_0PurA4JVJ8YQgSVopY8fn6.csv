i sit and watch you readin with your head low
i wake and watch you breathin with your eyes closed

i wait by the door like im just a kid
use my best colors for your portrait
lay the table with the fancy shit
and watch you tolerate it
if its all in my head tell me now
tell me ive got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it

but you tolerate it
