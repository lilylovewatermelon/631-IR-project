now youre gone
i wonder why
you left me here
i think about it on and on and on and on and on again
i know youre never coming back
i hope that you can hear me
im waiting to hear from you
until i do

prechorus
youre gone away
im left alone
a part of me is gone and im not moving on
so wait for me
i know the day will come

chorus
ill meet you there
no matter where life takes me to
ill meet you there
and even if i need you here
ill meet you there

verse 2
i wish i could have told you
the things i kept inside
but now i guess its just too late
so many things remind me of you
i hope that you can hear me
i miss you
this is goodbye
one last time
