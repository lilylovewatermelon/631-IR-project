how was i to know its a crazy thing
i showed you my hand and you still let me win
and who was i to say that this was meant to be
the road that was broken brought us together

chorus
and i know you could fall for a thousand kings
and hearts that would give you a diamond ring
when i fold you see the best in me
the joker and the queen

verse 2
i was upside down from the outside in
you came to the table and you went all in
with a single word and a gentle touch
you turned a moment into forever

chorus
and i know you could fall for a thousand kings
and hearts that could give you a diamond ring
when i fold you see the best in me
the joker and the queen
