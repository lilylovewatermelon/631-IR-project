verse 2 spooky da scary
i have become what i hate
sad to say i saw this coming from miles away
too bad that it aint a race
coughing my lungs out stuck in last place
always in bad shape blunt to the face
i want all the smoke let me get a fucking taste
what the fuck you gotta say yung plague untamed
yung plague got nothing to hide
now ive never been one for pickin sides
but i choose uicide
yeah i reject almost everything bout this new world
i reject all the people inside fuck em
they can run they can hide
they can swim they can fly
but ill hunt em day and night
for the rest of my life just to watch em die
then shed tears like a crocodile
all the while my choppa smiles
bite the bullet thats not my style
belly full of lead and stomach bile
you thought that your life would be worthwhile
just another fucking rankandfile bitch
first came school then you got a job
now your fucking bitch is walking down the aisle
safe neighborhood for the domicile
redoing the kitchen picking out new tiles ayy
dont touch that fucking dial ayy
lets see whats on tv
world war iii in a couple hours ayy
but at least the house is clean ayy
bodies will be piled for miles and miles
but the maid service was free uh15embed"
