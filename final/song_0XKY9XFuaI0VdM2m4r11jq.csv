hallelujah thank god i have a future
prayin i dont waste it gettin faded
cause im smokin  until im coughin up tar
feel the surge energy curve like a lumbar
i dont act hard i still read babar
trippin out lookin at a bunch of google map stars
shit they got a app for that

verse 1 mac miller
but me im still trapped inside my head
it kinda feel like its a purgatory
so polite and white but i got family who would murder for me
think im livin paradise so what i have to worry bout
dealin with these demons feel the pressure find the perfect style perfect style
makin sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
all these backfires of my experiments with drugs
and i experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
difference between love and war inform me im above the norm above the norm
give me anybody though ill gladly chew his face off them bath salts
rhymin like its summertime on asphalt hot
havent picked a major label think im blackballed
i still dont got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
will he recognize his son when he hears my voice
i put this music gainst my life i think i fear the choice
and i dont know what im runnin from but im runnin still
i conversate with acquaintances but its nothin real
im from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
so a hundred mills wouldnt make me sign a fuckin deal fuckin deal
money kills thats the truth its called the root of evil
but i want that rollsroyce that the homie lennon drove
so if you dont talk about some money ima send you home
unconventional special but unprofessional
adolescent expression thats lettin me meet these centerfolds
as troubles fill my mind capacity i let em go let em go
if i was johnny depp in blow i would let it snow would let it slow
thats just me all wildin out and bein extra though extra though
yeah

and if god was a human itd be yours truly
watchin horror movies with some foreign groupies
thinkin this decor suits me this decor suits me
i do drugs get more loopy
im in tune to ancient jiujitsu spirituals its blissful its blissful
lookin out as far as eyes can see
im glad that me and this elevation could finally meet could finally meet
i think im jfks final speech
they try assassinatin all of my beliefs
but im asleep so whisper to me for the peace of mind
and he be high some weed to grind on top a jesus shrine shrine
twenty thousand on my watch cause i needed time
if yall would leave me the fuck alone thatd be divine be divine
yeah cant decide if you like all the fame
three years ago to now its just not the same not the same
im lookin out my window ashin on the pane ashin on the pane
shit wonder if i lost my way lost my way

verse 3 delusional thomas
yeah dont you ever wanna hide away hide away
poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
wont give a fuck about tomorrow if i die today die today
ill greet the devil with a smilin face smilin face
shit that god fellow may reside in space
as times are wastin im freebasin with freemasons
my girls switchin the locks the keys keep changin keep changin
dreamin of places my own personal creations
if theres a party in heaven i plan to leave wasted leave wasted
retracin my steps way back to biblical times
wewe all gon end up meetin at the finishin line
outro mac miller
and these words that i command you today shall be in your heart
and you shall teach them diligently to your children
and you shall speak of them when you sit at home
and when you walk along the way and when you lie down
and when you rise up i am the lord your god86embed"
