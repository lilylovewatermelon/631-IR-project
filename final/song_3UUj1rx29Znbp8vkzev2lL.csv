well i miss college station
them boys were good to me
well i burned north gate down
i been the life of the party
i seen that twelve man town
through a tailgate sea

chorus
the road goes on
i cant stay long
i got sights to see

verse 2
i raised hell in the panhandle
lived young wild and free
northern winds kicked my rear end
and got the best of me
found myself stuck in lubbock
playin my songs for free

chorus
but the road goes on
i cant stay long
i got sights to see
see flatland cavalry liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeverse 2
the miles i traveled down these roads
still recall the heart i broke
yes runnin away never got me over you
because the truth
sometimes this road gets lonesome
and i wonder how you been
i cant help but think youre probably
somewhere better off with him
but if you ever hear my songs
and you still love me

darlin hurry home
we cant stay long
we got sights to see

i said oh oh
i said oh oh
said ohembed"
