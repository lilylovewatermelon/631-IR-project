no no shapes at all
nothing real or artificial
no time be no change
no colours to rearrange

i get that feeling
when were apart oh
i get the teaching that i cant be without you
without you babe
without you

no future there is no past
no slow there is no fast
no grace with which to admire
no face there is no desire
no symmetry or peace
no sirens or police
no cameras and no phones
no photographs and no tones

and i
i get that feeling
when were apart oh
i get the teaching that i cant be without you
without you babe
without you

i get that feeling
when were apart oh
i get the teaching that i cant be without you
