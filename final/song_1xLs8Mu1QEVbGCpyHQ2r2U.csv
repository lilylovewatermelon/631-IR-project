yeah

chorus
you ever wonder whyyyyy why
whyyyyy whyyyyy
you ever wonder whyyyyy why
whyyyyy whyyyyy

verse 1
said the lady with the long legs in the lawn chair
she like the strings on my guitar neck and my blonde hair
i write about her thighs in my latest lines
i remember her eyes when i asked her why
why would you pay for this apartment you dont belong in
you take this shit from all your bosses and all your boyfriends
i guess i get surprised when you let it slide
but its no business of mine how you waste your time
yeah

verse 2
dont crash dont text go renew your tags
no sex no sleep just that job
i bet you miss what you had
you cant get no sleep at night
do you ever wonder why everyone is out to get you every day
or do you question anything
how many warnin signs til it hits you darling
gravitys your friend
you fall out of touch sometime
but your history calls you back to it again
too many factors to be sure
so many reasons to think twice
and nobody asked you to before
