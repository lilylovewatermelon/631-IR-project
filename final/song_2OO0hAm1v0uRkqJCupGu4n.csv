all work no play may have made jack a dull boy
but all work no god has left jack with a lost soul
but hes moving on full steam
hes chasing the american dream
and hes gonna give his family the finer things

verse 2
not this time son ive no time to waste
maybe tomorrow well have time to play
and then he slips into his new bmw
and drives farther and farther and farther away
cause he works all day and tries to sleep at night
he says things will get better
better in time

chorus
so he works and he builds with his own two hands
and he pours all he has in a castle made with sand
but the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
his kingdom stands

verse 3
his american dream is beginning to seem
more and more like a nightmare
with every passing day
daddy can you come to my game
oh baby please dont work late
another wasted weekend
and they are slipping away
cause he works all day and lies awake at night
he tells them things will get better
itll just take a little more time
see casting crowns liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likechorus
so he works and he builds with his own two hands
and he pours all he has in a castle made with sand
but the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
his kingdom stands

bridge
he used to say whoever dies with the most toys wins
but if he loses his soul what has he gained in the end
ill take a shack on the rock
over a castle in the sand
now he works all day and cries alone at night
its not getting any better
looks like hes running out of time

chorus
cause he worked and he built with his own two hands
and he poured all he had in a castle made with sand
but the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
his kingdom stands

outro
all they really wanted was you
all they really wanted was you
all they really wanted was you1embed"
