spring break 88
she came in to hear my band play
and man we were on that night
twin guitars and 20minute jams
tush cocaine and sweet home alabam
i knew i had her in the palm of my hand
when i stepped in the spotlight
hotnheavy in that little alley
on a fifteen minute break
we shared a cigarette long kiss
then she stood there by the stage
all night by the stage
what can i say
she loved me

but after five long years of trying to be a star
i sold my acts and i quit them bars
got a real job fixing trucks and cars
had a couple new mouths to feed
and eventually that monthly wage
and the finer points of the suburban age
all became bars on a cage
and man it was killing me
i started cussin and getting mad at nothin
and blaming her for ruining my life
started sinking cheating and adrinking
but she stood there by my side
right there by my side
with tears in her eyes
you might also likeand she loved me
she loved me
heaven knows the reasons why
ill never know the reasons why
she loved me

she finally left three years ago
married a man out in new mexico
calls to say the boys are really growing
god i miss them kids
as for me im twelve steps down the line
i found a church that i like just fine
even got a gig playing these songs of mine
they all just reminisce

hotnheavy in that little alley
on a fifteen minute break
we shared a cigarette long kiss
then she stood there by the stage
all night by the stage
man those were the days
when she loved me

yeah she loved me
heaven knows the reasons why
ill never know the reasons why
she loved me
yeah she loved me
heaven knows the reasons why
ill never know the reasons why
she loved meembed"
