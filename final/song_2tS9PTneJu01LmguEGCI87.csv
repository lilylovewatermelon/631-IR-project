it flows underneath the 32 bridge
and cuts through the heart of south georgia
big copperheads and mean wild pigs
and gators in the weeds waiting for ya
i leave my phone in the truck
i leave my truck at the road
my fourwheeler gets me where i wanna go
i leave the world behind
i pull my hat down low
get back to my roots by a full moon glow

hook
i got an old jon boat that i stowed down there
on them hot summer nights when i get awild hare
i got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
and a catfish line going  bump bump
an old tractor tire where i sit by the fire
and drink to a sweet swamp song
so if youre looking for me dont even bother
when i dip my feet in that muckalee creek water

verse 2
daddy brought me down here when i was a kid
taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
from the time i was old enough to walk
he had me running down squirrels and rabbits
i feel right at home in this neck of the woods
if this was all i had id be living good
so let the stock market do what its gonna do
let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

i got an old jon boat that i stowed down there
on them hot summer nights when i get awild hare
i got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
and a catfish line going  bump bump
an old tractor tire where i sit by the fire
and drink to a sweet swamp song
so if youre looking for me dont even bother
when i dip my feet in that muckalee creek water

bridge
im free and im me
being everything that i wanna be
nobody jacking with me
no sign of the city lights
hell with the city lights

hook
i got an old jon boat that i stowed down there
on them hot summer nights when i get awild hare
i got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
and a catfish line going  bump bump bump
an old tractor tire where i sit by the fire
and drink to a sweet swamp song
so if youre looking for me dont even holler
when i get down deep in that muckalee creek water
that muckalee creek waterembed"
