one
laughing
one two one two three

verse 1
well it was ugly but we made it this far
some have gone but i forget who they are
now the hangovers are worse but we get through them fine

hook
sleeping late but were not lazy
getting older but were still crazy
im so glad that i have these friends o mine

verse 2
it started out at a coffee shop in a most unlikely town
and there were casualties but we made it out anyhow
we stuck together through the good and bad times
pulp fiction blazing saddles and fast times
im so glad that i have these friends o mine
solo

bridge
and jobs girls and obstacles did all but break us down
night clubs and broken bands in every major town
well ive got your back youve got mine
like johnny cash said i walk the line
and you can always count on me for one last beer
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeverse 3
we saw the world and the world seemed smaller
were getting wider but not getting no taller
i know weve grown up just a little at a time

hook
were sleeping late but were not lazy
were getting older but were still crazy
im so glad that i have these friends o mine

outro
so glad that i have these friends o mine
so glad that i have these friends o mineembed"
