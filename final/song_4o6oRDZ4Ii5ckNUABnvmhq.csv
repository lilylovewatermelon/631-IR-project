she told him shed rather fix her makeup
than try to fix whats going on
but the problem keeps on calling
even with the cellphone gone
she told him that she believes in living
bigger than shes living now
but her world keeps spinning backwards
and upside down
dont say so long and throw yourself wrong
dont spend today away
cause today will soon be

chorus
gone like yesterday is gone
like history is
gone just trying to prove me wrong
and pretend like youre immortal

verse 2
she said he said live like no tomorrow
every day we borrow
brings us one step closer to the edge infinity
wheres your treasure wheres your hope
if you get the world and lose your soul
she pretends like she pretends like shes immortal
dont say so long
youre not that far gone
this could be your big chance to makeup
today will soon be
you might also likechorus
gone like yesterday is gone
like history is gone
the world keeps spinning on
youre going going gone
like summer break is gone
like saturday is gone
just try to prove me wrong
you pretend like youre immortal youre immortal
youre immortal youre immortal

bridge
we are not infinite
we are not permanent
nothing is immediate
were so confident
in our accomplishments
look at our decadence

outro
gone like frank sinatra
like elvis and his mom
like al pacinos cash nothing lasts in this life
my high school dreams are gone
my childhood sweets are gone
life is a day that doesnt last for long
life is more than money
time was never money
time was never cash
life is still more than girls
life is more than hundred dollar bills
and rototom fills
lifes more than fame and rock and roll and thrills
all the riches of the kings end up in wills
we got information in the information age
but do we know what life is
outside of our convenient lexus cages
she said he said live like no tomorrow
every moment that we borrow
brings us closer to the god whos not short of cash
hey bono im glad you asked
life is still worth living life is still worth living
life is more than you are3embed"
