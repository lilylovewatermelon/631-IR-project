up and down that lonely road of faith
i have been there
unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise
ive realized one thing how much i love you
and it hurts to see see you crying
i believe we can make it through the winds of change

verse 2
god is great indeed
if you believe in the everlife
yeah we got to
make some sense of the piece thats not defined
and if you just hold on i wont let ya fall
we can make it through the storms and the winds of change

though i walk through the valley of darkness
i am not afraid
because i know im not alone

verse 3
and if the wind blows east would you follow me
and if the wind blows north would you stay your course
and if the wind blows west would you second guess
and if it blows to the south would you count me out
and if the sun dont shine would you still be mine
and if the sky turns grey would you walk away
would you say i do if i say ill be
and walk this road through life with me
you know i love youuu
