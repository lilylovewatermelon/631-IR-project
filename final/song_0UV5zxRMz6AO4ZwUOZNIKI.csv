above the clouds were cliffs
above the clouds were cliffs
above the clouds were cliffs
love moves through me
and into the abyss

verse 1
whered all the time go
its starting to fly
see how the hands go
waving goodbye
and you know i get so forgetful
when i look in your eyes

verse 2
now shes walking backwards shes walking backwards
through a parade
and im stuck in the shadow stuck in the shadow
blocking the shade
and there aint no way to sweep up ooh
the mess that weve made

chorus
she gets dressed up like a pillow so shes always in bed
flowers for the sick and dead
shes on the go way too fast and way too slow
shell turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
and when the fog rises
somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeverse 3
theres nothing to keep you nothing to keep you
from falling in love
it starts at the bottom starts at the bottom
and comes from above
like pieces of a puzzle
like a hand in a glove

chorus
she gets dressed up like a pillow so shes always in bed
flowers for the sick and dead
shes on the go way too fast and way too slow
shell turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes
and when the tide rises
somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye
woo woo

outro
somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye17embed"
