verse 2 daisy
ah i used to wanna be normal
i used to lay out the labels and pray that one of them stuck
i used to beat myself up but its too abstract to scratch past
so i aint asking for an answer like that no no
im over hoping for a box to check a giant past to connect
i argued with myself over breakfast yeah
i scavenge my mind but she rides in spirals counter to clockwise
ill be your passenger when youre too distracted to drive
and ill be your lover if you think youre down for the ride
aint got a preference a wifey or a boyfriend
or something inbetween we dont need no categories

chorus steve lacy  daisy
