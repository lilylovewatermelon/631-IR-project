no crickets no creatures are astirring
on the last night of the chinese year
i need a warm hand over the water
ever since i lost mine in the fireworks disaster
and i lay up wide awake

refrain
going to take my life
going to take my life back one day

verse 2
now im watching you changing in the mirror
and i unable to move
when all my girlfriends appear in the doorway
i dont know how they got here
i dont know what to say about this
and they all go that way

refrain
going to take my life
going to take my life back one dayyou might also likeembed"
