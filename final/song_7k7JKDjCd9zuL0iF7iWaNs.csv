oh the way that you dance on me makes me not wanna leave
you wanna go upstairs but you dont wanna sleep
oh right now were in a rhythm
your boyfriends no competition
turn off your phone and blame it on your battery hey

prechorus
ohohohoh
were getting real real close
ohohohoh
cant let this moment go

chorus
hands on your body like theres no one at the party
just me and you and these empty cups
if you wanna like i wanna
let me take you to another room
so its only us
turn that television up so nobody can listen
hands on your body like theres no one at the party
just me and you and these empty cups

verse 2
ooh girl do you think theyll notice if we slip away
maybe tomorrow theyll all have something to say
