this song goes out to my good friends
especially the ones i had
before the grammy nominations in two thousand three
and to all the girls from back in high school
who actually spoke to me
even though i was a fat kid and a marching band geek
i hope this song finds you well
and i hope that youre doin fuckin swell
i hope that youre back up if youve ever been down
and i hope you got the fuck out of our hometown
here comes a shout out to the professor
who saidson pick a path and stay the same
cause charisma is the key to opportunity
and to all the clubs that let us play
to our family and friends and the music stores
for giving us gear when we couldnt pay
i hope this song finds you well
and i hope that youre doin fuckin swell
i hope that youre back up if youve ever been down
aaa
and i hope you got the fuck out of our hometown
you know i cant count
how many times ive heard people say
be proud of where youre from youre gonna put us on the map
but where the hell were you back in the day
no one came to see us so we got the hell out of there
so there
you have a de de de de de de de
this song goes out to my big brother
for putting up with me following you around
and for making me smile when things at home werent great
and for not getting pissed when i humped your girlfriend
for letting me take your car to the prom
for beating up the guys that hung my bike in a tree
for hand me down albums and guitar with no strings
and for never beating the shit outta me
i hope this song finds you well
and i hope that youre doin fuckin swell
i hope that youre back up cause i know youve been down
i just wish youd get the fuck out of our hometown
i hope you get the fuck out of our hometown
im so glad i got the fuck out of our hometown
you know what im talkin about
