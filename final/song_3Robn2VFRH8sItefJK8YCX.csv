lord i offer up this rebel heart
so stubborn and so restless from the start
i dont wanna fight you anymore
so take this rebel heart and make it yours

verse 2
father i no longer wanna run
youve broken my resistance with your love
and drowned it underneath the crimson spill
so bend this rebel heart into your will

chorus
i give it all over to you
i give it all over to you
your love is like an arrow straight and true
and now this rebel heart belongs to you

verse 3
help me lay the renegade to rest
turn the stone inside me back to flesh
and hold me til my best defenses fall
and watch this rebel heart surrender all

chorus
i give it all over to you
i give it all over to you
your love is like an arrow straight and true
and now this rebel heart belongs to you
