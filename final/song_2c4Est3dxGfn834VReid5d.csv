you should know you should know you should know
you should know by now
what they say what they say what they say
when youre not around
and a little girl should be careful
but whos gonna make her
when those boys start playing too rough
well whos gonna save her ooh

chorus
remember your safeword
remember your safeword
remember your safeword ooh
remember your safeword

verse 2
and its a dull dull world
where you need to manufacture some action
shell take you home tie you up and slap ya
without even askin
and all the clamps and whips in los angeles
couldnt faze her
so if you really wanna see her in pain
just wait until later ooh

remember your safeword
remember your safeword
remember your safeword ooh

verse 3
and if everything could come to a stop
just from something she says
i thought the whole point was you were living on the edge
so when those sounds start to drift down the halls
and start to freak out the neighbors
remember that its good clean fun
just wholesome delinquent behavior ooh

chorus
remember your safeword
remember your safeword
remember your safeword ooh
remember your safeword
remember your safeword
remember your safeword8embed"
