the state of the nation â€“ violation
a broken promise is as good as a lie
the hell is humongous the devils among us
and we will burn cause we wont unite
what are we conceding for our freedom
why does anybody think we need em
i would rather fight than let another die
were the problem but were also the solution
all hope is gone
if you want it come and take it from me
if you think you can you still dont know me
let me tell you man if i said it i meant it
and i will always have the right to defend it
fifty seconds a hundred murders
the bill of rights is a bill of sale
what will you do when the war is over
what will you do when your system fails

chorus corey taylor corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
we have made the present obsolete
what do you want what do you need
well find a way when all hope is gone
weve seen the fall of the elite
bury your life take your disease
well end the world when all hope is gone

chorus corey taylor corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
we have made the present obsolete
what do you want what do you need
well find a way when all hope is gone
weve seen the fall of the elite
bury your life take your disease
well end the world when all hope is gone

verse 2 corey taylor
the wretched are the wounded
the hungry starve to death
in a place where no one goes
the air itself is a final breath
so discontinue the antiseptic care charade
as a cry of justice comes a malignant fire fades
i am the reason your future suffers
i am the hatred you wont embrace
i am the worm of a pure gestation
i am the remedy spit in my face
all your laws and rules are outdated
all your subjects are killing the kings
i can rattle off a million other reasons why
but does it matter when the only thing we love will die
chorus corey taylor corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
we have made the present obsolete
what do you want what do you need
well find a way when all hope is gone
weve seen the fall of the elite
bury your life take your disease
well end the world when all hope is gone

chorus corey taylor corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
we have made the present obsolete
what do you want what do you need
well find a way well find a way when all hope is gone
weve seen the fall of the elite
bury your life take your disease
well end the world well end the world when all hope is gone

outro corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
when all hope is gone
when all hope is gone
