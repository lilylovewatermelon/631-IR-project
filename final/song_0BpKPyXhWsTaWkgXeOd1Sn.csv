intro
sister im not much a poet but a criminal
and you never had a chance
love it or leave it you cant understand a pretty face
but you do so carry on and on and on

verse 1
i wouldnt front the scene if you paid me
im just the way that the doctor made me
on and on and on and on
love is the red the rose on your coffin door
whats life like bleeding on the floor the floor the floor

prechorus
youll never make me leave i wear this on my sleeve
give me a reason to believe

chorus
so give me all your poison and give me all your pills
and give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
youre running after something that youll never kill
if this is what you want then fire at will

verse 2
preach all you want but whos gonna save me
i keep a gun on the book you gave me
hallelujah lock and load
black is the kiss the touch of a serpent son
it aint the mark or the scar that makes you one and one and one and one

chorus
so give me all your poison and give me all your pills
and give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
youre running after something that youll never kill
if this is what you want then fire at will
