i think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
for they crown they head is cut off bodies is laid

but crystals single bonnies broke and her niggas too ha

verse 3
you cant be me im trying to walk a straight line

to represent the streets youll see that my plan
is not to destroy your man
but to bring more to mankind and teach
every mc reach for your pens and papers

cause soon youll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
and understand to battle nas not in your plan

and you my offspring the boss sting
a bulletproof porsche things hard for you to understand that
