seems that i have been held in some dreaming state
a tourist in the waking world never quite awake
no kiss no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
until i realize that it was you who held me under

prechorus 1
felt it in my fist in my feet in the hollows of my eyelids
shaking through my skull through my spine and down through my ribs

chorus 1
no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

verse 2
and i could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack
all around the world was waking i never could go back
because all the walls of dreaming they were torn wide open
and finally it seemed that the spell was broken

prechorus 2
and all my bones began to shake my eyes flew open
and all my bones began to shake my eyes flew open

no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

chorus 2
snow white is stitching up your circuitboards
synapse slipping through the hidden door
snow white is stitching up your circuitboard

chorus 1
no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

snow whites stitching up your circuitboards
synapse slipping through the hidden door
