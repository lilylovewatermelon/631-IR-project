it goes a one two three

verse 1 mike shinoda
i was born with the hunger of a lion the strength of a sun
i dont need to sweat it when a competition come
original style like an 808 drum
so i dont run the track no i make the track run
my mama taught me words my daddy built rockets
i put em both together now tell me what i got its
a pretty smart weapon i can shoot it i can drop it
but learn to respect it cause you clearly cant stop it like that

verse 2 mike shinoda
it aint over cause the sharks on the left side the snakes on the right
and anything you do they wanna get a little bite
it really doesnt matter if youre wrong or if youre right
cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
and as for me i do it like i got nothing to lose
and you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
but steady little soldier i aint standin next to you
id be layin on the ground before youre even in my view like that

bridge chester bennington
give me the strength of the rising sun
give me the truth of the words unsung
and when the last bells ring the poor men sing
bring me to kingdom come

its something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
give me what you need like poppa who shot you
separate the weak from the obsolete
youre meek i creep hard on impostors
and switch styles on a dime quickwitted
yall quit trippin i dont have time for your cryin
i grind tough sucker make your mind up
are you in the firin squad or are you in the lineup
bang bang little monkey man playin with the big guns
only get you slain i aint playin im just sayin
you aint got a sliver of a chance
i get iller i deliver while you quiver in your pants
so shake shake down money heres the breakdown
you can play the bank imma play the bank takedown
and no mistakes now im comin to get you
im just a banksy youre a brainwash
get the picture its like that

outro brad delson
we swim against the rising waves
and crash against the shore
the body bends until it breaks
the early morning sings no more
so rest your head its time to sleep
and dream of whats in store
the body bends until it breaks
and sings again no more
cause time has torn the flesh away
the early morning sings no more8embed"
