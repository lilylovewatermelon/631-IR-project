verse 1
hey mister where you headed
are you in a hurry
need a lift to happy hour say oh no
do you brake for distilled spirits
i need a break as well
the well that inebriates the guilt
one two one two three four

and im dehydrated
my tongue is swellin up i say
one two one two three four

im off the wagon and im hitchin a ride
