walking scott street feeling like a stranger
with an open heart open container
ive got a stack of mail and a tall can
its a shower beer its a payment plan
theres helicopters over my head
every night when i go to bed
spending money and i earned it
when im lonely thats when ill burn it

chorus
do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name
verse 2
i asked you how is your sister
i heard she got her degree
and i said that makes me feel old
you said what does that make me
i asked you how is playing drums
said its too much shit to carry
and what about the band
you said theyre all gettin married

chorus
do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name
