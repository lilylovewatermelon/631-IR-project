a lonely road crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find
while i recall all the words you spoke to me
cant help but wish that i was there
at where id love to be oh yeah

chorus
dear god the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when im not around
when im much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish id stayed
cause im lonely and im tired
im missing you again oh no
once again

verse 2
theres nothing here for me on this barren road
theres no one here while the city sleeps
and all the shops are closed
cant help but think of the times ive had with you
pictures and some memories will have to help me through oh yeah

chorus
dear god the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when im not around
when im much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish id stayed
cause im lonely and im tired
im missing you again oh no
once again

some search never finding a way
before long they waste away
i found you something told me to stay
i gave in to selfish ways
and how i miss someone to hold
when hope begins to fade

refrain
a lonely road crossed another cold state line
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find

chorus
dear god the only thing i ask of you
is to hold her when im not around
when im much too far away
we all need that person who can be true to you
but i left her when i found her
and now i wish id stayed
cause im lonely and im tired
im missing you again oh no
once again33embed"
