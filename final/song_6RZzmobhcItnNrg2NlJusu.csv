i dont know who i am
staring at a million broken pieces here
i dont know where i stand
while im still the world goes round so free so cavalier
aimlessly i wander like a drifter
on a narrow winding road
ive got plenty of direction but i dont know where to go

chorus
im so lost without you
im so lost without you
baby im so lost without you
that i cant find myself

verse 2
no it dont seem right this canyon of lonely lying in our bed
lord how ive cried a waterfall of tears until my eyes turn red
ever since you left me its been like a bullet through my heart
and i know i should move on but i dont know where to start

chorus
im so lost without you
im so lost without you
baby im so lost without you
that i cant find myselfyou might also likeembed"
