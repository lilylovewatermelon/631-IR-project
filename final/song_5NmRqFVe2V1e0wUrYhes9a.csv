verse 1 the game
gangsta gangsta thats already evident

im ruthless i aint talkin bout the label
ill hook niggas up and i dont mean free cable

verse 3 the game
ive been rappin for one year one month 17 days
13 hours 28 minutes then i met dre
30 minutes after i bought the new em
that was november 18th 309 pm
around the same time wanksta got its first spin
that was 32 weeks before they signed rakim
eight months 13 days before i knew a mike len
and three years after mason betha turned his mic in
i started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
to lebron shakin adidas for nikes
im right here six years after randy moss
caught his first touchdown for the vikings
just one day seven hours 14 minutes
21 seconds before soundscan got printed
two platinum records fore im classified with biggie
and two seconds before the song finish yeah
