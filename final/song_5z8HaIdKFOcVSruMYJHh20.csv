feeling like this could only mean im sinking
feeling like this could only mean im sinking
well im sinking pull me out

chorus
every time i see your clothes scattered out on the floor
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
every time i see the light not burning on the porch
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
but you are you are

verse 2
feeling overwhelmed i take a dive
into once overfilled but now empty place to hide
the day you turned on me is the day i died
and ive forgotten what its like
and how it feels to be alive

chorus
every time i see your clothes scattered out on the floor
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
every time i see the light not burning on the porch
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
but you are you are
see daughtry liveget tickets as low as 158you might also likebridge
reach up to the sky
when nothing seems to go right
when nothing seems to go right for me

chorus
every time i see your clothes scattered out on the floor
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
every time i see the light not burning on the porch
i say i thought you would be home
you said you never would be gone
but you are you areembed"
