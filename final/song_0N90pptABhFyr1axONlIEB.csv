stop stalling make a name for yourself
boy you better put that pen to paper and charm your way out
if you talk you better walk you better back your shit up
with more than good hooks while youre all under the gun
start talking a sensationalist
oh hes slightly clever to just a certain extent
if you talk you better walk you better keep your mouth shut
with more than good hooks while youre all under the gun

prechorus
panic meet the press
its time for us to take a chance
its time for us to take a chance
panic meet the press
its time for us to take a chance
its time for us

chorus
well were just a wet dream for the webzine
make us it make us hip make us scene
or shrug us off your shoulders
dont approve a single word that we wrote
well were just a wet dream for the webzine
make us it make us hip make us scene
or shrug us off your shoulders
dont approve a single word that we wrote

im burning and im blacking my lungs
boy you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue
if you talk you better walk you better back your shit up
with more than good hooks while youre all under the gun
start talking a sensationalist
oh hes slightly clever to just a certain extent
well keep quiet let us sing like the doves
then decide if its done with purpose or lack thereof

interlude
just for the record the weather today
is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
a indifference or b disinterest
in what the critics say

prechorus
its time for us to take a chance
its time for us
