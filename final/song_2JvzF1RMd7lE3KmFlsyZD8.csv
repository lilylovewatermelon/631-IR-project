you good tminus

refrain
niggas been countin me out
i’m countin my bullets im loadin’ my clips
im writin down names im makin a list
im checkin it twice and im gettin’ ’em hit
the real ones been dyin the fake ones is lit
the game is off balance i’m back on my shit
the bentley is dirty my sneakers is dirty
but thats how i like it you all on my dick

verse 1
im all in my bag this hard as it get
i do not snort powder i might take a sip
i might hit the blunt but im liable to trip
i ain’t poppin no pill but you do as you wish
i roll with some fiends i love em to death
i got a few mil but not all of them rich
what good is the bread if my niggas is broke
what good is first class if my niggas cant sit
thats my next mission thats why i cant quit
just like lebron get my niggas more chips
just put the rollie right back on my wrist
this watch came from drizzy he gave me a gift
back when the rap game was prayin id diss
they act like two legends cannot coexist
but id never beef with a nigga for nothin
if i smoke a rapper its gon be legit
it wont be for clout it wont be for fame
it wont be cause my shit aint sellin the same
it wont be to sell you my latest lil sneakers
it wont be cause some nigga slid in my lane
everything grows its destined to change
i love you lil niggas im glad that you came
i hope that you scrape every dollar you can
i hope you know money wont erase the pain
to the ogs im thankin you now
was watchin you when you was pavin the ground
i copied your cadence i mirrored your style
i studied the greats im the greatest right now
fuck if you feel me you aint got a choice
i aint do no promo still made all that noise
this year gon be different i set my intentions
i promise to slap all that hate out your voice
you might also likerefrain
niggas been countin me out
im countin my bullets im loadin my clips
im writin down names im makin a list
im checkin it twice and im gettin em hit
the real ones been dyin the fake ones is lit
the game is off balance im back on my shit
the bentley is dirty my sneakers is dirty
but thats how i like it you all on my dick

chorus
i just poured somethin in my cup
ive been wantin somethin i can feel
promise i am never lettin up
money in your palm dont make you real
foot is on they neck i got em stuck
ima give em somethin they can feel
if it aint bout the squad dont give a fuck
pistol in your hand dont make you real

verse 2
im dead in the middle of two generations
im little bro and big bro all at once
just left the lab with young 21 savage
im bout to go and meet jigga for lunch
had a long talk with the young nigga kodak
reminded me of young niggas from ville
straight out the projects no fakin just honest
i wish that he had more guidance for real
too many niggas in cycle of jail
spending they birthdays inside of a cell
we coming from a long bloodline of trauma
we raised by our mamas lord we gotta heal
we hurting our sisters the babies as well
we killing our brothers they poisoned the well
distorted selfimage we set up to fail
ima make sure that the real gon prevail nigga
chorus
i just poured somethin in my cup
ive been wantin somethin i can feel
promise i am never lettin up
money in your palm dont make you real
foot is on they neck i got em stuck
ima give em somethin they can feel
if it aint bout the squad dont give a fuck
pistol in your hand dont make you real

outro
money in your palm dont make you real
pistol in your hand dont make you real
money in your palm dont make you real421embed"
