no warmth no hug no kind words are said
will you dream of me or someone new instead oh
just love me and mean it ill follow you blind
lately i feel like a heart left behind
i just cant stand still till you make up your mind
let me know let me know i have a right
before you touch me one more night
have i won your love or have i lost the fight
let me know let me know i have a right
to plan my future get on with my life
tell me face to face dont try to be polite
ill take it ill make it
ooh yes i will
ooh yeah yeah yeah

im livin each minute with all that ive got
each breath is important each heartbeat is hot
thats the way we were way back you forgot he forgot he forgot
ooh

to know that a good thing has turned for the bad
both of us are here but wheres the love we had
let me know let me know i have a right
before you touch me one more night
