what happens to a man when
he spills his heart on a page and
he watches words flow away then
his feelings lie on the page alone
there waiting
for someone who cares to read them
to open their eyes to see them
to see if they can make his thoughts their own

hook
to find out that maybe your lifes not perfect
maybe its not worth what he gives away

chorus
you can see that this broken soul is bleeding
so you concede your feelings inside yourself
and wander through my heart
letting you see through me
now only consumes me
forget your pain watch me fall apart

verse 2
what happens to a soul when
its trapped inside his emotions
and all of these words hes spoken
they bind him to the life hes left behind
and every new step he takes he
knows that he might not make it
to all of these dreams that he has yet to find
you might also likehook
maybe your lifes not perfect
but maybe its not worth what he gives away

chorus
you can see that this broken soul is bleeding
so you concede your feelings inside yourself
and wander through my heart
letting you see through me
now only consumes me
forget your pain and watch me fall apart
as i fall apart
you can see that this broken soul is bleeding
so you concede your feelings inside yourself
and wander through my heart
letting you see through me
now only consumes me
forget your pain and watch me fall apart
as i fall apartembed"
