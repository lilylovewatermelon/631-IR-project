verse 1
back the hell off
rock and roll jesus with all my nails on
all i need is a blunt and a bail bond
and give these blind motherfuckers somethin to feel on
rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on
and lets roll down the hill til the hill gone
i started on the block but thats somethin to build on
and how can i pray when i got nuttin to kneel on

chorus
hey the ground is gone
dont look now but the ground is gone
im so high that the ground is gone
and i dont even know which cloud im on
dont look down but the ground is gone
dont look down cause the ground is gone
right now im a million miles from home
and im so high that the ground is gone

verse 2
huh walk on air
show me to the edge and i walk off there
we aint high enough au contraire
and sometimes life just dont compare
sasay my name baby pull my hair
and ima fuck you like a bull i swear
i got a lot of love that i could just share
i got a lot of drugs that i could just share
iii know i know what you like girl
a nice little mirror and a little white girl
way at the top of the mountain bouncing
may i be everything but grounded
i dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom
i just wanna float float like muhammad
i dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom
i just wanna float

verse 3
hey i know a girl named crystal her last name ball
