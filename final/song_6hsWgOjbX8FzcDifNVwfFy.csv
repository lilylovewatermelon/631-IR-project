verse 1 nas
book one strategy tactics techniques
look dumb but masterfully notice the weakness
in all them gotta shoot only if necessary
homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
beware the thugs who aint scared of blood or jail time
when aryan nations aint having integration
we so blind the beauty of life
was when my mom said nigga you could be christ
i wasnt old enough to hold my dick and pee right
jesus what is he like
i picture him standing with diamonds on him
little different from the way my mommy saw him
practice your aiming physical training in difficult terrain and
test your endurance try to keep your stamina banging
splitting dutches up strap up the armies is school
teaching smart ways to kill im thinking gandhi was a fool
the chronics a fool got me thinking out loud fuck it
sleep on my drunkenness ill blow your brains out

verse 2 lake
my revolution is as real as bobby seales
i build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in dix hills
for fishscale to cop guns the time come
ill mask up and get my comrade off the bus
fuck the beef ill snatch your seed from chuckie cheese
and feed him to the rats in the back of the ps
black fatigues and ar15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen louie vuitton holsters
my motions dont appeal to appellate divisions
i did it strong for 7 long years in prison fuck the system
im like a modern day hitler
black gorilla crip and blood in one nigga
only killers know my face
i beat a case for shooting at the police nigga the name lake
though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new huey newton

verse 3 nas  lake
teach yall women how to hold the family down in case something happens to its fathers
protect the children grab revolvers
the women plays important part of our life force
so what we fight for my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
uh and listen more and talk less
watch all and trust none demand your respect
and be ready to die for what you believe in
and ride all the time not just when convenient
justice and freedom wisdom and understanding
we the lost children of israel in this western world region
you aint a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in
strong rule the weak but the wise rule the strong
its more to a war than just getting it on
conceal your form cover your tracks stay prepared
i dont care if no ones spared in

chorus nas
revolutionary warfare its all fair in love and war
for the cause i gotta take you off here
revolutionary warfare its all fair in love and war
for the cause i gotta take you off here
revolutionary warfare its all fair in love and war
for the cause i gotta take you off here
revolutionary warfare its all fair in love and war
for the cause i gotta take you off here3embed"
