verse 1
youre never ever wrong
always something more to say
youre never wrong
well you never mind ill be fine
youre never wrong
and theres nothing more to say
youre never wrong
its gonna end this time

youre never wrong
you can never be contained
youre never wrong
well you never mind ill be fine
youre never wrong
dont even bother to explain
youre never wrong
youll never win this time

feel the anger coming
feel my patience running
well its plain to see that
you have lost your damn mind

chorus
how could you let it end up this way
is there really nothing more you can say
im not taking
another fucking dose of your denial today
im not willing to deal with someone
who insists that they can never be wrong
so just keep on talking to the wall
because im walking away

verse 2
youre never ever wrong
and you never will believe
that you were wrong
youll just never mind and be fine
youre never wrong
are you really that deceived
the illusion has to end this time

well you were wrong
i know its difficult to see
that you were wrong
in your little mind every time
yeah you were wrong
and now youd better believe
the game is coming to an end this time
prechorus
feel the anger coming
feel my patience running
and its easy to see
youve made me lose my damn mind

chorus
how could you let it end up this way
is there really nothing more you can say
im not taking
another fucking dose of your denial today
im not willing to deal with someone
who insists that they can never be wrong
so just keep on talking to the wall
because im walking away

bridge
if you shut your mouth
then we just might make it
you want a fight be careful
what youre wishing for
so say it again push it again
and there is no coming back this time

shut your mouth
cause i just cant take it
im ready to fight
is it all that you were hoping for
dont say it againâ€”do it again
therell be no coming back this time
chorus
how could you let it end up this way
is there really nothing more you can say
im not taking
another fucking dose of your denial today
im not willing to deal with someone
who insists that they can never be wrong
so just keep on talking to the wall
because im walking away

how could you let it end up this way
is there really nothing more you can say
im not taking
another fucking dose of your denial today
im not willing to deal with someone
who insists that they can never be wrong
so just keep on talking to the wall
because im walking away
