can i get your hand to write on
just a piece of leg to bite on
what a night to fly my kite on
do you want to flash a light on

refrain
take a look its on display for you
comin down no not today

verse 2
did you meet your fortune teller
get it off with no propeller
do it up its on with stella
what a way to finally smell her

refrain
pickin up but not too strong for you
take a piece and pass it on

chorus
fly away on my zephyr
i feel it more than ever
and in this perfect weather
well find a place together
postchorus
fly on my wind

verse 3
rebel and a liberator
find a way to be a skater
rev it up to levitate her
super friendly aviator

refrain
take a look its on display for you
comin down no not today

chorus
fly away on my zephyr
i feel it more than ever
and in this perfect weather
well find a place together

postchorus
in the water where i center my emotion
all the world can pass me by
fly away on my zephyr
well find a place together
