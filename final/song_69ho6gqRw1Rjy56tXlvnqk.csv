and if i lost the map
if i lost it all
or fell into the trap
then shed call

chorus 1
when youre tired of racing and you
found you never left the start
come on baby don’t let it break your heart

verse 2
though heavily we bled
still on we crawl
trying to catch a cannonball
and a slow burning tide
through my veins is flowing
from my shipwreck i heard her call
and she sang

chorus 2
when youre tired of aiming your arrows
still you never hit the mark ohoh
and even in your rains and shadows
still were never gonna part ohoh
come on baby don’t let it break your heart

don’t let it break your heart
oh ohoh ohoh oh
don’t let it break your heart
