days swiftly come and go
im dreaming of her
shes seeing other guys
emotions astir
the sun is gone
the nights are long
and i am left while the tears fall

on the phone

being alone
ill find someone new

my heart is crushed by a former love
can you help me find a way to carry on again

verse 2
wish cast into the sky
im moving on
sweet beginnings do arise
she knows i was wrong
the notes are old
they bend they fold
and so do i to a new love
