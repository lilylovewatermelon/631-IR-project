dont let it get to you no baby
girl i know youre fed up but things gonna get a lot better
dont let it get to you no baby
dont wanna see you give up whatever you do dont let up

verse 1
girl i know that things are hard now
and youre feeling that youre all alone
mom  dads no long round now
cause now youre grown with kids of your own
baby dad is nowhere to be found
while you play the role of mom  papi
raising them all by yourself
always home and cant go out now
cant remember the last time that you were happy
whatever you do

chorus
dont let it get to you no baby
girl i know youre fed up but things gonna get a lot better
dont let it get to you no baby
dont wanna see you give up whatever you do dont let up

verse 2
every man that you meet on the streets
youre looking at him like hes an enemy
just give us one more chance
girl i know that you cant hurt no more
youve been damaged cant trust nobody
and i know that you can just move on
if you let your past go with the wind
and smile more often
then you will find that guy that you always wanted
from friend to husband
so girl just know that
