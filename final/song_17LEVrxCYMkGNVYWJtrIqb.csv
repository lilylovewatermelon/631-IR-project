ive been waiting all this time soliciting is my one crime
take a step which way to go with no permission from a ho
and a limp with no deseases my back seats got remedies
ill be part of history with 15 books on my story
and be a swift like roddigan equipt with the best selection
wondering what you use slipping off the booze cruise
and your focus turns to blur when you set your eyes on her
as i turn away when she looks at me

chorus
and im a wanting watching you walk away
i try to meet you by the old highway
and if its now im down to slack
with the sun shown accross my back
now that your gone moving right along

2nd chorus
why am i so short of your attention
having this discussiom downtown
no obligation its a real hard emotion
now that yrun down the road still viewing sluts bowcats
these hos are trying to fool me
no promises you get the one time slam
seductive sexy capers in the hilton tram
with this abuse of napkins
xamount of heineken
waking ups so hard to do when im lying next to you
so im knockin at your door complicates the night before
she said the joke is on me i said the joke is on her
mary oh mary your still so quite contrary
how could you ever knowour gone
and im a wanting watching you walk away
i try to meet you by the old highway
and if its now im down to slack
with the sun shown accross my backyou might also likeembed"
