you are very young you are clever and you are very beautiful because of your youth you should be exceptionally valuable to us
and i was very lonely so i thought tonight i will have an adventure
if im never to see you again i can forget you in a minute youll see

shes just pretending
you were wrong i wasnt i loved you

verse 1
well this thing that we had built
was flaying into shreds
it was sharp and it was dry
like the hair on a shrunken head

and all the kings men
spread the pieces on the floor
by the time they fit together
we had forgotten what they were for

pretending like shes beautiful
in the pictures i can see
but she only picks the good ones
and thats more than i can say for me

chorus
but thats the way it always starts
you feel like lily and the jack of hearts
always making out like bandits
until you get away and it falls apart
it falls apart

youre always dressed up like a priest
youre always drilling through the wall
cracking the safe and skipping town
while poor rosemary takes the fall

youre always looking for the future
rinsing out the dye
looking for a moral to the story
that sounded good and happened to rhyme

rosemary on the gallows
dressed like nothings wrong
no funeral no flowers
for an outlaw in a song

chorus
but thats the way it always starts
you feel like lily and the jack of hearts
always making out like bandits
until you get away and it falls apart
it falls apart

shes just pretending
you were wrong i wasnt i loved you
chorus

outro
but thats the way it always starts thats the way it always starts
you feel like lily and the jack of hearts2embed"
