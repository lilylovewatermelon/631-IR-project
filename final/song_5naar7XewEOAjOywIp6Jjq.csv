thought i saw your shadow under the door
just a trick of the light ive seen before
i can never tell whats real anymore
anymore anymore

verse 2
i remember when we ran from the pool
all the decorations up in your room
and i couldnt find the right words to use
but i knew that you knew

prechorus
its seemed so long its seemed so long
the moments that stay they turn out all wrong
when i look around youre gone

chorus 1
oh oh ohoh ohoh
oh oh ohoh ohoh

bridge
all the places i return to
all the faces that remind you

chorus 2
i can still see you at the place i know when i close my eyes
do you remember when we felt like the only two alive
dont let me be one of the people that seek a lost romance
would you go and do it all over again given the chance

oh oh ohoh ohoh
oh oh ohoh ohoh
