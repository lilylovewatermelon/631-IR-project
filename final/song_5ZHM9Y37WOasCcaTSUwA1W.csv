leave your mark under my skin
oh my how strong you are
then feast your eyes on my disdain
and hope this one wont scar

prechorus
i will never belong to you again
i will never belong to you

verse 2
push if you still need my pain
cause i will never tell
and scream if you still hate my name
cause ill be where i fell

bridge
come sit close to me
let me feel your breath
come sit close to me
hands around my neck
come sit close to me
let me feel your breath
come sit close to me
close to me

i will never belong to you again
i will never belong to you

chorus
if i decide that i am alive
then im diseased and ungrateful
if i confide that i am a liar
then im diseased and ungrateful
so push it in
till it breaks
if i bleed ill be okay
if i decide that i am alive
then im diseased and ungrateful
if i confide that i am a liar
then im diseased and ungrateful
if i decide that i am alive
then im diseased and ungrateful
if i confide that i am a liar
then im diseased and ungrateful

outro
come sit close to me
come sit close to me
come sit close to me
come sit close to me3embed"
