i got a problem with the snakes that are crawling
through my area
when the darkness has fallen
and mama told me that they love to bite
they stab you in the back
no shame thats right
what what
i keep my distance because they are making me crazy
and stealing from me
you know those fuckers are lazy
my blood boils
fat turns to oil
step the fuck back or you will get buried in soil
over drama
or you could sleep with the fishes
my clutches are tight
and ill take your last wishes
one for your money
two for your girl
three for your life
now i fucked up your world

chorus
do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels
to be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
i dont like how it feels check it
do you know how it feels
to be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
break it down
you might also likeverse 2
yo its kind of funny how you are running your mouth man
you are caught in a lie
and now theres no way out come on
betray your friends and your peeps and your family
living like a snake
living like a bloody thief
check my speech cause its deep like the sea
from me to you all
and then from you all back to me ha
danger danger
slay snakes like a ranger
military style fears god
not a stranger
now tell me tell me whose crew sicker
mines sicker
get on your knees to be a dick licker
one for your money
two for your girl
three for your life
now i fucked up your world

chorus
check it
do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels
to be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
i dont like how it feels check it
do you know how it feels
to be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
bridge
do you like how it feels
i dont like how it feels
i dont like it
i dont want it
i dont need it
i dont like it
i dont want it
i dont need it
what the fuck is up

chorus
do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels
to be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
do you like how it feels
i dont like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills

outro
by the snake that kills
by the snake that killsembed"
