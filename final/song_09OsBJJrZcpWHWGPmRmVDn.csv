i cant believe this moments come
its so incredible that were alone
theres so much to be said and done
its impossible not to be overcome
will you forgive me if i feel this way
cuz weve just met tell me thats ok
so take this feeling n make it grow
never let it never let it go

chorus bryan adams  sarah mclachlan both
dont let go of the things you believe in
you give me something that i can believe in
dont let go of this moment in time
go of this moment in time
dont let go of things that youre feeling
i cant explain the things that im feeling
dont let go
no i wont let go

verse 2
now would you mind if i bared my soul
if i came right out and said youre beautiful
cuz theres something here i cant explain
i feel im diving into driving rain
you get my senses running wild
i can t resist your sweet sweet smile
so take this feeling n make it grow
never let it  never let it go

so cmon just hold on tightembed"
