where are you going with your long face
pulling down dont hide away
like an ocean that you cant see but you can smell
and the sound of the waves crash down

hook
i am no superman i have no reasons for you
i am no hero oh thats for sure
but i do know one thing
is where you are is where i belong
i do know where you go is where i want to be

where are you going
where do you go

verse 2
are you looking for answers
to questions under the stars
well if along the way
you are grown weary
you can rest with me until
a brighter day and youre okay

hook
i am no superman i have no answers for you
i am no hero oh thats for sure
but i do know one thing
is where you are is where i belong
i do know where you go is where i want to be
