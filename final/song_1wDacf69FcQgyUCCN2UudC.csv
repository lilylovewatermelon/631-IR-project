ladies and gentlemen good afternoon from the flight deck
were cruising at 37000 feet and we just passed over the coast
well be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes
id like to take this opportunity to welcome you to america

verse 1
i was made in america
land of the free home of the brave
and right up under your nose you might see a sex slave being traded
and who will do anything for the money
boy a mama might sell her babies
sell porn sell pills anything to pay the bills
anything to bring that paper
gotta scratch that itch gotta scratch them ticks
ain’t rich but i might be
and imma shoot these flicks imma turn these tricks
anything for a slight fee
yeah made in america
momma told me that i belong here
had to earn our stripes had to learn our rights
had to fight for a home here
but i wouldnt know a thing about that
all i know is drugs and rap
i probably coulda been some kinda doctor
instead of holdin guns and crack
i was born in the mainland
greatgrandpa from a strange land
he was stripped away and given bricks to lay
i guess you could say he a slave hand
but i was made in america
so i don’t know a thing about that
all i know is uncle sam lookin for me workin on his corner
so i know i gotta pay tax
gettin paid in america
i was raised in america
and this is all i ever known
if i’m wrong then you better come save me america

verse 2
man i’d die for america
i served my time for america
got shotshot back went to war
got back and ain’t nobody give a jack in america
i coulda lost my life
boy i lost my wife
i can’t even get right in my homeland
cold sweats hold tecs paranoia
lookin out for a threat in my own land
i was trained in america
how they get up in them planes in america
flew em right into the buildings
takin out civilians
people gettin killed in america
and i’m still in america
though america ain’t feelin me
i went to war for this country
turn around came home and you drillin me
when y’all free here sayin  you don’t wanna be here
boy you probably couldnt breathe here
if i didn’t load a couple magazines here
y’all just complain in america
i’m jumpin outta military planes from america
aye i was made in america
thats why i’m out here savin america
i got a brother in the cemetery now
cause he wanted y’all safe safe
and everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear about face bout face
we bled for america
to keep y’all fed in america
but whats the point of talkin
a lot of y’all don’t really even care america

verse 3
i wish i lived in america
wanna raise my kids in america
heard everybody rich
all i gotta do is run jump kick
im a hit in ya area
so please pick me america
i know youll probably never love me
ya never hear about me on the news
and ya probably never been to my country
i hear ya sellin education and got clothes that ya throw away
got plenty food in ya  nation
i could tell cause a lot of y’all are overweight
i already work for y’all
i’m in the sweatshops makin these shirts for y’all
naw i ain’t gettin money
go to bed hungry but i make some exports for y’all
but y’all don’t know a thing about that
you was made in america
i’m tryna to find me a ticket where the sky is the limit
catch a plane to america
it should be plain to america
y’all blessed and ya got it made
heard y’all don’t pray no more y’all ain’t saved no more
y’all looking for another way
well i hope it ain’t true but i’m packin my suit
farewell to my motherland
said bye to my loved ones
fate here i come i’m goin to another land
i done made it to america
i’m amazed at america
but i couldn’t get approval to stay so they sent me away from america39embed"
