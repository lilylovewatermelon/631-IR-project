far from home on a road unknown
where the vultures circle on winds that blow
from northern skies that haunt these waking moments
on shadows cast by the mountain range
on calloused soles we find our way
through desperate eyes we long for the horizon
while this sun is rising

chorus
we are the long forgotten sons
and daughters that dont belong to anyone
and we are alone under this sun
and we want to fix the work that youve undone

verse 2
when cries for help go unanswered
and signal fires just burn and burn
we wonder if were waiting here for nothing
cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
with the constant drone of the unfulfilled
but well never fall if we stand for something
we stand for something

chorus
we are the long forgotten sons
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and daughters that dont belong to anyone
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and we are alone under this sun
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and we want to fix the work that youve undone
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go

dont fall i see lights in the distance
theyre not far away
stand up cause the sky is turning gray
theres hope in these footsteps of persistence
so dont go astray
these lights get closer everyday
we are the long forgotten sons
yeah we are the long forgotten sons

chorus
we are the long forgotten sons
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and daughters that dont belong to anyone
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and we are alone under this sun
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
and we want to fix the work that youve undone
what happens now we dont know just hold on tight now here we go
