werent you the one that said that you dont want me anymore
and how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
and how i cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
but still you said that love was gone and that i had to leave

prechorus
now you talkin bout a family
now you saying i complete your dream oh
now you saying im your everything
youre confusing me
what you say to me
dont play with me
dont play with me

chorus
cause what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
now whos crying desiring to come back to me
what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
now whos crying desiring to come back

postchorus
i remember when
i was sittin home alone
waitin for you
til three oclock in the morn

and when you came home youd always have some sorry excuse
half explaining to me like im just some kind of a fool
i sacrificed the things i want just to do things for you
but when its time to do for me you never come through

prechorus
now you wanna be a part of me ayy
now you have so much to say to me hey
now you wanna make time for me
what you doin to me
youre confusing me
dont play with me
dont play with me

chorus
cause what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
now whos crying desiring to come back to me
what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
now whos crying desiring to come back

waiting for you
til three oclock in the morn
bridge
night after night
knowing something going on

lord knows it wasnt easy believe me
never thought youd be the one that would deceive me
and never do what you was supposed to do
no need to approach me boo cause im over you

chorus
cause what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
