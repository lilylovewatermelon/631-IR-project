when you live
by daylight
with angels
at your side
in order now
bestowed by
the light of
the sunrise

prechorus
and you remember everything
only til the sun recedes once again

chorus
and the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven

verse 2
the whites of your eyes
turn black in the lowlight
in turning divine
we tangle endlessly
like lovers entwined
i know for the last time
you will not be mine
so give me the night the night the night
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven
the night comes down like heaven the whites of your eyes
the night comes down like heaven turn black in the lowlight
the night comes down like heaven in turning divine
the night comes down like heaven we tangle endlessly1embed"
