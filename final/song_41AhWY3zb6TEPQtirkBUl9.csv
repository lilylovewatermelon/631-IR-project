my heavens low but the songs the same
seems im always looking when i hear your name
youve been away but dont leave this side
seen all of your faces youve tried to hide
so im sitting here in a train station
lord knows ill step with no hesitation
ohoh ive seen through your lies
still im one still im one to testify and i say

chorus
ill find a way to let you know
hold me close when trade winds blow
chances are youre over me ill catch that train eventually
to the questions that youre asking
ive only expected everything ohoh
these arms of mine are burning
as i see as i see those pages turning and i say
ill find a way to let you know
hold me close when trade winds blow
chances are youre over me ill catch that train eventually
ill find a way to let you know
hold me close when trade winds blow
chances are youre over me ill catch that train eventually
