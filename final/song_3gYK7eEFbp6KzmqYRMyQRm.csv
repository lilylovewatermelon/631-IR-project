i was in pittsburgh when i saw superman in the backroom
he was doing lines or something in the bathroom
i barely recognized him at all
i saw him doing things you shouldnt do with all that power
i wish someone would have thrown him in the shower
i barely recognized him at all

chorus
that night i put my youth in a casket
and buried it inside of me
that night i saw through all the magic
now im a witness to the death of a hero
i burned all the pictures in the attic
and threw away the magazines
that night i saw through all the magic
and now im a witness to the death of a hero

verse 2
i tried to look away but you cant look away from a trainwreck
the things you said to girls well they were shameless
i barely recognized him at all
i tried to help but he said he was just too far from saving
and nothing i could say was gonna change him
i barely recognized him at all
