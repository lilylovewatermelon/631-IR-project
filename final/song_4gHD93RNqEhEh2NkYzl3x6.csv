how can we make amends
when we said all we said
i call and you dont pick up
how can i say instead
that i hope its for the best
i wont and i wont give up
im sorry mother
i know i let you down
im sorry for how
i up and left this town
how can we push aside
all the bad and make it right
now you got me all choked up

chorus 1
im sorry brother
i know i let you down
im sorry for how
i up and left this town
but please just listen
cause i dont ask for much
i am my own man
i make my own luck

verse 2
how can we both take sides
when we know nothings right
open up the door thats shut
how can i have my pride
and drink away my soul tonight
sorrows filling up my cup
