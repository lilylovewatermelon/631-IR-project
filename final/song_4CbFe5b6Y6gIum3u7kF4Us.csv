this is where ive got to draw the line
cause i refuse to let you think you can play with my mind
always seems that you think that im blind
cause theres always certain times when youre hard to find
youre on the go im on the go were on the go
i cant catch you no more cant see you no more
and it no longer can be ignored
cause that once upon a time it was you i adored
you disappeared and left me here out in the cold
and the absence of you is hurtin my soul
i didnt know that was an end of the road
it was so easy for you just to let it all go

chorus
and i refuse i refuse to have one more sleepless night
i refuse i refuse to let a tear fall out my eye
i refuse i refuse to continue to try
i felt like i would die or i could break down and cry
and i refuse i refuse to let you walk back through that door
i refuse i refuse to let you hurt me anymore
and i refuse i refuse to continue to ignore
the fact i fell to the floor the day you walked out my door

postchorus
and i refuse
no way i can take it baby
i refuse
no way i can take it baby
and i refuse
no way but i refuse to take it anymore

remember when i told you i could feel the change change
you dont touch me the same the same
nor hold me the same the same
no i dont want you to take all the blame
cause i know i had those moments when i caused the pain
this back and forth just like a war with you and me with you and me
see we both disagree have we ever agreed
this aint nothin like i thought it would be
was it all just a dream was it ever in my reach

chorus
and i refuse i refuse to have one more sleepless night
i refuse i refuse to let a tear fall out my eye
and i refuse i refuse to continue to try
i felt like i would die or i could break down and cry
and i refuse i refuse to let you walk back through that door
i refuse i refuse to let you hurt me anymore
and i refuse i refuse to continue to ignore
the fact i fell to the floor the day you walked out my door

bridge

chorus

and i refuse i refuse to continue to ignore
