when i met you love i hadnt done the dirty yet seriously
called me a unicorn said that i didnt exist
truth is my card was torn the v had a couple of rips
but i was still holding on to the edge with my finger tips

prechorus
with a little bit of prayer a little bit of porn sorry
couple long nights sleeping on my own
waiting for the right one to come along
waiting for the right one and now i know that

chorus
i was holding out for you
yeah i was holding out for you
and the neighbors yeah they all hate us
cause they say that we go too loud
ive been holding out for you oh yeah

verse 2
and a couple times thought i might not make it
laying on the bed both of us half naked
looking in her eyes something in my heart said save it
here we go again another awkward conversation

prechorus
with a little bit of prayer a little bit of porn sorry
couple long nights sleeping on my own
waiting for the right one to come along
waiting for the right one and now i know that
