three its a magic number
yes it is its a magic number

verse 1
because two times three is six
and three times six is eighteen
and the eighteenth letter in the alphabet is r
weve got three rs were going to talk about today

chorus 2
weve got to learn to
reduce reuse recycle

verse 2
if youre going to the market to buy some juice
youve got to bring your own bags and you learn to reduce your waste
and if your brother or your sisters got some cool clothes
you could try them on before you buy some more of those
reuse weve got to learn to reuse
and if the first two rs dont work out
and if youve got to make some trash
dont throw it out
recycle weve got to learn to recycle
