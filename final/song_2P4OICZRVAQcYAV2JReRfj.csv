where theres a will theres a way kinda beautiful
and every night has its day so magical
and if theres love in this life theres no obstacle
that cant be defeated
for every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
in every lost soul the bones of a miracle
for every dreamer a dream were unstoppable
with something to believe in

chorus
monday left me broken
tuesday i was through with hopin
wednesday my empty arms were open
thursday waiting for love waiting for love
thank the stars its friday
im burning like a fire gone wild on saturday
guess i wont be coming to church on sunday
ill be waiting for love
waiting for love to come around

instrumental break

verse 2
we are one of a kind irreplaceable
how did i get so blind and so cynical
if theres love in this life were unstoppable
no we cant be defeated
