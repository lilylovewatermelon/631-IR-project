where the north wind meets the sea
theres a river full of memory
sleep my darling safe and sound
for in this river all is found
all is found
when all is lost then all is found

verse 2
in her waters deep and true
lie the answers and a path for you
dive down deep into her sound
but not too far or youll be drowned

verse 3
she will sing to those wholl hear
and in her song all magic flows
but can you brave what you most fear
can you face what the river knows

verse 4
until the rivers finally crossed
youll never feel the solid ground
you had to get a little lost
on your way to being found
you might also likeverse 5
where the north wind meets the sea
theres a mother full of memory
come my darling homeward bound
where all is lost then all is found

outro
all is found
all is found1embed"
