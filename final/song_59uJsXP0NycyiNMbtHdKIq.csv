i just need this to be alright
i cant feel this another night
i cant take this i come unglued
i might breakdown in front of you
necessary to medicate
im not sleeping cant stay awake

chorus
cant see through this
too much pressure
drowning in this
too much pressure

verse 2
if you need me ill be here
half unconscious escape my fear
i cant take this i come unglued
i might breakdown in front of you
necessary to medicate
im not sleeping cant stay awake

chorus
cant see through this
too much pressure
drowning in this
too much pressure
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
my head hurts this shit isnt getting me high
my chest is so tight am i going to die
my stomachs in knots and the room starts to spin
as i wait for this valium to slowly kick in

chorus
cant see through this
too much pressure
drowning in this
too much pressure

chorus
cant see through this
too much pressure
drowning in this
too much pressureembed"
