light that comes up
on the ceiling
my mouth
and these arms
hold the feeling
even i cant control my nature

bridge
if they should come up much before you
i would not ever try to capture you

chorus
bluebird where you gonna go now

verse 2
lead me to the gallows
where out corner my eye
theres something
its pulling me back from nothing
from nothing

bridge
if they should come up much before you
i would not ever try to capture you

bluebird where you gonna go now

outro

before they are over
