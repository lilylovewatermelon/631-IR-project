whisper to me softly
breathe words upon my skin
no ones near and listening
so please dont say goodbye

just hold me close and love me
press your lips to mine
mmm feels so right feels so right

lying here beside you
i hear the echoes of your sighs
promise me youll stay with me
and keep me warm tonight

just hold me close and love me
give my heart a smile
mmm feels so right feels so right

your body feels so gentle
and my passion rises high
