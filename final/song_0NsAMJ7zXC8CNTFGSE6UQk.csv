and time waits for no man but you
and time waits for no man but you
hold on and dont leave this town
hold on and dont leave this town

verse 1
here we are with art in our hands
they tear you down cause they dont understand
you tried it once again to love me better
she tore those panties down and loved me wetter

chorus
oh woahohoh
and life comes in twos and threes and fours
oh woahohoh
and i hear you knocking at my door

verse 2
to hold them down with blood on your hands
is past the point where you dont understand
the worst you do is lie when you run for shelter
so cast aside these chains and love me better

chorus
oh woahohoh
and life comes in twos and threes and fours
oh woahohoh
and i hear you knocking at my door
oh woahohoh
and life comes in twos and threes and fours
oh woahohoh
and i hear you knocking at my door
see the kooks liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeinstrumental break

outro
i hear you knocking at my door darling twenty times or more
i hear you knocking at my door darling twenty times or more
i hear you knocking at my door darling twenty times or more
i hear you knocking at my door darling twenty times or moreembed"
