looking back at the beginning of this
and how life was
just you and me lovin all of our friends
living life like an ocean
but now the currents only pulling me down
its getting harder to breathe
it wont be too long and ill be going under
can you save me from this

chorus
cause its not my time im not going
theres a fear in me its not showing
this could be the end of me
and everything i know
ooh but i wont go

verse 2
i look ahead to all the plans that we made
and the dreams that we had
im in a world that tries to take em away
oh but im taking them back
cause all this time ive just been too blind to understand
what should matter to me
my friend this life we live its not what we have
its what we believe in

its not my time im not going
theres a fear in me its not showing
this could be the end of me
and everything i know
but its not my time im not going
theres a will in me and now i know that
this could be the end of me
and everything i know
ooh but i wont go whoa whoa ohoh

there might be more than you believe

theres a fear in me its not showing
this could be the end of me
and everything i know

and everything i know
