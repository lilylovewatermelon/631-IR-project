whispered leaves on swaying trees
and mysteries define
summer nights of endless light
remind us of the line thats yours and mine

verse 2
thoughts of green and breezes mean
im growing from a stem
missing dirt on my tshirt
youll move a little closer but the moving isnt over if its

chorus
them and you and me stringing electricity
and the rest of it is waiting under
when it overflows taking us where no one knows
we remember when we fell into the trap

verse 3
midnight air is unprepared for
thoughts we would condemn
silence of the stars above in any other weather
we would try to stay together but its

chorus
them and you and me stringing electricity
and the rest of it is waiting under
when it overflows taking us where no one knows
we remember when we fell into the trap
you might also likebridge
mothers and fathers without will doubt
brother to brother another hold out
imagine a world if the numbers would take some time out
me without you and you without
i want to break out of this abstracting pattern of layers but its on5embed"
