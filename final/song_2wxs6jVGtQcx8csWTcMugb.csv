ludacris
well you can bring the drinks a little mo my way
more i say on another hot sunny californye day
just touched down called up my 818
fo a date with some other bust downs
and i cruised up the block car losed up the top
i take the breeze quick break the trees
feel good as we flippin through the robb repot
my baby momma aint trippin on child suppot

dj quik
because she cant support that garbage she should come pay homage
when we pair em we gon share em when im finished we all switch
i aint really got the time yo im chillin with luda
cris stop and twist the buddha got me feelin like this is it
if we gon party we gon sip we got a bar
we all in shape we gon go far you cant stop the car
we on the freeway if you get out you burnt

dj quik
arabian spruce seagrams bumpy and juice
we used to bag and then truce we used to sag and get loose
not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
but to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
we get the news like mtv every ten to the hour
we play mario brothers we eat the shroom and get power
now eat your sour powers and use your dental floss
what does bein mental cost if you aint knowin you already lost

ludacris
so stay with me and lets get tipsy
rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
runnin round grinnin runnin round sinnin
gettin lit then i wonder why my head kept spinnin
but im all grown up now less throwin up now
record blowed up so my hood throwed up
now lets break loose cause your boys arrived
and tonight we gon celebrate bein alive riiiiight

ludacris
its just one of those days without a care in the world
you aint gotta look mean i know you care for your girl
but shes lookin this way and im gonna come get her
fresh haircut so im feelin quite chipper
cant nothin go wrong cause my straps on my back
and if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
but forget the clickclack aint no need for the steel
just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

dj quik
if its los angeles watch a boss handle biz
imma put this on my kids stupid its an outfit
if you aint been around the world keep yo mouth zipped
cause i do windage and elevation
you see im not normal and im not a homo
im mo apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
and call it more hoes volume 5 volume 6
and show it in the back of my truck at the picnic

hook  repeat 2x2embed"
