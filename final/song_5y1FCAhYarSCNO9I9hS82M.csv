you dont have to be so loud
everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
you dont have to try so hard
i think they got the message you were out of your mind
its not so good to see you this upset
but the next generation will forget

prechorus
theyre always scared of where their daughters been
cause who knows she could be alone with men
they never wanna see or hear or think about again

chorus
is it gone
i hope that nothins wrong
is it gone
i hope that nothins wrong

verse 2
oh please dont try to lick my face
everyone can see that youre a psycho in this place
the next generation will forget

bridge
where their daughters been
or who knows you could be alone with men
theyre never gonna let you understand
or show you what is to be a man
you dont wanna sit down and think or hear
you dont think anyone is in your ear
i never wanna see your face
accuse  its no ones fault
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus

i hope that nothins wrong

i hope that nothins wrong

prechorus
theyre always scared of where their daughters been
cause who knows she could be alone with men
they never wanna see or hear or think about again

chorus
