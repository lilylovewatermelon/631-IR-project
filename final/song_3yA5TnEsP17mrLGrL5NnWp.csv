how can i explain
talking to myself
will i see again

we are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
on and on and on we are calling out and out again
never looking down im just in awe of whats in front of me

is it real now
when two people become one
i can feel it
when two people become one

thought id never see
the love you found in me
now its changing all the time
living in a rhythm where the minutes working overtime

we are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
on and on and on we are calling out and out again
never looking down im just in awe of whats in front of me

is it real now
when two people become one
i can feel it
when two people become one
you might also likeis it real now
when two people become one
i can feel it
when two people become one

catch me im falling down
catch me im falling down

dont stop just keep going on
im your shoulder lean upon
so come on deliver from inside
all we got is tonight that is right till first light

is it real now
when two people become one
i can feel it
when two people become one

is it real now
when two people become one
i can feel it
when two people become oneembed"
