whats wrong with the world mama
people livin like they aint got no mamas
i think the whole worlds addicted to the drama
only attracted to things thatll bring you trauma
overseas yeah we tryna stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here livin
in the usa the big cia
the bloods and the crips and the kkk
but if you only have love for your own race
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate then youre bound to get irate yeah
madness is what you demonstrate
and thats exactly how anger works and operates
man you gotta have love just to set it straight
take control of your mind and meditate
let your soul gravitate to the love yall yall

chorus justin timberlake
people killin people dyin
children hurtin hear them cryin
can you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
cause people got me got me questioning
where is the love

love where is the love the love
where is the love the love

verse 2 taboo
it just aint the same old ways have changed
new days are strange is the world insane
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that dont belong
nations droppin bombs
chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
with ongoing sufferin as the youth die young
so ask yourself is the lovin really gone
so i can ask myself really what is going wrong
with this world that we livin in people keep on givin in
makin wrong decisions only visions of them dividends
not respectin each other deny thy brother
a war is goin on but the reasons undercover
the truth is kept secret and swept under the rug
if you never know truth then you never know love
wheres the love yall come on i dont know
and wheres the truth yall come on i dont know
and wheres the love yall

chorus justin timberlake
people killin people dyin
children hurtin hear them cryin
can you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
cause people got me got me questioning
where is the love
postchorus william  fergie
love where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love
love where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love the love

verse 3 apldeap
i feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as im gettin older yall people gets colder
most of us only care about moneymakin
selfishness got us followin the wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
yo whatever happened to the values of humanity yeah
whatever happened to the fairness and equality yeah
instead of spreading love we spreading animosity yeah
lack of understanding leading us away from unity
thats the reason why sometimes im feelin under
thats the reason why sometimes im feelin down
its no wonder why sometimes im feelin under
gotta keep my faith alive til love is found
now ask yourself
postchorus william
where is the love
where is the love
where is the love
where is the love

chorus justin timberlake
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
cause people got me got me questioning
where is the love
