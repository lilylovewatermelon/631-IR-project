sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
sometimes i forget im alive
i feel it coming and ive got to get out of its way
i hear it calling and i come cause i cant disobey
i should not listen and i shouldnt believe but i do
yes i do

chorus
she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize
for the way i feel

verse 2
my life it seems has taken a turn
why in the name of god would i ever want to return
peel off our skin were gonna burn what we were to the ground
fuck in the fire and well spread all the ashes around
i want to kill away the rest of whats left and i do
yes i do

chorus
she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize
for the way i feel
see nine inch nails liveget tickets as low as 118you might also likebridge
and nothing can stop me now
there is nothing to fear
and everything id ever want
is inside of here

oh inside of here

outro
now i just stare into the sun
and i see everything ive done
i think i could have been someone
but i cant stop what has begun
when everything is said and done
and there is no place left to run
i think i used to be someone
now i just stare into the sun8embed"
