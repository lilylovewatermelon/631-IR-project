god knows i tried everything i could to stay inside tonight
but that boys like a sore in your mouth that you just have to bite
him number one is shakin hands with numbers two and three
is it guilty in here or is it just me

verse 2
ive made a point of not mixing love and pleasure in my life
cause daytime boys and nighttime boys
usually dont see eye to eye
but ive been on a roll of late and theyre all down on their knees
is it guilty in here or is just me

bridge
what became of all the boys who only want one thing
someone tell me what im doing wrong

chorus 1
cause the good ones all got wedding rings
and the young ones are just too dumb
and i dont think i have any more room underneath my thumb
maybe after all the ends do justify the means
is it guilty in here or is it just me
