more and more
i cant say no
so afraid of letting go
if theres something
i can grab
you can bet
ill pay the tab

chorus 1
counting all the flowers
waste the precious hours
i need to find some peace

verse 2
all these problems on my mind
make it hard for me to think
there is no way i can stop
my poor brain is gonna pop

chorus 2
and i dont have a purpose
scattered on the surface
i need to find some peace

and all the broken tethers
we can bring together
i need to find some peace
