somes born to take life safe and easy
i was born to live life on a dare
i never worried about the fall
you all just how high i got in the air
flipping dirt bikes and rolling daddys truck
the highs kept me smiling through the tears

chorus
ill take years off my life
before i take life off my years

verse 2
there are those who take it slow and steady
i happen to keep it between the lines
line up their ducks before theyre ready
ill have no regrets when it comes my time
lifes never dealt me any aces
but im all in doubledown no fear

chorus
ill take years off my life
before i take life off my years

verse 3
town water towers and county quarries
no trespassing meant come on in
skydiving drunk now theres your story
and giving that farmers bull a spin
aint a fan of going slow around corners
stomp on the gas and grab another gear
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
ill take years off my life
before i take life off my years

verse 4
i love the view up on this high wire
oh without a net down below
while most are running from the wildfires
i cant wait to get too close
whats the use of life if you dont live it
you sip your water ill drink my beer

chorus
ill take years off my life
before i take life off my years
ill take a couple years off my life
before i take life off my yearsembed"
