how long before i get in
before it starts before i begin
how long before you decide
before i know what it feels like
where to where do i go
if you never try then youll never know
how long do i have to climb
up on the side of this mountain of mine

verse 2
look up i look up at night
planets are moving at the speed of light
climb up up in the trees
every chance that you get
is a chance you seize
how long am i gonna stand
with my head stuck under the sand
ill start before i can stop
before i see things the right way up

chorus
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found got found
and birds go flyin at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flyin from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand

ideas that youll never find
all the inventors could never design
the buildings that you put up
japan and china all lit up
the sign that i couldnt read
or a light that i couldnt see
some things you have to believe
but others are puzzles puzzling me

chorus
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flyin at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flyin from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand
oh when you see it
then youll understand

bridge
all those signs i knew what they meant
some things you can invent
some get made and some get sent
ooh
outro
birds go flyin at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flyin from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand
oh when you see it
then youll understand26embed"
