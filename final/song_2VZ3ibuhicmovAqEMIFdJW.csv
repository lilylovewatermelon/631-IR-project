candy talks to strangers
thinks her lifes in danger
no one gives a damn about her hair
its lonely down on track street
she used to go by jackie
the cops theyll steal your dreams and theyll kill your prayers
take a number where the blood just barely dried

chorus
wait for something better
no one behind you
watching your shadows
this feeling wont go

verse 2
crooked wheels keep turning
children are you learning
acclimatized but dont you lose the plot
a history of blisters
your brothers and your sisters
somewhere in the pages we forgot

prechorus
take a number jackie
where the blood just barely dried
you know im on your side
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
wait for something better
no one behind you
watching your shadows
you got to be stronger than the story
dont let it blind you
rivers are shallow
this feeling wont go

bridge
your sky is full of dreams
but you dont know how to fly
i dont have a simple answer
but i know that i could answer
something better

outro
this feeling wont go
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it1embed"
