verse 1
my heart ticks in beat with these kids that i grew up with
living like lifes going out of style and you came to watch us play
like a big shot talent but at the end of the day you know
whoa where we come from and where we call home whoa

chorus
hey chris you were our only friend
and i know this is belated but we love you back

verse 2
theyll say its not worth it so well leave this town in ruin
living like lifes going out of style and you came to watch us play
like a big shot talent but at the end of the day you know
woah those busted lips we take back home

and i know this is belated but we love you back
