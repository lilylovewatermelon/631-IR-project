verse 1 eminem
flying down i75 bout to hop on 696
i look over this fuckin chicks tryna fix
her makeup im like bitch you aint a plastic surgeon
i advise ya to put up your visor im gettin kinda ticked
youre blockin my side mirror shes like yeah so
im like so you gon need a stitch you keep acting like that ho
i look like your husband slut thats a rhetorical question
you talk to me like you talk to him ill fuck you up
in fact get in the backseat like the rest of my dates
no bitch rides shotgun what taxi
stop and pick you some maxi pads up
is that what you actually ask me smack
bitch reaches over and smacks me
says i annoy the fuck out her get the fuckin bag
put on your slut powder you slut what
and shut the fuck up now or get your feelings hurt
worse than my last chick when i accidentally butt dialed her
and she heard me spreadin aids rumors about her
turn the radio up louder make it thump
while i bump that relapse cd
tryna hit every bump in that cunt
thought i snapped back into accents
cause she kept asking me to quit calling her cunt
i said i cant she said

verse 3 eminem
we been riding around in this hatchback til im fuckin hunchback
where the fucks this party at slutbag cunt cut what act

im tryna hear some bagpipes from baghdad
dont act like you dont like em them accents i rap tight
and imma torture you til we find this place oh yeah thats right
its music to my ears
thought it was just past this light and just past van dyke
better hit that map light read them directions oh yeah
you cant read and you cant write you told me that last night
she took my cd out the deck snapped it in half like snap
relapse sucked i snapped hit the gas like
blew through the light spun out hit a patch of black ice
forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back we jackknifed ah
bitch flew out the car i laughed like she deserved it
she didnt think id act like that in person
royce marshall just crashed right in front of the club
verse 4 royce da 5’9”  eminem
tell him ill be there in a minute glass breaks
im tryna break up this catfight
between my mistress and damn wife
then a chick wanted a hug she was fat so i gave her dap
then i tell her to scat im not mean im cute smooch
on my way to the front door takin the scenic route
to avoid this chick with a lace front
lookin like venuss and serenas hooves
im just sayin them chicks got horse asses they been attractive
hope when they see me
they dont slap me with they tennis racquets
my mind drifted back to this shit i see my wife push her down ah
step over her body then smack the mistress smack ah
police outside i turn and pass the gat to vishis
then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin ugh
he mugs the mistress turns around
and gives the missus hugs and kisses smooches
looks at me twisted like nickel yeah watch this shit
he smacks the dentures out of the mouth
of the fat bitch he rolled with and looks back to mention
royce its good to be back to business haha
