i spent all my time keeping you from doing wrong
you were my only nemesis
id foil your plans but still i miss
the moments when we didnt get along

i fell for you the moment that you pushed me
you captured me and held me for so long
but now youre doing battle with a panda from seattle
i miss the moments when we didnt get along

so search your heart please doctor d
and i am sure that you will see
that you were always meant to be
my only lifelong enemy

you gave my life heroic cause
back when my only mission was
the moments when we didnt get along
