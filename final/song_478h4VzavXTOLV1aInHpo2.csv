can you be my doctor can you fix me up
can you wipe me down
so i can make you give it up give it up
make you say my name like a jersey jersey
shuttin down the game
be my head coach so you can
and never take me down til you can taste the win
do it again and again till you say my name
and by the way im so glad

so i can give it to you rough like a first draft
hold you like a paper plane you know i got paper babe
