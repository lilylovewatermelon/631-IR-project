ladies and gentlemen
in this corner weighing in at 131 pounds
im sorry correction 126 pounds
its the girl that broke my heart
isnt she lovely folks
just look at that smile
draws me in every time

verse 1
someone call a medic cause i think shes gonna strike again
she slammed down the phone and gave the finger to the nightstand
that holds the picture in the heartshaped frame we bought at target
yes i think we got a problem but i cant put my finger on it

prechorus
it seems like you told me im in over my head
but all i remember is making out constantly
if i dont get out then ill probably end up dead
shes the undisputed champ of my world

chorus
down for the count over and out
toss in the towel cause she really got the best of me
i cant hang around get kicked while im down
what was that sound i just wish the fing bell would ring
