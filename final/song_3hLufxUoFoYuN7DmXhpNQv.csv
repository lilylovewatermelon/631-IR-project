they said there was no way
but they forgot the black hole in the sky
yesterday is nothing
i have half a life to rewrite
flying into this future future
i will let the science bring the change change
this will be the final cure cure
i am gonna take the past away

chorus
with the full force of a dying star
i will find you if youre near or far
wherever you are wherever you are
wherever you are wherever you are
wherever you are wherever you are
wherever you are wherever you are

verse 2
floating through forever
i am stealing the energy
endlessly endeavor
this is finding infinity
im falling through a dark sunrise dark sunrise
i will escape the entropy entropy
and find a way to leave this time this time
i will bring you back to me

with the full force
of a dying star
