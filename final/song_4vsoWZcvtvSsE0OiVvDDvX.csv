because you know a harness was only made for one
dont telegraph your passes youll end up with molasses
cauterized in syrup and syrup and molasses
and im checking out the asses the assets that attract us
to anything that moves were deep inside the grooves
and its time to shake the rations cause someones gonna cash in
the plot it turns again the reference starts at ten
well show mе a word that rhymes with pavement
and i wont kill your parеnts and roast them on a spit
and dont you try to etch it or permanently sketch it
or youre gonna catch a bad bad cold
and the freaks have stormed the white house
i moved into a lighthouse
its on a scenic quay its oh so far away
far away from the beginning the shroud is made of linen
the yearling took the purse the goth kid has a hearse
heartbreaking earthquaking
kiwis they are home baking
minds wide open truly
leisure a leisure suit is nothing
its nothing to be proud of in this late century
and im asking you to hold me just like the morning paper
pinched between your pointer your index and your thumb
its a semiautomatic believers are ecstatic
you see the way they cling the cold metallic sting
and im living in a coma for donna de varona
the harness made of hopes the lovers on the ropes
nun is to church as the parrot is to perch
and my hearts wide open
