we didnt always live on mango street before that we lived on loomis on the third floor and before that we lived on keeler before keeler it was paulina and before that i cant remember but what i remember most is moving a lot each time it seemed thered be one more of us by the time we got to mango street we were sixmama papa carlos kiki my sister nenny and me
the house on mango street is ours and we dont have to pay rent to anybody or share the yard with the people down stairs or be careful not to make too much noise and there isnt a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom but even so its not the house wed thought wed get
we had to leave the flat on loomis quick the water pipes broke and the landlord wouldnt fix them because the house was too old we had to leave fast we were using the washroom next door and carrying water over in empty milk gallons thats why mama and papa looked for a house and thats why we moved into the house on mango street far away on the other side of town
they always told us that one day we would move into a house a real that would be ours for always so we wouldnt have to move each year and our house would have running water and pipes that worked and inside it would have real stairs not hallway stairs but stairs inside like the house on tvand wed have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldnt have to tell everybody our house would be white with trees around it a great big yard and grass growing without a fence this was the house papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed
but the house on mango street is not the way they told it at all its small and red with tight steps in front and windows so small youd think they were holding their breath bricks are crumbling in places and the front door is so swollen you have to push hard to get in there is no front yard only four little elms the city planted by the curb out back is a small garage for the car we dont own yet and a small yard that looks smaller between the two buildings on either side there are stairs and the house has only one washroom everybody has to share a bedroommama and papa carlos and kiki me and nenny
once when we were living on loomis a nun from my school passed by and saw m playing out front the laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner has painted on the wood yes were open so as not to lose business

where do you live she asked
there i said pointing up to the third floor
you live there

there i had to look to where she pointedthe third floor the painting peeling wooden bars papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldnt fall out you live there the way she said it made me feel like nothing there i loved there i nodded
i knew then i had to have a house a real house one i could point to but this isnt it the house on mango street isnt it for the time being mama says temporary says papa but i know how those things go

hairs

everybody in our family has different hair my papas hair is like a broom all up in the air and me my hair is lazy it never obeys barrettes or bands carlos hair is thick and straight he doesnt need to comb it nennys hair is slippery——slides out of your hand and kiki who is the youngest has hair like fur
but my mothers hair my mothers hair like little rosettes like little candy circles all curly and pretty because she pinned it in pincurls all day sweet to put your nose into when she is holding you holding you and you feel safe is the warm smell of bread before you bake it is the smell when she makes room for you on her side of the bed still warm with her skin and you sleep near her the rain outside falling and papa snoring the snoring the rain and mamas hair that smells like bread

boys  girls

the boys and the girls live in separate worlds the
boys in their universe and we in ours my brothers for
example theyve got plenty to say to me and nenny inside
the house but outside they cant be seen talking to girls
carlos and kiki are each others best friend  not ours
nenny is too young to be my friend shes just my
sister and that was not my fault you dont pick your sisters
you just get them and sometimes they come like nenny
she cant play with those vargas kids or shell turn
out just like them and since she comes right after me she
is my responsibility
someday i will have a best friend all my own one i
can tell my secrets to one who will understand my jokes
without my having to explain them until then i am a red
balloon a balloon tied to an anchor

my name

in english my name means hope in spanish it means
too many letters it means sadness it means waiting it is
like the number nine a muddy color it is the mexican
records my father plays on sunday mornings when he is
shaving songs like sobbing
it was my greatgrandmothers name and now it is
mine she was a horse woman too born like me in the
chinese year of the horsewhich is supposed to be bad
luck if youre born femalebut i think this is a chinese
lie because the chinese like the mexicans dont like their
women strong
my greatgrandmother i wouldve liked to have known her a wild horse of a woman so wild she wouldnt
marry until my greatgrandfather threw a sack over her
head and carried her off just like that as if she were a
fancy chandelier thats the way he did it
and the story goes she never forgave him she looked i
out the window her whole life the way so many women sit
their sadness on an elbow i wonder if she made the best
with what she got or was she sorry because she couldnt be
all the things she wanted to be esperanza i have inherited
her name but i dont want to inherit her place by the
window
at school they say my name funny as if the syllables
were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth
but in spanish my name is made out of a softer something
like silver not quite as thick as sisters name magdalenawhich is uglier than mine magdalena who at
least can come home and become nenny but i am always
esperanza
i would like to baptize myself under a new name a
name more like the real me the one nobody sees esperanza
as lisandra or maritza or zeze the x yes something
like zeze the x will do

cathy queen of cats
she says i am the great great grand cousin of the
queen of france she lives upstairs over there next door
to joe the babygrabber keep away from him she says
he is full of danger benny and blanca own the comer
store theyre okay except dont lean on the candy counter
two girls raggedy as rats live across the street you dont
want to know them edna is the lady who owns the building
next to you she used to own a building big as a whale but
her brother sold it their mother said no no dont ever
sell it i wont and then she closed her eyes and he sold
it alicia is stuckup ever since she went to college she used
to like me but now she doesnt
cathy who is queen of cats has cats and cats and cats
baby cats big cats skinny cats sick cats cats asleep like
little donuts cats on top of the refrigerator cats taking a
walk on the dinner table her house is like cat heaven
you want a friend she says okay ill be your friend
but only till next tuesday thats when we move away
got to then as if she forgot i just moved in she says the
neighborhood is getting bad
cathys father will have to fly to france one day and
find her great great distant grand cousin on her fathers
side and inherit the family house how do i know this is
so she told me so in the meantime theyll just have to
move a little farther north from mango street a little farther
away every time people like us keep moving in
our good day

if you give me five dollars i will be your friend forever
thats what the little one tells me
five dollars is cheap since i dont have any friends
except cathy who is only my friend till tuesday
five dollars five dollars
she is trying to get somebody to chip in so they can
buy a bicycle from this kid named tito they already have
ten dollars and all they need is five more
only five dollars she says
don talk to them says cathy cant you see they smell
like a broom
but i like them their clothes are crooked and old they are wearing shiny sunday shoes without socks it
makes their bald ankles all red but i like them especially
the big one who laughs with all her teeth i like her even
though she lets the little one do all the talking
five dollars the little one says only five 
cathy is tugging my arm and i know whatever i do
next will make her mad forever
wait a minute i say and run inside to get the five
dollars i have three dollars saved and i take two of nennys
shes not home but im sure shell he glad when she
finds out we own a bike when i get back cathy is gone
like i knew she would be but i dont care i have two new
friends and a bike too
my name is lucy the big one says this here is rachel
my sister
im her sister says rachel who are you
and i wish my name was cassandra or alexis or maritzaanything
but esperanzabut when i tell them my
name they dont laugh
we come from texas lucy says and grins her was
born here but me im texas
you mean she i say
no 111 from texas and doesnt get it
this bike is three ways ours says rachel who is thinking
ahead already mine today lucys tomorrow and yours
day after
but everybody wants to ride it today because the bike
is new so we decide to take turns after tomorrow today
it belongs to all of us
i dont tell them about nenny just yet its too complicated
especially since rachel almost put out lucys eye
about who was going to get to ride it first but finally we
agree to ride it together why not
because lucy has long legs she pedals i sit on the back seat and rachel is skinny enough to get up on the
handlebars which makes the bike all wobbly as if the wheels
are spaghetti hut after a bit you get used to it
we ride fast and faster past my house sad and red
and crumbly in places past mr bennys grocery on the
corner and down the avenue which is dangerous laundromat junkstore drugstore windows and cars and more
cars and around the block back to mango
people on the bus wave a very fat lady crossing the
street says you sure got quite a load there
rachel shouts you got quite a load there too she is
very sassy
down down mango street we go rachel lucy me
our new bicycle laughing the crooked ride back

laughter
nenny and i dont look like sisters  not right away
not the way you can tell with rachel and lucy who have
the same fat popside lips like everybody else in their family
but me and nenny we are more alike than you would
know our laughter for example not the shy ice cream
bells giggle of rachel and lucys family but all ofa sudden
and surprised like a pile of dishes breaking and other
things i cant explain
one day we were passing a house that looked in my
mind like houses i had seen in mexico i dont know why
there was nothing about the house that looked exactly like the homes i remembered im not even sure why i thought it but it seemed to feel right
look at that house i said it looks like mexico
rachel and lucy look at me like im crazy but before
lucy can let out a laugh nenny says yes thats mexico all
right thats what i was thinking exactly

gils furniture bought  sold

there is a junk store an old man owns it we bought
a used refrigerator from him once and carlos sold a box
of magazines for a dollar the store is small with just a
dirty window for light he doesnt turn the lights on unless
you got money to buy things with so in the dark we look
and see all kinds of things me and nenny tables with
their feet upsidedown and rows and rows of refrigerators
with round corners and couches that spin dust in the air
when you punch them and a hundred tvs that dont
work probably everything is on top of everything so the
whole store has skinny aisles to walk through you can get
lost easy
the owner he is a black man who doesnt talk much
and sometimes if you didnt know better you could be in there a long time before your eyes notice a pair of gold glasses floating in the dark nenny who thinks she is smart and talks to any old man asks lots of questions me i never
said nothing to him except once when i bought the statue
of liberty for a dime
but nenny i hear her asking one time hows this here
and the man says this this is a music box and i turn
around quick thinking he means a pretty box with flowers
painted on it with a ballerina inside only theres nothing
like that where this old man is pointing just a wood box
thats old and got a big brass record in it with holes then
he starts it up and all sorts of things start happening its
like all of a sudden he let go a million moths all over the
dusty furniture and swanneck shadows and in our bones
its like drops of water or like marimbas only with a funny
little plucked sound to it like if you were running your
fingers across the teeth of a metal comb
and then i dont know why but i have to turn around
and pretend i dont care about the box so nenny wont see
how stupid i am but nenny who is stupider already is
asking how much and i can see her fingers going for the
quarters in her pants pocket

this the old man says shutting the lid this aint for
sale

meme ortiz

meme ortiz moved into cathys house after her family
moved away his name isnt really meme his name isjuan
but when we asked him what his name was he said meme
and thats what everybody calls him except his mother
meme has a dog with gray eyes a sheepdog with two
names one in english and one in spanish the dog is big
like a man dressed in a dog suit and runs the same way
its owner does clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping
allover the place like untied shoes

cathys father built the house meme moved into it
is wooden inside the floors slant some rooms uphill some
down and there are no closets out front there are twenty one steps all lopsided and jutting like crooked teeth made
that way on purpose cathy said so the rain will slide off
and when memes mama calls from the doorway meme goes scrambling up the twentyone wooden stairs with the
dog with two names scrambling after him

around the back is a yard mostly dirt and a greasy
bunch of boards that used to be a garage but what you
remember most is this tree huge with fat arms and mighty
families of squirrels in the higher branches all around
me neighborhood of roofs blacktarred and aframed
and in their gutters the balls that never came back down
to earth down at the base of the tree the dog with two
names barks into the empty air and there at the end of
the block looking smaller still our house with its feet
tucked under like a cat
this is the tree we chose for the first annual tarzan
jumping contest meme won and broke both arms

louie his cousin  his other cousin

downstairs from memes is a basement apartment that
memes mother fixed up and rented to a puerto rican
family louies family louie is the oldest in a family of
little sisters he is my brothers friend really but i know
he has two cousins and that his tshirts never stay tucked
in his pants
louies girl cousin is older than us she lives with
louies family because her own family is in puerto rico
her name is marin or maris or something like that and
she wears dark nylons all the time and lots of makeup she
gets free from selling avon she cant come outgotta
babysit with louies sistersbut she stands in the doorway a lot all the time singing clicking her fingers the same song

apples peaches pumpkin pahay
youre in love and so am ahay

louie has another cousin we only saw him once but
it was important we were playing volleyball in the alley
when he drove up in this great big yellow cadillac with
whitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror
louies cousin had his arm out the window he honked a
couple of times and a lot of faces looked out from louies
back window and then a lot of people came outlouie
marin and all the little sisters
everybody looked inside the car and asked where he
got it there were white rugs and white leather seats we
all asked for a ride and asked where he got it louies cousin
said get in
we each had to sit with one of louies little sisters on
our lap but that was okay the seats were big and soft like
a sofa and there was a little white cat in the back window
whose eyes lit up when the car stopped or turned the
windows didnt roll up like in ordinary cars instead there
was a button that did it for you automatically we rode up
the alley and around the block six times but louies cousin
said he was going to make us walk home if we didnt stop
playing with the windows or touching the fm radio
the seventh time we drove into the alley we heard
sirens  real quiet at first but then louder louies cousin
stopped the car right where we were and said everybody
out of the car then he took off flooring that car into a
yellow blur we hardly had time to think when the cop car
pulled in the alley going just as fast we saw the yellow
cadillac at the end of the block trying to make a lefthand
turn but our alley is too skinny and the car hashed into
a lamppost
marin screamed and we ran down the block to where
the cop cars siren spun a dizzy blue the nose of that yellow
cadillac was all pleated like an alligators and except for
a bloody lip and a bruised forehead louies cousin was
okay they put handcuffs on him and put him in the backseat
of the cop car and we all waved as they drove away

marin

marins boyfriend is in puerto rico she shows us his
letters and makes us promise not to tell anybody theyre
getting married when she goes back to pr she says he
didnt get a job yet but shes saving the money she gets
from selling avon and taking care of her cousins
marin says that if she stays here next year shes going
to get a real job downtown because thats where the best
jobs are since you always get to look beautiful and get to
wear nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who
might marry you and take you to live in a big house far
away
but next year louies parents are going to send her back to her mother with a letter saying shes too much
trouble and that is too bad because i like marin she is
older and knows lots of things she is the one who told us
how davey the babys sister got pregnant and what cream
is best for taking off moustache hair and if you count the
white flecks on your fingernails you can know how many
boys are thinking of you and lots of other things i cant
remember now
we never see marin until her aunt comes home from 
work and even then she can only stay out in front she is
there every night with the radio when the light in her
aunts room goes out marin lights a cigarette and it doesnt
matter if its cold out or if the radio doesnt work or if weve
got nothing to say to each other what matters marin says
is for the boys to see us and for us to see them and since
marins skirts are shorter and since her eyes are pretty
and since marin is already older than us in many ways the
boys who do pass by say stupid things like i am in love with
those two green apples you call eyes give them to me why
dont you and marin just looks at them without even blinking and is not afraid
marin under the streetlight dancing by herself is
singing the same song somewhere i know is waiting for
a car to stop a star to fall someone to change her life

those who dont

those who dont know any better come into our neighborhood
scared they think were dangerous they think
we will attack them with shiny knives they are stupid
people who are lost and got here by mistake
but we arent afraid we know the guy with the crooked
eye is davey the babys brother and the tall one next to
him in the straw brim thats rosas eddie v and the big
one that looks like a dumb grown man hes fat boy though
hes not fat anymore nor a boy
all brown all around we are safe but watch us drive
into a neighborhood of another color and our knees go
shakityshake and our car windows get rolled up tight and
our eyes look straight yeah that is how it goes and goes

there was an old woman she had so many children she didnt know what to do

rosa vargas kids are too many and too much its
not her fault you know except she is their mother and
only one against so many
they are bad those vargases and how can they help
it with only one mother who is tired all the time from
buttoning and bottling and babying and who cries every
day for the man who left without even leaving a dollar for bologna or a note explaining how come
the kids bend trees and bounce between cars and
dangle upside down from knees and almost break like
fancy museum vases you cant replace they think its
funny they are without respect for all things living including themselves
but after a while you get tired of being worried about
kids who arent even yours one day they are playing
chicken on mr bennys roof mr benny says hey aint
you kids know better than to he swinging up there come
down you come down right now and then they just spit
see thats what i mean no wonder everybody gave
up just stopped looking out when little efren chipped his
buck tooth on a parking meter and didnt even stop refugia
from getting her head stuck between two slats in the back
gate and nobody looked up not once the day angel vargas
learned to fly and dropped from the sky like a sugar donut
just like a failing star and exploded down to earth without
even an oh

alicia who sees mice

close your eyes and theyll go away her father says
or youre just imagining and anyway a womans place is
sleeping so she can wake up early with the tortilla star the
one that appears early just in time to rise and catch the
hind legs hide behind the sink beneath the fourclawed
tub under the swollen floorboards nobody fixes in the
corner of your eyes
alicia whose mama died is sorry there is no one older
to rise and make the lunchbox tortillas alicia who inherited
her mamas rolling pin and sleepiness is young and
smart and studies for the first time at the university two
trains and a bus because she doesnt want to spend her whole life in a factory or behind a rolling pin is a good
girl my friend studies all night and sees the mice the ones
her father says do not exist is afraid of nothing except
fourlegged fur and fathers

darius  the clouds

you can never have too much sky you can fall asleep
and wake up drunk on sky and sky can keep you safe when
you are sad here there is too much sadness and not
enough sky butterflies too are few and so are flowers and
most things that are beautiful still we take what we can
get and make the best of it
darius who doesnt like school who is sometimes stupid
and mostly a fool said something wise today though
most days he says nothing darius who chases girls with
firecrackers or a stick that touched a rat and thinks hes
tough today pointed up because the world was full of
clouds the kind like pillows

the family of little feet

there was a family all were little their arms were
little and their hands were little and their height was not
tall and their feet very small
the grandpa slept on the living room couch and
snored through his teeth his feet were fat and doughy
like thick tamales and these he powdered and stuffed into white socks and brown leather shoes
the grandmas feet were lovely as pink pearls and
dressed in velvety high heels that made her walk with a
wobble but she wore them anyway because they were
pretty
the babys feet had ten tiny toes pale and seethrough like a salamanders and these he popped into his mouth
whenever he was hungry
the mothers feet plump and polite descended like
i white pigeons from the sea of pillow across the linoleum
roses down down the wooden stairs over the chalk hopscotch
squares 56 7 blue sky
do you want this and gave us a paper bag with one
pair of lemon shoes and one red and one pair of dancing shoes that used to be white but were now pale blue
here and we said thank you and waited until she went
upstairs hurray today we are cinderella because our feet fit
exactly and we laugh





a rice sandwich

the special kids the ones who wear keys around their
necks get to eat in the canteen the canteen even the
name sounds important and these kids at lunch time go
there because their mothers arent home or horne is too
far away to get to
my home isnt far but its not close either and somehow
i got it in my head one day to ask my mother to make
me a sandwich and write a note to the principal so i could
eat in the canteen too
oh no she says pointing the butter knife at me as if
im starting trouble no sir next thing you know everybody
will be wanting a bag lunchill be up all night cuttingbrad into little triangles this one with mayonnaise this
one with mustard no pickles on mine but mustard on one
side please you kids just like to invent more work for me
but nenny says she doesnt want to eat at schooleverbecause
she likes to go horne with her best friend
gloria who lives across the schoolyard glorias mama has
it big color tv and all they do is watch cartoons kiki and
carlos on the other hand are patrol boys they dont want
to eat at school either they like to stand out in the cold
especially if its raining they think suffering is good for
you ever since they saw that movie 300 spartans
im no spartan and hold up an anemic wrist to prove
it i cant even blow up a balloon without getting dizzy
and besides i know how to make my own lunch if i ate
at school thered be less dishes to wash you would see me
less and less and like me better everyday at noon my chair
would be empty where is my favorite daughter you would
cry and when i came home finally at three pm you would
appreciate me
okay okay my mother says after three days of this
and the following morning i get to go to school with my
mothers letter and a rice sandwich because we dont have lunch meat  mondays or fridays it doesnt matter mornings always
go by slow and this day especially but lunchtime
came finally and i got to get in line with the stayatschool
kids everything is fine until the nun who knows all the
canteen kids by heart looks at me and says you who sent
you here and since i am shy i dont say anything just
hold out my hand with the letter this is no good she says
till sister superior gives the okay go upstairs and see her
and so i went
i had to wait for two kids in front of me to get hollered
at one because he did something in class the other because he didnt my turn came and i stood in front of the big
desk with holy pictures under the glass while the sister
superior read my letter it went like this

dear sister superior
please let esperanza eat in the lunchroom
because she lives too far away and she gets tired
as you can see she is very skinny i hope to god
she does not faint
thanking you
mrs e cordero

you dont live far she says you live across the boulevard
thats only four blocks not even three maybe
three long blocks away from here i bet i can see your
house from my window which one come here which
one is your house
and then she made me stand up on a box of books
and point that one she said pointing to a row of ugly
threeflats the ones even the raggedy men are ashamed to
go into yes i nodded even though i knew that wasnt my
house and started to cry i always cry when nuns yell at
me even if theyre not yelling
then she was sorry and said i could stayjust for
today not tomorrow or the day afteryou go home and
i said yes and could i please have a kleenexi had to
blow my nose
in the canteen which was nothing special lots of boys
and girls watched while i cried and ate my sandwich the
bread already greasy and the rice cold

everybody laughing except me because im wearing
the new dress pink and white with stripes and new underclothes
and new socks and the old saddle shoes i wear
to school brown and white the kind i get every september
because they last long and they do my feet scuffed and
round and the heels all crooked that look dumb with this
dress so i just sit
meanwhile that boy who is my cousin by first communion
or something asks me to dance and i cant just
stuff my feet under the metal folding chair stamped precious
blood and pick on a wad of brown gum thats stuck
beneath the seat i shake my head no my feet growing
bigger and bigger
then uncle nacho is pulling and pulling my arm and
it doesnt matter how new the dress mama bought is because
my feet are ugly until my uncle who is a liar says
you are the prettiest girl here will you dance but i believe
him and yes we are dancing my uncle nacho and me
only i dont want to at first my feet swell big and heavy
like plungers but i drag them across the linoleum roor
straight center where uncle wants to show off the new
dance we learned and uncle spins me and my skinny
arms bend the way he taught me and my mother watches
and my little cousins watch and the boy who is my cousin
by first communion watches and everyone says wow who
are those two who dance like in the movies until i forget
that i am wearing only ordinary shoes brown and white
the kind my mother buys each year for school
and all i hear is the clapping when the music stops
my uncle and me bow and he walks me back in my thick
shoes to my mother who is proud to be my mother all
night the boy who is a man watches me dance he watched
me dance

hips
i like coffee i like tea

ilike the boys and the boys like me

yes no maybe so yes no maybe so 

one day you wake up and they are there ready and
waiting like a new buick with the keys in the ignition ready
to take you where
theyre good for holding a baby when youre cooking
rachel says turning the jump rope a little quicker she has
no imagination
you need them to dance says lucy

if you dont get them you may turn into a man nenny believes this and she believes it she is this way because of her
age
thats right i add before lucy or rachel can make
fun of her she is stupid alright but she is my sister
but most important hips are scientific i say repeating
what alicia already told me its the bones that let you know
which skeleton was a mans when it was a man and which
a womans
they bloom like roses i continue because its obvious
im the only one who can speak with any authority i have
science on my side the bones just one day open just like
that one day you might decide to have kids and then
where are you going to put them got to have room bones
got to give
but dont have too many or your behind will spread
thats how it is says rachel whose mama is as wide as a
boat and we just laugh what im saying is who here is ready you gotta be
able to know what to do with hips when you get them i
say making it up as i go you gotta know how to walk with
hips practice you knowlike if half of you wanted to go
one way and the other half the other
thats to lullaby it nenny says thats to rock the baby
asleep inside you and then she begins singing seashells
copper bells eroy ivy over
im about to tell her thats the dumbest thing ive ever
heard but the more i think about it 
you gotta get the rhythm and lucy begins to dance
she has the idea though shes having trouble keeping her
end of the doubledutch steady
its gotta be just so i say not too fast and not too
slow not too fast and not too slow
we slow the double circles down to a certain speed so
rachel who has just jumped in can practice shaking it
i want to shake like hoochicoochie lucy says she is
crazy
i want to move like heebiejeebie i say picking up on
the cue
i want to be tahiti or merengue or electricity
or tembleque
yes tembleque thats a good one
and then its rachel who starts it
skip sjcip

snake in your hips

wiggle around

and break your lip

lucy waits a minute before her turn she is thinking
then she begins
the waitress with the big fat hips

who pays the rent with taxi tips   

says nobody in town will kiss her on the lips

because  

because she looks like christopher columbus

yes no maybe so yes no maybe so

she misses on maybe so i take a little while before

my turn take a breath and dive in

some are skinny like chuken lips

some are baggy like soggy bandaids

after you get out of the bathtub

i dont care what kind i get

just as long as i get hips

everybody getting into it now except nenny who is

still humming not a girl not a boy just a little baby shes like

that

when the two arcs open wide like jaws nenny jumps in across from me the rope tickticking the little gold
earrings our mama gave her for her first holy communion
bouncing she is the color of a bar of naphtha laundry
soap she is like the little brown piece left at the end of the
wash the hard little bone my sister her mouth opens
she begins

my mother and your mother were washing clothes
my mother punched your mother right in the nese
what color blood came out1
not that old song i say you gotta use your own song
make it up you know but she doesnt get it or wont its
hard to say which the rope turning turning turning
engine engine number nine
running down chicago line
if the train runs off the track
do you want your money back
do you want your money back
yes no maybe so yes no maybe so 

i can tell lucy and rachel are disgusted but they
dont say anything because shes my sister
yes no maybe so yes no maybe so  
nenny i say but she doesnt hear me she is too many
lightyears away she is in a world we dont belong to anymore
nenny going going
yes spells yes and out you go



the first job  will

it wasnt as if i didnt want to work i did i had even
gone to the social security office the month before to get
my social security number i needed money the catholic
high school cost a lot and papa said nobody went to public
school unless you wanted to turn out bad
i thought id find an easy job the kind other kids
had working in the dime store or maybe a hotdog stand
and though i hadnt started looking yet i thought i might
the week after next but when i came home that afternoon
all wet because tito had pushed me into the open water
hydrantonly i had sort of let himmama called me in
the kitchen before i could even go and change and auntla1a  sitting there drinking her coffee with a spoon
aunt lala said she had found a job for me at the peter
pan photo finishers on north broadway where she
worked and how old was i and to show up tomorrow
saying i was one year older and that was that
so the next morning i put on the navy blue dress that
made me look older and borrowed money for lunch and
bus fare because aunt lala said i wouldnt get paid till the
next friday and i went in and saw the boss of the peter
pan photo finishers on north broadway where aunt lala
worked and lied about my age like she told me to and sure
enough i started that same day
in my job i had to wear white gloves i was supposed
to match negatives with their prints just look at the picture
and look for the same one on the negative strip put it in
the envelope and do the next one thats all i didnt know
where these envelopes were coming from or where they
were going i just did what i was told
it was real easy and i guess i wouldnt have minded
it except that you got tired after a while and i didnt know
if i could sit down or not and then i started sitting down
only when the two ladies next to me did after a while they
started to laugh and came up to me and said i could sit
when i wanted to and i said i knew
when lunchtime came i was scared to eat alone in
the company lunchroom with all those men and ladies looking
so i ate real fast standing in one of the washroom stalls
and had lots of time left over so i went back to work early
but then break time came and not knowing where else to
go i went into the coatroom because there was a bench
there
i guess it was the time for the night shift or middle
shift to arrive because a few people came in and punched
the time clock and an older oriental man said hello andwe talked for a while about my just starting and he said
we could be friends and next time to go in the lunchroom
and sit with him and i felt better he had nice eyes and 1
didnt feel so nervous anymore then he asked if 1 knew
what day it was and when i said 1 didnt he said it was his
birthday and would i please give him a birthday kiss 1
thought i would because he was so old and just as i was
about to put my lips on his cheek he grabs my face with
both hands and kisses me hard on the mouth and doesnt
let go


papa who wakes up tired in the dark

your abuelito is dead papa says early one morning
in my room esta muerto and then as if he just heard the
news himself crumples like a coat and cries my brave papa
cries i have never seen my papa cry and dont know what
to do
i know he will have to go away that he will take a
plane to mexico all the uncles and aunts will be there and
they will have a blackandwhite photo taken in front of
the tomb with flowers shaped like spears in a white vase
because this is how they send the dead away in that country
because i am the oldest my father has told me first
and now it is my turn to tell the others i will have to explain why we cant play i will have to tell them to be quiet today
my papa his thick hands and thick shoes who wakes
up tired in the dark who combs his hair with water drinks
his coffee and is gone before we wake today is sitting on
my bed
and i think if my own papa died what would i do i
hold my papa in my arms i hold and hold and hold him



born bad

most likely i will go to hell and most likely i deserve
to be there my mother says i was born on an evil day and
prays for me lucy and rachel pray too for ourselves and
for each other  because of what we did to aunt lupe
her name was guadalupe and she was pretty like my
mother dark good to look at in her joan crawford dress
and swimmers legs aunt lupe of the photographs
but i knew her sick from the disease that would not
go her legs bunched under the yellow sheets the bones
gone limp as worms the yellow pillow the yellow smell
the bottles and spoons her head thrown back like a thirsty
lady my aunt the swimmer
hard to imagine her legs once strong the bones hard
and parting water clean sharp strokes not bent and wrinkled like a baby not drowning under the sticky yellow light
secondfloor rear apartment the naked light bulb the
high ceilings the light bulb always burning
i dont know who decides who deserves to go bad i
there was no evil in her birth no wicked curse one day  i believe she was swimming and the next day she was sick
it might have been the day that gray photograph was taken
it might have been the day she was holding cousin totchy
and baby frank it might have been the moment she
pointed to the camera for the kids to look and they
wouldnt
maybe the sky didnt look the day she fell down
maybe god was busy it could be true she didnt dive right
one day and hurt her spine or maybe the story that she
fell very hard from a high step stool like totchy said is
true
but i think diseases have no eyes they pick with a
dizzy finger anyone just anyone like my aunt who happened
to be walking down the street one day in her joan 
crawford dress in her funny felt hat with the black feather
cousin totchy in one hand baby frank in the other
sometimes you get used to the sick and sometimes
the sickness if it is there too long gets to seem normal
this is how it was with her and maybe this is why we chose
her
it was a game thats all it was the game we played
every afternoon ever since that day one of us invented it
cant remember whoi think it was me
you had to pick somebody you had to think of someone
everybody knew someone you could imitate and
everyone else would have to guess who it was it started
out with famous people wonder woman the beatles
marilyn monroe but then somebody thought itd be better if we changed the game a little if we pretended we were mr benny or his wife blanca or ruthie or anybody we knew
i dont know why we picked her maybe we were bored
that day maybe we got tired we liked my aunt she listened
to our stories she always asked us to come back
lucy me rachel i hated to go there alone the six blocks
to the dark apartment secondfloor rear building where
sunlight never came and what did it matter my aunt was
blind by then she never saw the dirty dishes in the sink
she couldnt see the ceilings dusty with flies the ugly maroon walls the bottles and sticky spoons i cant forget the smell like sticky capsules filled with jelly my aunt a little oyster a little piece of meat on an open shell for us to look at hello hello as if she had fallen into a well
i took my library books to her house i read her stories
i liked the book the waterbabies she liked it too i
never knew how sick she was until that day i tried to show
her one of the pictures in the book a beautiful color picture
of the water babies swimming in the sea i held the book
up to her face i cant see it she said im blind and then
i was ashamed
she listened to every book every poem i read her
one day i read her one of my own i came very dose i
whispered it into the pillow
i want to be
like the waves on the sea
like the douds in the wind
but im me
one day ill jump
out of my skin
ill shake the sky
like a hundred violins
thats nice thats very good she said in her tired voice
you just remember to keep writing speranza you must
keep writing it will keep you free and i said yes but at
that time i didnt know what she meant
the day we played the game we didnt know she was
going to die we pretended with our heads thrown back
our arms limp and useless dangling like the dead we
laughed the way she did we talked the way she talked the
way blind people talk without moving their head we imitated
the way you had to lift her head a little so she could
drink water she sucked it up slow out of a green tin cup
the water was warm and tasted like metal lucy laughed
rachel too we took turns being her we screamed in the
weak voice of a parrot for totchy to come and wash those
dishes it was easy
we didnt know she had been dying such a long time
we forgot maybe she was ashamed maybe she was embarrassed
it took so many years the kids who wanted to
be kids instead of washing dishes and ironing their papas
shirts and the husband who wanted a wife again
and then she died my aunt who listened to my poems
and then we began to dream the dreams

elenita cards palm water

elenita witch woman wipes the table with a rag because
ernie who is feeding the baby spilled koolaid she
says take that crazy baby out of here and drink your koolaid

edna’s ruthie


ruthie tall skinny lady with red lipstick and blue babushka
one blue sock and one green because she forgot
is the only grownup we know who likes to play she takes
her dog bobo for a walk and laughs all by herself that
ruthie she doesnt need anybody to laugh with she just laughs
she is ednas daughter the lady who owns the big
building next door three apartments front and back every
week edna is screaming at somebody and every week
somebody has to move away once she threw out a pregnant
lady just because she owned a duck  and it was a nice duck too but ruthie lives here and edna cant throw
her out because ruthie is her daurhter
ruthie came one day it seemed out of nowhere
anrei vargas was trying to teach us how to whistle then
i we heard someone whistlingbeautiful like the emperors
nightingaleand when we turned around there was
ruthie
sometimes we go shopping and take her with us but
she never comes inside the stores and if she does she keeps
looking around her like a wild animal in a house for the
first time
she likes candy when we go to mr bennys grocery
she gives us money to buy her some she says make sure
its the soft kind because her teeth hurt then she promises
to see the dentist next week but when next week comes
she doesnt go
ruthie sees lovely things everywhere i might be telling
her ajoke and shell stop and say the moon is beautiful
like a balloon or somebody might be singing and shell point to a few clouds look marlon brando or a sphinx
winking or my left shoe
once some friends of ednas came to visit and asked
ruthie if she wanted to go with them to play bingo the
car motor was running and ruthie stood on the steps
wondering whether to go should i go ma she asked the
gray shadow behind the secondroor screen i dont care
says the screen go if you want ruthie looked at the ground what do you think ma do what you want how
should i know ruthie looked at the ground some more
the car with the motor running waited fifteen minutes
and then they left when we brought out the deck of cards
that night we let ruthie deal
there were many things ruthie could have been if
she wanted to not only is she a good whistler but she can
sing and dance too she had lots of job offers when she
was young but she never took them she got married in­stead and moved away to a pretty house outside the city
only thing i cant understand is why ruthie is living on
mango street if she doesnt have to why is she sleeping on
a couch in her mothers living room when she has a real
house all her own but she says shes just visiting and next weekend her husbands going to take her home but the weekends come and go and ruthie stays no matter we are glad because she is our friend
i like showing ruthie the books i take out of the library books are wonderful ruthie says and then she
runs her hand over them as if she could read them in
braille theyre wonderful wonderful but i cant read anymore
i get headaches i need to go to the eye doctor next
week i used to write childrens books once did i tell you
one day i memorized all of the walrus and the
carpenter because i wanted ruthie to hear me the sun
was shining on the sea shining with all his might 
ruthie looked at the sky and her eyes got watery at times
finally i came to the last lines but answer came there
noneand this was scarcely odd because theyd eaten
everyone  she took a long time looking at me before
she opened her mouth and then she said you have the
most beautiful teeth i have ever seen and went inside

the earl of tennessee

earl lives next door in ednas basement behind the
flower boxes edna paints green each year behind the dusty
geraniums we used to sit on the flower boxes until the day
tito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head
now we sit on the steps that swing around the basement
apartment where earl lives
earl works nights his blinds are always closed during
the day sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet
the little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for
so long opens with a sigh and lets out a breath of mold
and dampness like books that have been left out in the
rain this is the only time we see earl except for when he
comes and goes to work he has two little black dogs that
go everywhere with him they dont walk like ordinary
dogs but leap and somersault like an apostrophe and
comma f at night nenny and i can hear when earl comes home 
from work first the click and whine of the car door open­ f
ing then the scrape of concrete the excited tinkling of dog
tags followed by the heavy jingling of keys and finally the
moan of the wooden door as it opens and lets loose its sigh
of dampness
earl is a jukebox repairman he learned his trade in
the south he says he speaks with a southern accent
smokes fat cigars and wears a felt hatwinter or summer
hot or cold dont mattera felt hat in his apartment are
boxes and boxes of 45 records moldy and damp like the
smell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens
the door he gives the records away to usall except the
country and western
the word is that earl is married and has a wife somewhere
edna says she saw her once when earl brought her
to the apartment mama says she is a skinny thing blond
and pale like salamanders that have never seen the sun
but i saw her once too and shes not that way at all and
the boys across the street say she is a tall redheaded lady
who wears tight pink pants and green glasses we never
agree on what she looks like but we do know this whenever
she arrives he holds her tight by the crook of the
arm they walk fast into the apartment lock the door
behind them and never stay long

sire

i dont remember when i first noticed him looking at
mesire but i knew he was looking every time all the
time i walked past his house him and his friends sitting
on their bikes in front of the house pitching pennies they
didnt scare me they did but i wouldnt let them know
i dont cross the street like other girls straight ahead
straight eyes i walked past i knew he was looking i had
to prove to me i wasnt scared of nobodys eyes not even
his i had to look back hard just once like he was glass
and i did i did once but i looked too long when he rode
his bike past me i looked because i wanted to be brave
straight into the dusty cat fur of his eyes and the bike
stopped and he bumped into a parked car bumped and
i walked fast it made your blood freeze to have somebody
look at you like that somebody looked at me somebody
looked but his kind his ways he is a punk papa says
and mama says not to talk to him
and then his girlfriend came lois i heard him call
her she is tiny and pretty and smells like babys skin i see
her sometimes running to the store for him and once
when she was standing next to me at mr bennys grocery
she was barefoot and i saw her barefoot baby toenails all
painted pale pale pink like little pink seashells and she
smells pink like babies do shes got big girl hands and her
bones are long like ladies bones and she wears makeup
too but she doesnt know how to tie her shoes i do
sometimes i hear them laughing late beer cans and
cats and the trees talking to themselves wait wait wait
sire lets lois ride his bike around the block or they take
walks together i watch them she holds his hand and he
stops sometimes to tie her shoes but mama says those kinds
of girls those girls are the ones that go into alleys lois
who cant tie her shoes where does he take her
everything is holding its breath inside me everything
is waiting to explode like christmas i want to be all new
and shiny i want to sit out bad at night a boy around my
neck and the wind under my skirt not this way every
evening talking to the trees leaning out my window imagining
what i cant see
a boy held me once so hard i swear i felt the grip
and weight of his arms but it was a dream
sire how did you hold her was it like this and
when you kissed her like this



four skinny trees


they are the only ones who understand me i am the
only one who understands them four skinny trees with
skinny necks and pointy elbows like mine four who do
not belong here but are here four raggedy excuses planted
by the city from our room we can hear them but nenny
just sleeps and doesnt appreciate these things
their strength is secret they send ferocious roots
beneath the ground they grow up and they grow down
and grab the earth between their hairy toes and bite the
sky with violent teeth and never quit their anger this is
how they keep
let one forget his reason for being theyd all droop like tulips in a glass each with their arms around the other
keep keep keep trees say when i sleep they teach
when i am too sad and too skinny to keep keeping
when i am a tiny thing against so many bricks then it is i
look at trees when there is nothing left to look at on this
street four who grew despite concrete four who reach i
and do not forget to reach four whose only reason is to
 be and be


no speak english


mamacita is the big mama of the man across the street
thirdfloor front rachel says her name ought to be mamasota
but i think thats mean
the man saved his money to bring her here he saved
and saved because she was alone with the baby boy in that
country he worked two jobs he came home late and he
left early every day
then one day mamacita and the baby boy arrived
in a yellow taxi the taxi door opened like a waiters
arm out stepped a tiny pink shoe a foot soft as a rabbits
ear then the thick ankle a rutter of hips fuchsia
roses and green perfume the man had to pull her
the taxicab driver had to push push pull push pull
poof
all at once she bloomed huge enormous beautiful
to look at from the salmonpink feather on the tip of her
hat down to the little rosebuds of her toes i couldnt take
my eyes off her tiny shoes
up up up the stairs she went with the baby boy in a
blue blanket the man carrying her suitcases her lavender
hatboxes a dozen boxes of satin high heels then we didnt
see her
somebody said because shes too fat somebody because
of the three flights of st3irs but i believe she doesnt
come out because she is afraid to speak english and maybe
this is so since she only knows eight words she knows to
say he not here for when the landlord comes no speak
english if anybody else comes and holy smokes i dont know
where she learned this but i heard her say it one time and
it surprised me
my father says when he came to this country he ate
hamandeggs for three months breakfast lunch and dinner
hamandeggs that was the only word he knew he
doesnt eat hamandeggs anymore
whatever her reasons whether she is fat or cant
climb the stairs or is afraid of english she wont come
down she sits all day by the window and plays the spanish
radio show and sings all the homesick songs about her
 country in a voice that sounds like a seagull
home home home is a house in a photograph a
pink house pink as hollyhocks with lots of startled light
the man paints the walls of the apartment pink but its
not the same you know she still sighs for her pint house
and then i think she cries i would
sometimes the man gets disgusted he starts screaming
and you can hear it all the way down the street
ay she says she is sad
oh he says not again
ctuindo ctuindo ctuindor she asks i
i
f jay caray we are home this is home here i am and
here i stay speak english speak english christ
jay mamacita who does not belong every once in a
while lets out a cry hysterical high as if he had torn the
only skinny thread that kept her alive the only road out
to that country
and then to break her heart forever the baby boy
who has begun to talk starts to sing the pepsi commercial
he heard on tv
no speak english she says to the child who is singing
in the language that sounds like tin no speak english no
speak english and bubbles into tears no no no as if she
cant believe her ears

rafaela who drinks coconut  papaya juice on tuesday

on tuesdays rafaelas husband comes home late because
thats the night he plays dominoes and then rafaela
who is still young but getting old from leaning out the
window so much gets locked indoors because her husband
is afraid rafaela will run away since she is too beautiful to
look at
rafaela leans out the window and leans on her elbow
and dreams her hair is like rapunzels on the corner there
is music from the bar and rafaela wishes she could go
there and dance before she gets old
a long time passes and we forget she is up there
watching until she says kids if i give you a dollar will you go to the store and buy me something she throws a crumpled
donar down and always asks for coconut or sometimes
papaya juice and we send it up to her in a paper shopping
bag she lets down with clothesline
rafaela who drinks and drinks coconut and papaya juice on tuesdays and wishes there were sweeter drinks
not bitter like an empty room but sweet sweet like the island like the dance hall down the street where women
much older than her throw green eyes easily like dice and
open homes with keys and always there is someone offering sweeter drinks someone promising to keep them
on a silver string

sally


sally is  the girl with eyes like egypt and nylons the
color of smoke the boys at school think shes beautiful
because her hair is shiny black like raven feathers and when she laughs she flicks her hair back like a satin shawl over

are very strict in his religion they are not supposed to
dance he remembers his sisters and is sad then she cant

tuesday before easter not since the day you made her ear
bleed not since she called you that name and bit a hole in
your arm and you looked as if you were going to cry and
everyone was waiting and you didnt you didnt sally not
since then you dont have a best friend to lean against the
schoolyard fence with to laugh behind your hands at what
the boys say there is no one to lend you her hairbrush
the stories the boys tell in the coatroom theyre not
true you lean against the schoolyard fence alone with your
eyes closed as if no one was watching as if no one could
see you standing there sally what do you think about
when you dose your eyes like that and why do you always
have to go straight home after school you become a different
sally you pull your skirt straight you rub the blue
paint off your eyelids you dont laugh sally you look at
your feet and walk fast to the house you cant come out
from sally do you sometimes wish you didnt have to go
home do you wish your feet would one day keep walking
and take you far away from mango street far away and
maybe your feet would stop in front of a house a nice one
with flowers and big windows and steps for you to climb
up two by two upstairs to where a room is waiting for you
and if you opened the little window latch and gave it a
shove the windows would swing open all the sky would come in thered be no nosy neighbors watching no motorcycles
and cars no sheets and towels and laundry only
trees and more trees and plenty of blue sky and you could
laugh sally you could go to sleep and wake up and never
have to think who likes and doesnt like you you could
close your eyes and you wouldnt have to worry what people
said because you never belonged here anyway and nobody
could make you sad and nobody would think youre strange
because you like to dream and dream and no one could
yell at you if they saw you out in the dark leaning against
a car leaning against somebody without someone thinking
you are bad without somebody saying it is wrong without
the whole world waiting for you to make a mistake when
all you wanted all you wanted sally was to love and to
love and to love and ta love and no one could call that
crazy

minerva writes poems


minerva is only a little bit older than me but already
she has two kids and a husband who left her mother raised
her kids alone and it looks like her daughters will go that
way too minerva cries because her luck is unlucky every
night and every day and prays but when the kids are
asleep after shes fed them their pancake dinner she writes
poems on little pieces of paper that she folds over and over
and holds in her hands a long time little pieces of paper
that smell like a dime
she lets me read her poems i let her read mine she
is always sad like a house on firealways something wrong
she has many troubles but the big one is her husband who r
left and keeps leaving
one day she is through and lets him know enough is
enough out the door he goes clothes records shoes out
the window and the door locked but that night he comes
back and sends a big rock through the window then he
is sorry and she opens the door again same story
next week she comes over black and blue and asks ­
what can she do minerva i dont know which way shell ii
go there is nothing i can do



bums in the attic

i want a house on a hill like the ones with the gardens
where papa works we go on sundays papas day off i
used to go i dont anymore you dont like to go out with
us papa says getting too old getting too stuckup says
nenny i dont tell them i am ashamedall of us staring
out the window like the hungry i am tired of looking at
what we cant have when we win the lottery  mama
begins and then i stop listening
people who live on hills sleep so close to the stars they
forget those of us who live too much on earth they dont
look down at all except to be content to live on hills they have nothing to do with last weeks garbage or fear of rats
night comes nothing wakes them but the md
one day ill own my own house but i wont forget
who i am or where i came from passing bums will ask

because i know how it is to be without a house
some days after dinner guests and i will sit in froot
of a fire floorboards will squeak upstairs the attic grumble
rats theyll ask
bums ill say and ill be happy



beautiful  cruel

i am an ugly daughter i am the one nobody comes
for
nenny says she wont wait her whole life for a husband
to come and get her that minervas sister left her mothers
house by having a baby but she doesnt want to go that
way either she wants things all her own to pick and choose
nenny has pretty eyes and its easy to talk that way if you
are pretty
my mother says when i get older my dusty hair will
settle and my blouse will learn to stay clean but i have
decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their
necks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chainin the movies there is always one with red red lips  who is beautiful and cruel she is the one who drives the
men crazy and laughs them all away her power is her own
she will not give it away
i have begun my own quiet war simple sure i am
one who leaves the table like a man without putting back
the chair or picking up the plate


a smart cookie

i couldve been somebody you know my mother says
and sighs she has lived in this city her whole life she can
speak two languages she can sing an opera she knows
how to fix a tv but she doesnt know which subway train
to take to get downtown i hold her hand very tight while
we wait for the right train to arrive
she used to draw when she had time now she draws
with a needle and thread little knotted rosebuds tulips
made of silk thread someday she would like to go to the
ballet someday she would like to see a play shf borrows
opera records from the public library and sings with velvety
lungs powerful as morning glories today while cooking oatmeal she is madame butterfly
until she sighs and points the wooden spoon at me i
couldve been somebody you know esperanza you go to
school study hard that madame butterfly was a fool she
stirs the oatmeal look at my comadres she means izaura
whose husband left and yolanda whose husband is dead
got to take care all your own she says shaking her head
then out of nowhere
shame is a bad thing you know it keeps you down
you want to know why i quit school because i didnt have
nice clothes no clothes but i had brains
yup she says disgusted stirring again i was a smart
cookie then


what sally said

he never hits me hard she said her mama rubs lard on all the places where it hurts then at school shed say she fell thats where all the blue places come from thats why her skin is always scarred
but who believes her a girl that big a girl who comes
in with her pretty face all beaten and black cant be falling
off the stairs he never hits me hard but sally doesnt tell about that time he hit her with
his hands just like a dog she said like if i was an animal j
he thinks im going to run away like his sisters who made
the family ashamed just because im a daughter and then
she doesnt say sally was going to get permission to stay with us a little and one thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent and wouldve stayed too except when the dark came her father whose eyes were little from crying knocked on the door and said please come back this is the last time and she said daddy and went home
then we didnt need to worry until one day sallys
father catches her talking to a boy and the next day she
doesnt come to school and the next until the way sally
tells it he just went crazy he just forgot he was her father
between the buckle and the belt youre not my daughter youre not my daughter
and then he broke into his hands

the monkey garden

the monkey doesnt live there anymore the monkey
movedto kentuckyand took his people with him and
i was glad because i couldnt listen anymore to his wild
screaming at night the twangy yakketyyak of the people
who owned him the green metal cage the porcelain table
top the family that spoke like guitars monkey family
table all gone
and it was then we took over the garden we had been
afraid to go into when the monkey screamed and showed
its yellow teeth
there were sunflowers big as flowers on mars and
thick cockscombs bleeding the deep red fringe of theater
curtains there were dizzy bees and bowtied fruit flies
turning somersaults and humming in the air sweet sweet
peach trees thorn roses and thistle and pears weeds like
so many squintyeyed stars and brush that made your ankles
itch and itch until you washed with soap and water
there were big green apples hard as knees and everywhere
the sleepy smell of rotting wood damp earth and
dusty hollyhocks thick and perfumy like the blueblond
hair of the dead yellow spiders ran when we turned rocks over and
pale worms blind and afraid of light rolled over in their
sleep poke a stick in the sandy soil and a few blueskinned
beetles would appear an avenue of ants so many crusty
lady bugs this was a garden a wonderful thing to look at
in the	 spring but bit by bit after the monkey left the
garden began to take over itself flowers stopped obeying
the little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their
paths weeds mixed in dead cars appeared overnight like
mushrooms first one and then another and then a pale
blue pickup with the front windshield missing before you knew it the monkey garden became filled with sleepy cars
 things had a way of disappearing in the garden as
if the garden itself ate them or as if with its oldman
memory it put them away and forgot them nenny found
a dollar and a dead mouse between two rocks in the stone
wall where the morning glories climbed and once when
we were playing hideandseek eddie vargas laid his head
beneath a hibiscus tree and fell asleep there like a rip van
winkle until somebody remembered he was in the game
and went back to look for him
this i suppose was the reason why we went there
far away from where our mothers could find us we and
a few old dogs who lived inside the empty cars we made
a clubhouse once on the back of that old blue pickup and besides we liked to jump from the roof of one car to another
and pretend they were giant mushrooms
somebody started the lie that the monkey garden had
been there before anything we liked to think the garden
could hide things for a thousand years there beneath the
roots of soggy flowers were the bones of murdered pirates
and dinosaurs the eye of a unicorn turned to coal
this is where i wanted to die and where i tried one
day but not even the monkey garden would have me it
was the last day i would go there  who was it that said i was getting too old to play the
games who was it i didnt listen to i only remember that
when the others ran i wanted to run too up and down
and through the monkey garden fast as the boys not like
sally who screamed if she got her stockings muddy
i said sally come on but she wouldnt she stayed
by the curb talking to tito and his friends play with the
kids if you want she said im staying here she could be
stuckup like that if she wanted to so i just left
it was her own fault too when i got back sally was
pretending to be mad  something about the boys having
stolen her keys please give them back to me she said
punching the nearest one with a soft fist they were laughing
she was too it was a joke i didnt get
i wanted to go back with the other kids who were still
jumping on cars still chasing each other through the garden
but sally had her own game
one of the boys invented the rules one of titos
friends said you cant get the keys back unless you kiss us
and sally pretended to be mad at first but she said yes it
was that simple
i dont know why but something inside me wanted
to throw a stick something wanted to say no when i
watched sally going into the garden with titos buddies all  grinning it was just a kiss thats all a liss for each one so what she said
only how come i felt angry inside like something
wasnt right sally went behind that old blue pickup to usa
the boys and get her keys back and i ran up three flights
of stairs to where tito lived his mother was ironing shirts
she was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop bottle
and smoking a cigarette
your son and his friends stole sallys keys and now
they wont give them back unless she kisses them and right
now theyre making her kiss them i said all out of breath
from the three flights of stairs
those kids she said not looking up from her ironing
thats all
what do you want me to do she said call the cops
and kept on ironing
i looked at her a long time but couldnt think of
anything to say and ran back down the three flights to the
garden where sally needed to be saved i took three big
sticks and a brick and figured this was enough
but when i got there sally said go home those boys
said leave us alone i felt stupid with my brick they all
looked at me as if i was the one that was crazy and made
me feel ashamed
and then i dont know why but i had to run away i
had to hide myself at the other end of the garden in the
jungle part under a tree that wouldnt mind if i lay down
and cried a long time i closed my eyes like tight stars so
that i wouldnt but i did my face felt hot everything
inside hiccupped
i read somewhere in india there are priests who can
will their heart to stop beating i wanted to will my blood
to stop my heart to quit its pumping i wanted to be dead
to turn into the rain my eyes melt into the ground like two black snails i wished and wished i closed my eyes and
willed it but when i got up my dress was green and i had
a headache
i looked at my feet in their white socks and ugly round
shoes they seemed far away they didnt seem to be my
feet anymore and the garden that had been such a good
place to play didnt seem mine either



red clowns

sally you lied it wasnt what you said at all what he
did where he touched me i didnt want it sally the way
they said it the way its supposed to be all the storybooks
and movies why did you lie to me
i was waiting by the red clowns i was standing by the
tiltawhirl where you said and anyway i dont like carnivals
i went to be with you because you laugh on the tiltawhirl
you throw your head back and laugh i hold your
change wave count how many times you go by those
boys that look at you because youre pretty i like to be
with you sally youre my friend but that big boy where

sally sally a hundred times why didnt you hear me

linoleum roses

sally got married like we knew she would young and
not ready but married just the same she met a marshmallow
salesman at a school bazaar and she married him
in another state where its legal to get married before eighth
grade she has her husband and her house now her pillowcases
and her plates she says she is in love but i think
she did it to escape
sally says she likes being married because now she
gets to buy her own things when her husband gives her
money she is happy except sometimes her husband gets
angry and once he broke the door where his foot went
through though most days he is okay except he wont let
her talk on the telephone and he doesnt let her look out
the window and he doesnt like her friends so nobody
gets to visit her unless he is working
she sits at home because she is afraid to go outside without his permission she looks at all the things they own
the towels and the toaster the alarm clock and the drapes
she likes looking at the walls at how neatly their corners meet the linoleum roses on the floor the ceiling smooth
as wedding cake

the three sisters

they came with the wind that blows in august thin
as a spider web and barely noticed three who did not
seem to be related to anything but the moon one with
laughter like tin and one with eyes of a cat and one with
hands like porcelain the aunts the three sisters las comadres
they said
the baby died lucy and rachels sister one night a
dog cried and the next day a yellow bird flew in through
an open window before the week was over the babys fever
was worse then jesus came and took the baby with him
far away thats what their mother said
then the visitors came  in and out of the little
house it was hard to keep the floors clean anybody who
had ever wondered what color the walls were came and
came to look at that little thumb of a human in a box like
candy
i had never seen the dead before not for real not in
somebodys living room for people to kiss and bless themselves
and light a candle for not in a house it seemed
strange
they mustve known the sisters they had the power
and could sense what was what they said come here and
gave me a stick of gum they smelled like kleenex or the
inside of a satin handbag and then i didnt feel afraid
whats your name the cateyed one asked
esperanza i said
esperanza the old blueveined one repeated in a high thin voice esperanza  a good good name
my knees hurt the one with the funny laugh complained
tomorrow it will rain
yes tomorrow they said
how do you know i asked
we know
look at her hands cateyed said
and they turned them over and over as if they were
looking for something
shes special
yes shell go very far
yes yes hmmm
make a wish
a wish
yes make a wish what do you want
anything i said
well why not
i closed my eyes
did you wish already
yes i said
well thats all there is to it itll come true
how do you know i asked
we know we know
esperanza the one with marble hands called me aside esperanza she held my face with her blueveined
hands and looked and looked at me a long silence when
you leave you must remember always to come back she
said
what
when you leave you must remember to come back
for the others a circle understand you will always be
esperanza you will always be mango street you cant
erase what you know you cant forget who you are
then i didnt know what to say it was as if she could
read my mind as if she knew what i hadwished for and
i felt ashamed for having made such a selfish wish
you must remember to come back for the ones who
cannot leave as easily as you you will remember she asked
as if she was telling me yes yes i said a little confused
good she said rubbing my hands good thats all
you can go
i got up to join lucy and rachel who were already
outside waiting by the door wondering what i was doing
talking to three old ladies who smelled like cinnamon i
didnt understand everything they had told me i turned
around they smiled and waved in their smoky way
then i didnt see them not once or twice or ever
again

alicia  i talking on edna’s steps

i like alicia because once she gave me a little leather
purse with the word guadalajara stitched on it which
is home for alicia and one day she will go back there but
today she is listening to my sadness because i dont have a
house
you live right here 4006 mango alicia says and
points to the house i am ashamed of
no this isnt my house 1 say and shake my head as if
shaking could undo the year ive lived here i dont belong i dont ever want to come from here you have a home
alicia and one day youll go there to a town you remem­ber but me i never had a house not even a photograph  only one i dream of
no alicia says like it or not you are mango street
and one day youll come back too
not me not until somebody makes it beucr
whos going to do it the mayor
and the thought of the mayor coming to mango street makes me laugh out loud
whos going to do it not the mayor

a house of my own

not a rat not an apartment in back not a mans
house not a daddy·s a house all my own with my porch
and my pillow my pretty purple petunias my books and my stories my two shoes waiting beside the bed nobody
to shake a stick at nobodys garbage to pick up after
only a house quiet as snow a space for myself to go
clean as paper before the poem

mango says goodbye sometimes

i like to tell stories i tell them inside my head i tell them after the mailman says heres your mail heres your
mail he said
i make a story for my life for each step my brown
shoe takes i say and so she trudged up the wooden stairs
her sad brown shoes taking her to the house she never
liked
i like to tell stories i am going to tell you a story about
a girl who didnt want to belong
we didnt always live on mango street before that
we lived on loomis on the third floor and before that we
lived on keeler before keeler it was paulina but what i remember most is mango street sad red house the house
i belong but do not belong to
i put it down on paper and then the ghost does not
ache so much i write it down and mango says goodbye
sometimes she does not hold me with both arms she sets
me free
one day i will pack my bags of books and paper one
day i will say goodbye to mango i am too strong for her
to keep me here forever one day i will go away
friends and neighbors will say what happened to
that esperanza where did she go with all those books and
paper why did she march so far away
they will not know i have gone away to come back
for the ones i left behind for the ones who cannot out2embed"
