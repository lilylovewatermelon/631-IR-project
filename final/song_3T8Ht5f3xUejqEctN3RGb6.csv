you brace and hold it all inside
its more than you can stand
no one around even tries
tries to understand

chorus
dont turn away dont turn away
come out swinging
come out alone
theyre in your way theyre in your way
but as long as youre swinging
strong then youll get by

verse 2
your pacings wearing out a line
right beside your bed
the scene replays a million times
stuck inside your head
and though you stand in place
your mind escapes
read between the lies
smiles on your face
you fake like youre ok

chorus
dont turn away dont turn away
come out swinging
out on your own
theyre in your way theyre in your way
you may be stinging
but youll get by
dont turn away dont turn away
come out swinging
never alone again
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likepostchorus
the pain inside can guide your way

bridge
midnight no sleep
inside you scream to
no one hears you fall
daylight prove me today day
one more try

chorus
dont turn away dont turn away
come out swinging
come out alone
theyre in your way theyre in your way
you may be stinging
but youll get by
dont turn away dont turn away
come out swinging
never alone again

outro
pain inside leads you leads you through so youll get byembed"
