well youre just across the street
looks a mile to my feet
i want to go to you
funny how im nervous still
ive always been the easy kill
i guess i always will

chorus 1
could it be that everything goes round by chance
or only one way that it was always meant to be
you kill me you always know the perfect thing to say
hey hey hey hey
i know what i should do but i just cant walk away

verse 2
i can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
i wish id go to you
ill pick up put down the phone
like your favorite heatmiser song goes
its just like being alone

chorus 2
oh god please dont tell me this has been in vain
i need answers for what all the waiting ive done means
you kill me youve got some nerve but cant face your mistakes
hey hey hey hey
i know what i should do but i just cant turn away
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likebridge
so go on love
leave while theres still hope for escape
gotta take what you can these days
theres so much ahead and so much regret
i know what you want to say
i know it but cant help feeling differently
i loved you and i should have said it
but tell me just what has it ever meant

chorus 3
i cant help it baby this is who i am
sorry sorry but i cant just go turn off how i feel
you kill me you build me up but just to watch me break
hey hey hey hey
i know what i should do but i just cant walk awayembed"
