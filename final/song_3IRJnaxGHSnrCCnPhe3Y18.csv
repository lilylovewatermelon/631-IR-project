verse
i play the bullshit from the backseat champ
yeah im in the backseat still got the seat back
feet back stay from where the fake be at
niggas snitch for the shine where the patience at
nigga make his own brother face his back
give love then take it back
good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats
face the facts you cant change him
cant shoot it if you cant aim it
cant miss him if he kill you then you cant blame him
thats just how the dice roll when you cant fade em
get too deep up in that water and they cant save you
me i come out of that water like i was just bathin
and watch my step on the wet pavement yeah
im from the hood so i rep em where i cant take em
hollygrove hollygrove was his last statement
so nigga get that look off your face
and recognize you got a crook in the place
they call me weecrooked lettery im so high
i skeetskeet in any nigga dime like shes mine
streetsweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
leave you bloody with the cops to match
bullet holes in your speakers from the chopper blast
like haha ah
thats bullet holes in your sneakers got you hoppin back
it all stop when they hit you in your top and back
no cockin back silly motherfucker you aint heard bout this
the clips hang down to the dick
thats an automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy
guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
when i hit every piece of your visible body he leakin
mortimer is no longer leapin hes sleepin
while you pussy niggas is sleepin im thinkin
deep in thought the boy aint even winkin
bob marley got me stinkin
stackin figures im standing firm lifes a slinky
pipes is filled with crack cocaine
and the dope go inside of the veins
from where i came
though i bear a name only one can live with
coach they wont knock me off my pivot forget it
im sicker with it pick a city buy a condo
find a fine ho let some time go chill
what you know about a bongo having her mind go
over a convo about dough nothing
man the fourwheelers look so good on the sand
tee or tank top pocket fan
no pocketknife no handgun in sight
just that rattat tat tattatttattat boom
haha tonight i might just boost my feature price
cause to each his own and the lights is bright
and im feeling like mike at a tyson fight
im from cita house big mamas house
she told me to shoot you right after i knock you out
and he aint gettin up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot
hold up the beat might drop
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likeoutro
