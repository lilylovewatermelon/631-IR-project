verse 1 lil baby
under thirty made the forbes list im a walking script record me
this a 30 and a 40 switch make it hit fast as hell
bitch told me she pray for me told her pray for brodienem in the cell
i dont got no stylist marni shoes and pants im fresh as hell
yes i know what happened i aint no rat so i aint gon never tell
you can follow baby wont lead you wrong bro i aint gon never fail you
big was tryna show me the right way to go i was so rebellious
whatever they doin dont bother me bro im oh so careless
you the type of guy that want the i for rеal you all so selfish
im the type of guy rеady to die for this shit if it gon prevail us
i cant slip look at this shit ive built i know they tryna nail us
give her two or three thousand off the rip she said she want her nails done
cuban links on just because this shit really from the mud
we handled the business like gentlemen i cant rock with thugs
jeff can get ten ms if he needed it you know i rock with thug
all my niggas jack in the boxes playin we poppin up
part ii

verse 2 nardo wick
pop up with them switches on
pop up with that shit on
pop up like my granny grandma granny lot of chains on
i might pop up with your bitch later on ill send her home
i heard he heard i hit his bitch so he dont like to hear my songs
she said wick you made me sick how when im your medicine
aint gay dont go that way at all but i love that nigga benjamin
chop stick grrtbahbahbahbah keep that for the robber men
foreign fabric cars and hoes im the only thing american
i done stuffed a million in the duffle smurf dollars blue color
pull up big body barbus trucks the new hummers
told me i lay the pipe right im her new plumber
its hard to interact with people i come from the jungle
we some animals in designer clothes and jewelry
how we got the same cars they drove in fast and furious
why she ask me do i love her i said you cant be serious uh
coldhearted touch my chest and you gon burr
you might also likeverse 3 lil baby
super fast i hit the gas you hear her skrrrr
twentytwo five lil rico got him pure
i was standin on the block tryna get a rack to buy a buick
now im trim lamborghini boy i know you seen that urus
if i ever run into your bitch your love life gon be ruined
take a break but aint gon never gonna stop this shit to be continued
from a traphouse beatin down the doors to packin out the venue
when they catch him they gon eat him up i put him on the menu
put piranhas on yo ass three four hundred on your ass
get the switch she actin bad like your mama on your ass
my first deal was worth a couple mil i still was sellin bags
maggot bitches trying to tackle me im stiff armin they ass
google said my net worth five mil i got that shit in cash
everyday my life go up and up its hard for me to get mad
im established i might pop out cactus jack on like im travis
they act happy but as soon as you turn your back they try to stab you
i done manifested this shit as soon as i see it im gonna grab it
i act humble but you can go and check my numbers i aint average
i be hearin shit but you old washed up niggas i be laughin
you dont hear nothing bout my young niggas cause they know to put on a mask

outro lil baby
yeah pop out with a baddie with me
pop up with lil danem with me
pop up with that cannon on me
he cant come we banned lil homie5embed"
