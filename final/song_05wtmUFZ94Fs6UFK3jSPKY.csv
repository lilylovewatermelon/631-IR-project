i got a hard head i get that from my dad
and i can overreact maybe just a tad
i put up walls to show the world im tough
when i dont get my way i get difficult
but when it comes to loving me
baby you make it look so easy

youre my refuge from the road
a safe place to go
when im out here living on this ledge
and when im circling the drain
you keep my crazy sane
and quiet all the voices in my head

im probably wrong more than i say
and id point that out if you were that way
yeah im hard to love and even harder to live with
and i know theres days when you just want to up and quit
but when it comes to loving me
baby you make it look so easy
youre my compass when im lost
my anchor when i get tossed
and the right way when all i can do is wrong
sometimes i drink til i fall down
but your arms save me from the ground
and hold me til all the hurt is gone
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likei got a hard head i was born that way
and that makes me wrong more than i say
but i thank god you got a hard head too
i guess he must have known youd need that
to get us through
cause when it comes to loving me
baby you make it look so easy
yeah baby you make it look so easyembed"
