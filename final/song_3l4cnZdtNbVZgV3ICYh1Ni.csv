well she was born in the mornin late october san antone
aw shes every girl ive ever known

verse 1
well she was born in the mornin late october san antone
aw shes every girl ive ever known
she dont talk about religion she talks about the stones
oh shes every girl ive ever known
and her tongue is like the devil when she tries to concentrate
says she dont want marriage but she still believes in fate
and she stands her ground defiantly but cries when shes alone
oh shes every girl ive ever known

verse 2
now her voice it is a melody that sings just like a bird
oh shes every song ive ever heard
and her heartbeat is a rhythm that commands her every word
aw shes every song ive ever heard
she reflects the world in happiness and echoes all the pain
her smiles a world of sunrise and cries to make it rain
and she hides the truth discretely but youd have to take her word
aw shes every song ive ever heard

verse 3
shes a sober sunday kitchen conversation with my dad
aw shes every friend ive ever had
well we never failed to cut a trail whenever times were bad
oh shes every friend ive ever had
shes a flighty goodtime buddy in the corner of the bar
but shed fight the devil for ya just for being who ya are
and shes the last to cast a stone although shed love to leave you mad
aw shes every friend ive ever had
