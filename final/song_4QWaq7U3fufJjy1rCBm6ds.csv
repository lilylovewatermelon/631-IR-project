same old scenario
one guys young and one guys old
ones in love and sittin on go
and ones already walked that road
ones on year number 33
and one just bought that diamond ring
one says dad so howd you do it
the other just laughs and says there aint nothin to it

chorus
just try to quit smokin and reel back the drinkin
dont always tell her everything youre thinkin
and dance her when she needs dancin
you get up and go to work get up and go to church
crawl up in that bed right next to her and listen
instead of having all the answers
then he slapped him on the back and said
son you can do it there aint nothin to it

verse 2
therell be trouble along the way
words will fly and dishes break
the baby comes in and money goes out
you will learn to ride the ups and downs
youll wanna quit a million times
but if you hang on the years unwind
and when you get to see your blushing bride
turn beautiful at 35 or 45 or 55

youll be glad you quit smokin and reeled back the drinkin
didnt always tell her everything you were thinkin
and danced her when she needed dancin
you got up and went to work got up and went to church
crawled up in that bed right next to her and listened
instead of having all the answers
its only love and all of us go through it
and if i had to do it again you know id do it
there aint nothin to it
no there aint nothin to it1embed"
