i woke up this morning a little hungover
it hits different since i got older
still got this old chip on my shoulder
the stubborn side of me will never get sober

prechorus
try to numb my pain but the bullshit never works bullshit never works
i run from shame ill do anything to heal the hurt

chorus
i fucked up again
hide behind my sins
ive found everything but closure
learn to swallow pride
behind these hollow eyes
i dont see change getting closer
ill never get sober

verse 2
i deal with this pain dont ask me how
i just hide behind a mask of smiles
when im down and drunken bound i get as high as i can be
i dont like the person thats inside of me

prechorus
try to numb my pain but the bullshit never works bullshit never works
i run from shame ill do anything to heal the hurt

i fucked up again
hide behind my sins
ive found everything but closure
learn to swallow pride
behind these hollow eyes
i dont see change getting closer
i need to get sober
