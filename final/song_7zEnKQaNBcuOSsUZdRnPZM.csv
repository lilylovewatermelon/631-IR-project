sing us a song
of a love that once belonged
nightingale
tell me your tale
was your journey far too long

does it seem like im looking for an answer
to a question i cant ask
i dont know which way the feather falls
or if i should blow it to the left

nightingale
sing us a song
of a love that once belonged
nightingale
tell me your tale
was your journey far too long

all the voices that are spinnin around me
trying to tell me what to say
can i fly right behind you
and you can take me away
you can take me awaysee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
