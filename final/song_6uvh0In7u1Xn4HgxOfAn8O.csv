you were riding your bike to the sound of its no big deal
and youre trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
nothing bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
so you tie up your hair and you smile like its no big deal

chorus
you can let it go
you can throw a party full of everyone you know
and not invite your family cause they never showed you love
you dont have to be sorry for leavin and growin up mmm

verse 2
matilda you talk of the pain like its all alright
but i know that you feel like a piece of yous dead insidе
you showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
its none of my business but its just been on my mind

chorus
you can let it go
you can throw a party full of everyone you know
and not invite your family cause they never showed you love
you dont have to be sorry for leavin and growin up
you can see the world following the seasons
anywhere you go you dont need a reason
cause they never showed you love
you dont have to be sorry for doin it on your own
you might also likebridge
youre just in time make your tea and your toast
you framed all your posters and dyed your clothes ooh
you dont have to go
you dont have to go home
oh theres a long way to go
i dont believe that time will change your mind
in other words i know they wont hurt you anymore
as long as you can let them go

chorus
you can let it go
you can throw a party full of everyone you know
you can start a family who will always show you love
you dont have to be sorry for doin it on your own
you can let it go
you can throw a party full of everyone you know
you can start a family who will always show you love
you dont have to be sorry no53embed"
