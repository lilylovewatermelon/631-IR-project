okay i realize now that everything that i did was wrong
okay i realize now some things are better off said than done
okay i realize now that maybe im not ready for love
okay i realize now i finished us before we begununun

chorus
im done so done im done with all the games you play
im numb so numb im numb to all the pain you bring
im tryna figure this all out for myself
i dont need you or nobody else im done so done

verse
i think that its time for you to realize
that im not gon be here forever but i
wish that i was but you were the cause
for every lil feelin im feeling inside
sometimes i sit and i think about why
i even trusted you shit im surprised
im walkin away from you its about time
want you to walk out and walk out of my life
and you yeah you yeah you
you stay on my mind way more than i would like for you to
and you yeah you
the reason i cant find no love dont wanna find no one
