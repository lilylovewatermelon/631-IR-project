well reverend reverend please come quick
cause i got something to admit
i met a man out in the sticks of good ole miss
he drove a series 10 cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip

chorus
dont you know the devil wears a suit and tie
i saw him driving down the 61 in early july
white as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
i heard him howling as he passed me by

verse 2
and he said i know you i know you young man
i know you by the state of your hands
youre a sixstring picker just as i am
let me learn you somethin i know a few turns to make all the girls dance

chorus
dont you know the devil wears a suit and tie
i saw him driving down the 61 in early july
white as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
i heard him howling as he passed me by

verse 3
oh foolish foolish was i
damn my foolish eyes
cause that mans lessons had a price oh sweet price
my sweet soul everlasting a very own eternal light
see colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
dont you know that the devil wears a suit and tie
i saw him driving down the 61 in early july
white as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
i heard him howling as he passed me by

well the devil wears a suit and tie
i saw him driving down the 61 in early july
white as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
i heard him howling as he passed me by7embed"
