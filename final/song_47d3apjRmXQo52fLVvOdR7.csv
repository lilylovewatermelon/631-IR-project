ladies and gentlemen of the jury
we all lived through the 70s
the clothes the music the heartwarming
but rarely amusing ziggy cartoons
now later who are we to look at these two fine young men
and say you there i sit in judgment of you

verse 1 mf doom
for being a drunken lush and bad as hell
read the charge and thunk sunk in in a plush padded cell
tempurpedic craftmatic adjustable
go on try to stare at it its not that combustible
i accidentally spilled some kerosene
and dozed off with the l lit doped up on thorazine
matter of fact make mines a double
few could see the point like a line through the hubble
doom hit the eye in the sky with a pie
shrink said he thinks he believe he could fly
spread his wings and flap like a goose
hell show you how to do it if you help him get the straps loose
diagnosed as shell shocked from totin toast
and still could hear the bells rock doc another lodine dose
he claimed he couldnt take the racket
faked his own escape in a eightball straight jacket

ladies and gentlemen of the jury
this animal here this ursine fellow unclean
he rejected society and retreated
to a cave in the woods to plot his vile  nod
and it isnt true that at these times
he often descends into a delusional state
sometimes actually adopting another persons persona

verse 2 mf doom
i started punchin once i saw son lungin
he had me put on punishment for eating the last munchkin
so now they got me down here near the dungeon
nurses all arguin over whos to do the spongin
he requested time off for bugged behavior
and rhymed off of thug beats bumped by a neighbor
who spoke with his fist and kept a mirror with a thumbhole
cell twelve drumroll ode to a gum sole
a og like a captain thats retired
rappers is space cadets yappin be quiet
and thats an order ship your daughters to my quarters at once
and dont sip the tap water dunce
he is the super a stranger who talks to you
maybe even offer tech support and walk you through
villain man in the mask spit in the face
show him where to go inside a hand basket case
outro myron reducto harvey birdman mentok the mindtaker  mf doom
the defendants confession
uhh nothing further
mentok commands you to procede with your case
just since some people wear a mask
dont mean they did nothing automatically now wait a second
your honor id respectfully like to have a word with you in chambers
i request an immediate dismissal on the grounds
on grounds that your honor i
just as the mask some people wear a mask
dont mean that they did something4embed"
