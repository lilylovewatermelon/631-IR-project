hold on
you are still strong
love will soon come
just hold hold on

verse 1
oh what have i done yet again
have i not learned anything
i dont want to live in chaos
its like a ride that i want to get off
its hard to hold on to who i am
when im stumblin in the dark for a hand
i am so tired of battling with myself with no chance to win

chorus
hold on
let time be patient
you are still strong
let pain be gracious
love will soon come
just hold hold on

verse 2
i swear to god i am such a mess
the harder that i try i regress
im my own worst enemy
right now i truly hate bein me
every day feels like the road im on
might just open up and swallow me whole
how do i feel so mighty small
when im struggling to feel at all

sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get
just hold on just hold on
and the emptiness actually lets us forget
just hold on just hold on
sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret
just hold on just hold on just hold on just hold on

let pain be gracious
love will soon come baby
if you just hold on

outro
