whats the deal with my brain
why am i so obviously insane
in a perfect situation
i let love down the drain

theres the pitch slow and straight
all i have to do is swing and im a hero
but im a zero

hungry nights once again
now its getting unbelievable
cause i could not have it better
but i just cant get no play

from the girls all around
as they search the night for someone to hold onto
i just pass through

chorus
singing oh oh oh oh
singing oh oh oh oh

verse 2
get your hands off the girl
cant you see that she belongs to me
and i dont appreciate this
excess company
though i cant satisfy
all the needs she has and so she starts to wander
can you blame her

chorus
singing oh oh oh oh
singing oh oh oh oh

bridge
tell me theres a logic out there
leading me to better prepare
for the day that something really special might come

tell me theres some hope for me
i dont wanna be lonely
for the rest of my days on the earth oh
