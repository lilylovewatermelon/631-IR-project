in the lane snow is glistening
a beautiful sight
were happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland

gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song
as we stroll along
walking in a winter wonderland

in the meadow we can build a snowman
well pretend that he is parson brown
hell say are you married
well say no man
but you can do the job
when youre in town

later on well conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that weve made
walking in a winter wonderland

in the meadow we can build a snowman
well pretend that he is parson brown
hell say are you ready
well say no man
but you can do the job
when youre in town
you might also likelater on well conspire

walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
