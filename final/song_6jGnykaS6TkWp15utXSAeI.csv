come away with me in the night
come away with me
and i will write you a song

verse 2
come away with me on a bus
come away where they cant tempt us
with their lies

bridge
and i want to walk with you
on a cloudy day
in fields where the yellow grass grows kneehigh
so wont you try to come

verse 3
come away with me and well kiss
on a mountaintop
come away with me
and ill never stop loving you

instrumental interlude

outro
and i want to wake up with the rain
falling on a tin roof
while im safe there in your arms
so all i ask is for you
to come away with me in the night
