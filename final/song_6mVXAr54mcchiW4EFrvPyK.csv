i know shes grinning in there
crossed your heart and hoped to die
and still you broke that spirit that i bear

chorus
lay me down for a while
maybe you can tell me why
all my dreams are so defiled
and prove to me
youre something like human

lay me down in sheets of linen where she hides
i know im going nowhere
everything i hoped to be and feel

is in those lies youre telling somewhere
