he said i am the devil boy
come with me and well make many storms

but inside my heart theres a picture of a girl

some call love a curse some call love a thief
shes my home
and shes as much apart for this broken heart

drink from his soul but ill never give up you
ill taste the devils tears
drink from his soul but ill never give up you
