i dont see you laugh
you dont call me back
but you kiss me when youre drunk
i dont know your friends
dont know where youve been
why are you the one i want

chorus
dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay
dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay
dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me
i cant be alone with you
got me out on the edge every time you call
and i know it would kill me if i fall
i cant be alone with you

verse 2
please dont chain that door
i cant win this war
your bodys like a pill i shouldnt take

chorus
dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay
dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay
dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me
i cant be alone with you
got me out on the edge every time you call
and i know it would kill me if i fall
i cant be alone with you

chorus
