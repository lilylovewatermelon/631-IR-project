this goes out to all them hard workin americans out there
we got your back baby
lets kick this thing boys

verse 1
i put my 40 in plus overtime
i oughta be proud of this check of mine
i open it up and i be damn
i worked half a week for uncle sam
hes up there havin him a spendin spree
a big ole party and its all on me
but he got his now its my turn
to spend whats left of the money i earned
light it up and let it burn

chorus
work hard play harder
get loud go farther
than any country boys ever gone before
cut loose go crazy
ill see yall monday maybe
when im down to my last dollar
work hard play harder

verse 2
when the weekends over its off i go
back to the bottom of a deep dark hole
scratchin my way up to the light
neon shinin on a friday night
i make my livin and i live my life
