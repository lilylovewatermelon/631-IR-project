i dont ever wanna fall when im this high

verse 1 machine gun kelly
i wrote a letter to myself
in the form of a song i can play when the sun shines
i know better than to trust
anything that i say to myself when im this high

chorus machine gun kelly

verse 2 machine gun kelly
i just did an interview with my eyes closed motherfuckereyes closed
i just sparked a blunt it looked like pyro pyro
only comments i see are the bad ones yeah yeah
only playlists i like are the sad onеs
yeah i let the mеdicine in i know it dont help in the end
but i got depression again
i had a meeting at 7 i skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7 pm
i cut my hair off like britney
sprinkle dust like a pixie wiped my nose like its itchy
im tatted up i dont give a fuck yeah

when im this high when im this high
i just looked in the mirror who is this guy
its a full moon where the good shrooms
im too fuckin high sound like a good school
higher than jehovah highway to heaven you know

lean in my soda so ima need a shoulder
why you got yo nose up i smell like guns n roses
