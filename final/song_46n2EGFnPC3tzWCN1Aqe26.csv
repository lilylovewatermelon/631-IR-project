oh oh oh oh
oh ooh

verse 1 justin
when the visions around you
bring tears to your eyes
and all that surrounds you
are secrets and lies
ill be your strength
ill give you hope
keeping your faith when its gone
the one you should call
was standing there all along

chorus all  justin
and i will take you in my arms
and hold you right where you belong
til the day my life is through
this i promise you
this i promise you

verse 2 jc  all
ive loved you forever
in lifetimes before
and i promise you never
will you hurt anymore
i give you my word
i give you my heart give you my heart
this is a battle weve won
and with this vow
forever has now begun
