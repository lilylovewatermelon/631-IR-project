listen up people and ill teach ya
bout phineas and ferb and a backyard beach yeah

playin under the sun
and get in line get in line
cause the wet skis runnin

a backyard beach a backyard beach
nothings outta reach
we got the backyard beach
you can change in the broken hut
drink out of a coconut
three games for a token but the rest is free
you got skiin parasailin
surfin and aflailin

or else you cant see

got the backyard beach a backyard beach
nothings out of reach we got the backyard beach
got the backyard beach a backyard beach
