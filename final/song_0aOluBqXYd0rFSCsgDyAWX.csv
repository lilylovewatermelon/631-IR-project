my lovers got humour
shes the giggle at a funeral
knows everybodys disapproval
i shouldve worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
shes the last true mouthpiece
every sundays gettin more bleak
a fresh poison each week
we were born sick you heard them say it
my church offers no absolutes
she tells me worship in the bedroom
the only heaven ill be sent to
is when im alone with you
i was born sick but i love it
command me to be well

prechorus
a amen
amen amen

chorus
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeverse 2
if im a pagan of the good times
my lovers the sunlight
to keep the goddess on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole sea get somethin shiny
somethin meaty for the main course
thats a fine lookin high horse
what you got in the stable
weve a lot of starvin faithful
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

chorus
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life

bridge
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then i am human only then i am clean
prechorus
oh oh amen
amen amen

chorus
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life
take me to church
ill worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
ill tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh good god let me give you my life
