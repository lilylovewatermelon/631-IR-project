nice to see you
how you doing
did you know youre
really something
you make me feel things
i dont believe in
its all up in my heart
and all up in my spine those chills

verse vansire
i spose someday these roads will reach the sea
its safe to say theyre tailormade for replaying scenes
but im too pensive
to decide whats real
all cause you left me with a heart chockfull of chills

verse floor cry
in the morning sun
you and i are one
fingers through my hair
feel them everywhere
dont know what to think
am i still dreaming
youre so perfect baby were you made for me
you might also likechorus floor cry
nice to see you
how you doing
did you know youre
really something
you make me feel things
i dont believe in
its all up in my heart
and all up in my spine those chills

hope it works out
in the long run
i think about you and
then the months gone

ill raise the issue in
tangential love songs
its all up in my heart
and all up in my spine those chills

those chills
ah those chills3embed"
