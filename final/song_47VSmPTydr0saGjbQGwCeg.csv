hold on to something

verse 1 corey taylor
yeah i wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
i wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
wanna dig inside find a little bit of me
cause the line gets crossed when you dont come clean
my wormwood meets your pesticide
youll never get out cause you were never alive
i am infinite i am the infant finite
come a little closer and ill show you why

chorus corey taylor clown  chris fehn
no one is safe
noises noises people make noises
people make noises when theyre sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing
no one is safe
noises noises people make noises
people make noises when theyre sick
nothing to do except hold on to nothing

verse 2 corey taylor
oh how does it feel to be locked inside another dream
that never had a chance of being realized
what the fuck are you lookin at
ill tell you what youre lookin at
everyone you ever fucking laughed at
oh look in my eyes for the answers typical
i can feel it underneath like a miracle
everybody in the world needs more than
lies and consequences to power them
once again its me and no one else
i cant remember if there was a someone else
its not mine its not fair its outta my hands
and its shaking youll never take me

verse 3 corey taylor clown  chris fehn
hate hate aint enough to describe me
scream somewhere between screaming and crying
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be
why when do i get to know why
bitter bitter as the stink of when i try
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be
no
bridge corey taylor
pull your hands away im gone goodbye its so depressing
withering away take a look inside my soul is missing
all i have is dead so ill take you with me
i feel like im erased so kill me just in case
i feel like im erased so kill me just in case
so kill me just in case

outro corey taylor clown  chris fehn
covet everything around mes mine
sty cant see through the sties in my eyes
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be
down scratching and clawing all the way
stay you wont let me fucking stay
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be
live is there another way to live
die cause its the only way to die
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be come on
no no no
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be
im not supposed to be here
im not supposed to be19embed"
