when you gonna stop breaking my heart
i dont wanna be another one
paying for the things i never done
dont let go dont let go to my love

prechorus 1 edward maya
i hate to see you cry
my love is dying inside
i hate to see you cry
your smile is a beautiful lie

chorus 1 edward maya
i can fix all those lies
oh baby baby i run but im running to you
you wont see me cry im hiding inside
my heart is in pain but im smiling for you

verse 1 vika jigulina with edward maya
can i get to your soul can you get to my flow
can we promise we wont let go
all the things that i need all the things that you need
you can make it feel so real
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i touch your body i feel im losing control
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i see you baby i just dont wanna let go
