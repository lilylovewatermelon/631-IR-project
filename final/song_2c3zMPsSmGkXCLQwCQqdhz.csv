you can bury me with her
and if she die before me kill me and carry me with her
know if i die before her lil shorty dyin a widow
lets not walk down that road
forevers forever eternally attached to her soul oh
oh my god i thank god for her smile
she too fine im too wild
when i fall she taps out
lets get a house and settle down
lets have a child watch em run around
im at my alltime high now
youre my sunshine through lifes rainclouds
