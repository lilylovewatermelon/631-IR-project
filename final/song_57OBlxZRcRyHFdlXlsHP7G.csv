feeling unsure of my naked body
stand back watch it taking shape
wondering why i dont look like barbie
they say boys like girls with a tiny waist
now my mamas preaching to make sure im pure
but i never really cared bout this shit before
look around the room to whoever wants me

prechorus
got boys acting like they aint seen skin before
got sent home to change cause my skirt is too short

chorus
its my fault its my fault cause i put icing on top
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
thats my bad thats my bad no one told them not to grab
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

verse 2
gotta make sure that my legs are shiny
hot wax melting burn my skin
people all around me are watching closely
cause its how i look and not what i think

prechorus
mikeys eyes seem to be glued to her chest
so im stuffing my bra so that mine look the best
see melanie martinez liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likechorus
its my fault its my fault cause i put icing on top
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
thats my bad thats my bad no one told them not to grab
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

bridge
instead of making me feel bad for the body i got
just teach him to keep it in his pants and tell him to stop

chorus
sayin its my fault its my fault cause i put icing on top
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
thats my bad thats my bad no one told them not to grab
now the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake52embed"
