ooh dont walk away
walk away

verse 1
dont walk away
see i just cant find the right thing to say
i tried but all my pain gets in the way
tell me what i have to do so you’ll stay
should i get down on my knees and pray

chorus
how can i stop losing you
how can i begin to say
when there’s nothing left to do but walk away yeah

verse 2
i close my eyes
just to try and see you smile one more time
but its been so long now all i do is cry
can’t we find some love to take this away
cause the pain gets stronger every day

chorus
how can i begin again
how am i to understand
when there’s nothing left to do but walk away yeah
