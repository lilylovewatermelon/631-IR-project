verse 1 john gourley with zoe manville
hey man im cool to lean on but im not your property
see im crushing down these problems cutting pain with poverty
im just tryna catch a free ride from the temple to the tomb
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you
let me be your oneman army ill campaign for anarchy
i been slipping through the cracks like i was clothed in vaseline
let me be your little sunshine in all this gloom and doom
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you

chorus john gourley  zach carothers
crashing on chardonnay and adderall
driving headon into the wonderwall
everyday holidays when daddys gone
living life like were the only ones that know were famous

were all tryna catch a free ride from the temple to the tomb
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you
i could really really really use a rich rich friend like you
