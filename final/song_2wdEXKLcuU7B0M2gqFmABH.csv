look at this photograph
every time i do it makes me laugh
how did our eyes get so red
and what the hell is on joeys head
and this is where i grew up
i think the present owner fixed it up
i never knew we ever went without
the second floor is hard for sneaking out
and this is where i went to school
most of the time had better things to do
criminal record says i broke in twice
i mustve done it half a dozen times
i wonder if its too late
should i go back and try to graduate
lifes better now than it was back then
if i was them i wouldnt let me in

prechorus
oh oh oh
oh god i i

chorus
every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
goodbye

remember the old arcade
blew every dollar that we ever made
the cops hated us hangin out
they say somebody went and burned it down
we used to listen to the radio
and sing along with every song we know
we said someday wed find out how it feels
to sing to more than just the steering wheel
kims the first girl i kissed
i was so nervous that i nearly missed
shes had a couple of kids since then
i havent seen her since god knows when

prechorus
oh oh oh
oh god i i

chorus
every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
bridge
i miss that town
i miss their faces
you cant erase
you cant replace it
i miss it now
i cant believe it
so hard to stay
too hard to leave it
if i could relive those days
i know the one thing that would never change

chorus
every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
its hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye
