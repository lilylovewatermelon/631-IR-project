verse 1
my cherie amour lovely as a summer day
my cherie amour distant as the milky way
my cherie amour pretty little one that i adore
youre the only girl my heart beats for
how i wish that you were mine

verse 2
in a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
ive been near you but you never noticed me
my cherie amour wont you tell me how could you ignore
that behind that little smile i wore
how i wish that you were mine

chorus
lala la la la la
lala la la la la
lala la la la la
lala la la la la

verse 3
maybe someday youll see my face among the crowd
maybe someday ill share your little distant cloud
oh cherie amour pretty little one that i adore
youre the only girl my heart beats for
how i wish that you were mine
