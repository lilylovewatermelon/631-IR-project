theres a tear in the mud on the banks of the river
and the sound of a lovers goodbye
and a pain in my heart cause i could not forgive her
thats as deep as the river is wide
im lost and im lonesome when i look in the mirror
i dont like the man that i see
and the more that i look the more it gets clearer
pride made a fool out of me

chorus
so i drink all night
but the hurtin wont stop
and every shot i take just turns into teardrops
when i lay down to sleep
and i pray i dont open my eyes
to a whiskey sunrise

verse 2
the cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
and the rain will be comin on soon
and everythings wrong and nothin dont matter
and a black cloud is crossin the moon

chorus
so i drink all night
but the hurtin wont stop
and every shot i take just turns into teardrops
and i lay down to sleep
and i pray i dont open my eyes
to a whiskey sunrisesee chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also like2embed"
