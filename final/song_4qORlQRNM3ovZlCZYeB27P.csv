you can be right
and ill be real
oh and it still wont be a pain
that you will have to feel
because i dont need your approval
to find my worth
im trapped inside of my own mind
afraid to open my eyes because of what id find and i
dont want to live like this anymore

chorus 1
there goes my pain
there goes my chains
did you see them falling
because this feeling
there has no meaning

chorus 2
there goes the world
off of my shoulders
there goes the world
off of my back
there it goes

verse 2
does it scare you that i can
be something different than you
would it make you feel
more comfortable if i wasnt
well you cant control me
and you cant take away from me who i am

chorus 2x2

verse 3
have you ever felt
like your only comfort was your cage
youre not alone
ive felt the same as you
have you ever felt like your secrets give you away
youre not alone
ive been there too

bridge
because everyone is looking
everyone is laughing
but i think everyone feels the same
everybody wants to feel okay
everybody wants to
everybody wants to feel

chorus 2

bridge
because i dont want it
i dont want it
you cant change me
you cant break me
