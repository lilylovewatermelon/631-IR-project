im dreaming of one kiss from you
a love long and true
well go on and on and
hey oh yeah

verse 1
i dont wanna hear that im too young
to know its love that makes me feel this way
cause i dont have to feel the heat of the sun
to know its shining on me every day
when its warm outside
and the look in your eyes
is longing to show me the way no no
i dont want to wait

chorus
just one kiss from you and suddenly yeah
i see the road laid out in front of me
you give me strength you give me hope
and when you hold me in your arms you make me whole
and i dont know just what i would do
without one kiss from you

verse 2
i dont wanna hear my time will come
when it feels like its already here
we should learn to walk before we run
but why go anywhere when youre so near
cause when i reach out to you
so sad and confused
and feeling like i could cry
you dry my eyes

just one kiss from you and suddenly yeah

you give me strength you give me hope
and when you hold me in your arms you make me whole
and i dont know just what i would do
without one kiss from you
