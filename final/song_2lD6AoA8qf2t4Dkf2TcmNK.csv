chorus
got me breathing with dragons
ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
im marilyn manson with madness
now just imagine the magic i light to asses
dont ask for your favorite rapper
he dead yes sir amen church
he dead i killed him amen bitch

verse 1
and this is rigor mortis and its gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and im morpheus the matrix of my mind
im out the orbit you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
im on the toilet when i rhyme if you the shit then i decline
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud nine
and thats important when you morph into an angel in the sky
and dont be forging all my signatures my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style you got a hell of an appetite
and ima be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you can fight we always making em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi just might investigate this fucking parasite
he dead amen
thats what they telling me
aim it at your celebrity this is studio felony
ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70s
nigga paybacks a bitch and bitch you been livin in debt with me
dead em all and especially
leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling thats irrelevant rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody couldnt think of a better d
better be on your p and q its just me jay rock soul and q
solar system and barbecue nothing else you can do

verse 2
i wrapped him and made him casper i capture the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya ill pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners wont you send us to bible study faster
your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy i assassin my casualty
and its casually done and tell em my salary come
in lump sum one hundreds dont talk to me bout no money
the sun is under my feet and i come in peace to compete
i dont run if youd rather leap my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic anybody can see
any assistance everybody deceased
some persistence recognize i be
really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the street
better partition better dot your t
and i gon mention how the far you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitching getting mad at me
recognize kendrick in the battery
and im charged up and the catastrophe
is charged up and the audacity
of yall fucks never could hassle me
and yall luck just ran out youll see
chorus
he dead yupyup amen i know
he dead for sure amen amen
got me breathing with dragons
ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
