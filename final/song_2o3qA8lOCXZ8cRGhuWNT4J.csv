whoaohohoh

verse 1
can’t swim so i took a boat
to an island so remote
only johnny depp has ever been to it before
stayed there til the air was clear
i was bored and out of tears
then i saw you washed up on the shore
i offered you my coat
thank goddess love can float
crazy how that shipwreck meant my ship was coming in
we talked til the sun went down
love on the puget sound
my treasure map was on your skin

chorus
beauty in the water
angel on the beach
ocean’s daughter
i thought love was out of reach
til i got her
had i known it could come true
i would have wished in ’92
for a mermaid just like you
whoaohohohoh
just like you
whoaohohoh
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeverse 2
sharks green with envy
they wonder what you see in me
funny but sometimes can’t help but wonder that as well
now life is a holiday
making up for the years i paid
the way to this heavenly bay it went through hell

chorus
beauty in the water
angel on the beach
ocean’s daughter
i thought love was out of reach
til i got her
had i known it could come true
i would have wished in ’92
for a mermaid just like you
whoaohohohoh
just like you
whoaohohoh

bridge
rescued you by the banyan tree
all the girlfish in the sea
couldnt hold a candle to you they don’t have a handle on you
they don’t have a scandal on you i love ecco sandals on you
saving me was big
all the boyfish in the sea
they all wish that they could be me
breakdown
can’t swim so i took a boat
to an island so remote
only johnny depp has ever been to it before

chorus
beauty in the water
angel on the beach
ocean’s daughter
i thought love was out of reach
til i got her
had i known it could come true
i would have wished in ’92
for a mermaid just like you
whoaohohohoh
just like you
whoaohohoh
