verse 1
never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
took the image of a thug kept shit appealin
willin to stick out my neck for respect
if it meant life or death never live to regret what i said
when youre me people just wanna see if its true
if its you—what you say in your raps what you do
so they feel its part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation aint no conversation if you feel
youre in violation any hesitationll get you killed
if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
being reasonablell leave you full of bullets pull it
squeeze it til its empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

chorus
im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

i love pissin you off gets me off
like my lawyers when the fuckin judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
ill violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
im a lit fuse anything i do bitch its news
pistolwhippin motherfucking bouncers 62
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
its actually better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
its like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin out their halter tops
runnin and duckin out the hot rocks parking lot
youll all get shot whether its your fault or not cause im a—

verse 3
i spit it slow so these kids know that im talkin to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
im like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rockin to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
dont even try it youll look stupid do not pursue it
dont ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped in twoinch
so tickytock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that ill never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity im a—
