time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

aaron burr sir
burr
can we agree that duels are dumb and immature

hamilton
sure
but your man has to answer for his words burr

burr
with his life we both know that’s absurd sir

hamilton
hang on how many men died because lee was inexperienced and ruinous

burr
okay so we’re doin’ this

company

look ‘em in the eye aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then count
