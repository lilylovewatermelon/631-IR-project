you are my hurt locker lover
keep me walking on a wire
dont know when youll blow
so i tiptoe through your triggered mind
you fight me but im on your side
defeated now retreating

prechorus
why you tryna make me your enemy
all we really need is a little peace
i just wanna be your lover
oh this is not a competition
so baby why the ammunition
i dont wanna be the last one standing

chorus
choose your battles babe
then youll win the war
stop digging your own grave
when theres so much to live for
choose your battles babe
cause im not fighting anymore
i am not fighting anymore

verse 2
ive tried to pick off your red flags
while dancing on broken glass
your mind games hit like grenades
feel cursed just like the kennedys
but you somehow get me on my knees
defeated now retreating
