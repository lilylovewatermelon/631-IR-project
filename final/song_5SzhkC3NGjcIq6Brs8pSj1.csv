verse 1 ski mask the slump god
sons daughters wives lives all lost in the name that love that died
mary jane replacement for any bitch that kill my vibe
im hot as fuck like cast a spell
the village people couldnt even burn me alive
bad habits live fast die young fully aware of the power inside
dont really be going outside
got my own amenities on my side
you know that every club wont let me inside holup ayy
like pinocchio can never tell a lie
and yes i know cause when i look up in your eyes
déjà vu who is this they feelin every time
that look you give me every time im high
