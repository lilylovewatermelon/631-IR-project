this time im taking it away
ive got a problem
with me getting in the way
not by design
so i take my face
and bash it into a mirror
i wont have to see the pain
pain pain

prechorus
this state is elevating
as the hurt turns into hating
anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

chorus
the hurt inside is fading aahaahaah
this shits gone way too far
all this time ive been waiting
oh i cannot grieve anymore
for whats inside awaking aahaahaah
im not im not a whore
youve taken everything and aahaahaah
oh i cannot give any more

verse 2
my minds done with this okay
ive got a question
can i throw it all away
take back whats mine
so i take my time
guiding the blade down the line
each cut closer to the vein
