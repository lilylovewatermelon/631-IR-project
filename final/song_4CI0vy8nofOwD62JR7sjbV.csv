dont react when i tell you
and dont react when i tell you
that bright lights mean nothing to you
cause no one would know the sound of a ghost
and i might be something to you
beyond beautiful is the sound of a ghost

verse 2
can we lose our minds
and call it love for the last time yeah
my darling never rest until the darker gets
the best of all we had can the cold carry on
when the light means nothing to you
then no one would know the sound of a ghost
and i might be perfect with you
but no one would know so tell me tell me

bridge
have you ever really danced on the edge
is something still scaring you
have you ever really danced on the edge
the count of three is up
have you ever really danced on the edge
alright then tell me so
have you ever really danced on the edge
just hold my hand and jump
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeoutro
and bright lights mean nothing to you
cause no one would know the sound of a ghost
oh no one would know the sound of a ghost8embed"
