i apologized when i picked her up
said this old truck is just a fixer up
she smiled and said hey thats ok
just a couple letters missing from the chevrolet
i pulled out of her country club neighborhood
she was over there looking so damn good
and i was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks

chorus
but she took care of that when she pulled out that moon shine
tasted like an apple pie
we were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
sho nuff messing me up
till i couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
i never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
and that apple pie moonshine

verse 2
we were dancing around in the high beams
her hands in the back pockets of my jeans
the radio playing the perfect song
i still think about her every time the thing comes on
and i never forget that first kiss
when a country boy got to hold a real princess
i can still taste the cinnamon on her lips
every time i reminisce

its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
we were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
sho nuff messing me up
till i couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
i never felt so fine caught up in a good time
between her and that apple pie moonshine
yeah i couldnt tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
i never felt so fine
caught up in a good time between her and that apple pie moonshine
