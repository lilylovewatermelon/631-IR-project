ooh

verse 1
five drinks in on friday night
we only came to dry your eyes
and get you out of your room
and now this bar has closed its doors
i found my hand is holding yours
do you wanna go home so soon

prechorus
or maybe we should take a ride through the night
and sing along to every song thats on the radio
in the back of a taxi cab in brooklyn
oh no no the sun could rise
burnin all the street lamps out at 3am
so dj play it again

chorus
until the night turns into mornin youll be in my arms
well just keep drivin along the boulevard
and if i kissed you darlin please dont be alarmed
its just the start of everything if you want
a new love in new york

yesterday gave me a call stressing out about it all
said the world is moving too fast
and you dont know where to begin
cause youve spent a lifetime fittin in
only to wind up on the other side by yourself

prechorus
and every day screamin out
to all the people that you used to know
from a window that looks upon manhattan skyline
its just the way that life goes
and you hear it in every song you know
so dj play it again

chorus
until the night turns into mornin youll be in my arms
well just keep drivin along the boulevard
and if i kissed you darlin please dont be alarmed
its just the start of everything if you want
a new life in new york

bridge
and every song that plays is just like the day you had
and its okay to cry but im saying maybe thats a waste of water
you know im here for ya in the back of the taxi cab tonight
chorus
in new york its just reached the mornin and you still in my arms
and we stopped driving down the boulevard
and i just kissed you darlin i hope you werent alarmed
its just the start of everything that you want
a new love in new york4embed"
