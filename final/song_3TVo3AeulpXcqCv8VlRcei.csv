verse 1
i shouldnt say it but im starting to think i care
ive had a drink you probably think my judgement is impaired
and its getting late now were a long way from our homes
before you leave before you grieve
theres one thing you should know

chorus
when you hold me when you hold me in your arms
oh when you hold me yeah i can feel your heart
oh when you hold me when you hold me in your arms
oh when you hold me yeah i can feel your heart singing

verse 2
suddenly im standing on a treetop up so high
and all the songs and all the poems suddenly theyre right
and im dumbfounded by the breadth of your self control
but i dont care cause youre here and you and i both know

chorus
when you hold me when you hold me in your arms
oh when you hold me yeah youre bringing out the stars
when you hold me when you hold me in your arms
oh when you hold me yeah i can feel your heart beating
