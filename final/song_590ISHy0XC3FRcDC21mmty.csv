verse 1
still a youngin i run up them bands
shits all goin exactly as planned
see the diamonds up on me they dance
walk around with that gun in my pants
no my niggas aint throwin no hands
he said he was with it he saw me and ran
growin up i aint know how to scam
so juggin and robbin got me in a jam
i got niggas locked up in the can
most of them niggas that hate us they fans
on my neck thats a whole lotta grand
i soon go to cali cant wait til i land
on my mama i want this shit bad
so im in the studio gotta go ham
on my mama im doin the dash
i went through that once i cant do it again
one two three four five
dead niggas up in the sky
i be smokin on deadies
yall niggas aint ready for pressure we finna apply
sb niggas never gon lie
niggas want clout so i gotta move wise
ap is dancin i call it my prize
boy if you wouldnt stop tuckin your pride
if you want it im uppin the nine
fuck all this fame shit im bustin for mine

i wont let niggas fuck up my vibe
niggas really be fakin disguise

now its 2021 i aint wastin no time
same nigga aint a damn thing change
programmed not to say no names
i dont drink but i pop champagne
its for smelly and e and the sb gang
fuck boy you aint takin no chain
want clout you aint got no name
thirty clip let the whole thing bang
we some young wild niggas that just cant be tamed
red beam just to help my aim
big chop swear the five gon rain
they gon call me insane
brody died and i still never dropped no names
yall niggas aint got no pain
funny shit better watch your gang
whodve ever thought wed rock balmain
got a ap flooded i aint rockin no jane
rap money flip it like cocaine
new expenses i gotta maintain
niggas felt like i aint had no brain
til i got in the studio and everything changed
quick blow i ont gotta explain
im still tryna get used to this fame
pussy boy mustve thought its a game
this life aint for you better stay in your lane
chorus
how you my brother you tellin on niggas i dont understand
i done did hard time for the gang ill do it again
im tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
but nigga im with it dont ever forget it aint shakin no hands
how you my brother you tellin on niggas i dont understand
i done did hard time for the gang ill do it again
im tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
but nigga im with it dont ever forget it aint shakin no hands4embed"
