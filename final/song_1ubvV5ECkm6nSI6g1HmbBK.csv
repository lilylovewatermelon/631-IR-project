long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor wont fall through again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well i stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

chorus
dear john i see it all now that youre gone
dont you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shouldve known

verse 2
well maybe its me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe its you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and youll add my name to your long list of traitors
who dont understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
run as fast as you can

dear john i see it all now that youre gone
dont you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john i see it all now it was wrong
dont you think nineteens too young
to be played by your dark twisted games when i loved you so
i shouldve known

bridge
you are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so dont look now
im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
oh oh

chorus
dear john i see it all now that youre gone
dont you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that youre gone
dont you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you shouldve known
outro
you shouldve known
dont you think i was too young
