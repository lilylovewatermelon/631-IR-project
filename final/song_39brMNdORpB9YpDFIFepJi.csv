paulie killed tony right right
and tony killed ty so it was only right right
thinkin back twenty years they was homies tight
sixth grade for the love of the paper aint nothin nice uhuh
and paulie just aloving life
he got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
never used to party in them clubs every night
popping bottles blowing paper balling hard he know they hate it
but they gon respect it cause he rocked tony tony
and tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
and paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
and his young boys riding they ready to fall for him they ready
cause word on the street that paulie did that that
used key gold digging ass to get back back
text him through her phone found out where he live at yeah
she woke up in the morning like i never sent that
but she never told paulie what she saw
she was running her mouth fitting to start a war
cause tony little brother sixteen and up the wall
robbing everything moving and breaking every law law
and paulie on a rise now on a rise
niggas that played the middle pickin sides now pickin sides now
plus he heard tony brother tryna ride now
so he put a check up on his head he gotta die now i want this nigga dead
