i came here looking for another excuse
to run away from something beautiful
its like it’s driving me closer to you
every step back pulls me right back to you

prechorus nick jonas
time stands still and its only us
what we feel started way before we ever touched
just imagine only us
yeah you found me right before id given up

chorus joe jonas
i just saw the lightning strike
knew it right then when i looked in your eyes
and i said to myself it’s no surprise we aint strangers
strangers tonight
must be from a different life
been here before and it just feels right
no this aint the first time for you and i we aint strangers
strangers tonight

you say my name like its been on your lips
familiar in ways i cant explain

hold me like that and pull me right back again
