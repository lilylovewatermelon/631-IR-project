lets all stretch before we start jumping
warm up and get your legs pumping
well go from simple to fantastic
lets aim for olympic gymnastics
one two three four
now kick your legs high up off the floor
do just one more push ups pull ups
lets get down and do some situps too
just like mickey

wake up youll feel a little stronger
get on the road to making muscle
