shed do anything to sparkle in his eyes
she would suffer she would fight and compromise
shes been wishin up the stars that shine so bright
for answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

chorus
she must rinse
this all away
she cant hold him this way
she must rinse
this all away
she cant love him
this way

verse 2
how shed be soothed how shed be saved if he could see
she needs to be held in his arms to be freed
but everything happens for reasons that she will never understand
till she knows that the heart of a woman will never
be found in the arms of a man

chorus
she must rinse
this all away
she cant hold anybody this way
she must rinse
this all away
she cant love him

and as she runs away she fears she wont be followed
what could be worse than leaving something behind
and as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow
its loneliness she finds
if only he was mine
shed do anything to sparkle in his eyes
she would suffer she would fight and compromise
shes been wishin up the stars that shine so bright
for answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

chorus
she must rinse him
she must rinse him
she cant rinse him
she cant rinse him
she cant she wont she must rinse him
she cant she wont she must rinse him
she must rinse
this all away
she cant hold him this way
she must rinse
this all away
she cant love him
this wayembed"
