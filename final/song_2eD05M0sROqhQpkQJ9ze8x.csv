a means to an end but the ends dont seem to meet
walking around living the dream anytime i take the notion
til the truth comes bubbling up so bittersweet

aint no point getting outta bed if you aint living the dream
its like making a big old pot of coffee when you aint got no cream
i dont need to change my strings cause the dirt dont hurt the way i sing
i dont have to do a goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die
well ive been waiting on an angel waitress to come and take my order
tell me all about the special today
staring at a puddle of mud in my spoon couldnt be much boreder
hoping them circles on the paper dont call back telling me to start today
that old man upstairs he wears a crooked smile
staring down at the chaos he created
said son if you aint having fun just wait a little while
mommas gonna wash it all away
and she thinks mercys overrated

aint no point getting outta bed if you aint living the dream
like making a big old pot of coffee when you aint got no cream
i dont need to change my strings cause the dirt dont hurt the way i sing
i dont have to do a goddamn thing except sit around and wait to dieyou might also like4embed"
