murder murder murder dont be sad about it
nigga if you feel some type of way then go catch a body
my diamonds purple yellow and green like a bag of takis

verse 2
they can hate but they wont slide cause im the wrong nigga
if you fuck with my opps i cant do no song with you
i swear its too much on my mind to get along with you
im just a heartbreak kid like im shawn
i took the patek off my wrist and it gave me welts
i popped a perc and it was the last thing that i felt yeah yeah
i promise not to love you more than i love myself this time
i looked out for you more than i looked out for myself
if you a backstabber ima get you stabbed back
runnin your mouth around the town thatll get you whacked facts
and if you dumpin im still here nigga okay bet okay bet
ima do whatever it takes just to get you back
i dont need no stashbox in my whip no i cant do that
cause i just feel like its more safe with it on my lap yeah
my nigga please dont make me do this by myself
i swear to god if you got my back ima have your back yeah
voila
i aint lyin girl i treated you like nala
anytime you asked me to jump i said how high
and every time we go up we do it like zion zion
i used to be a savage bad bitch left her starvin
seen my best friend mama cry im so sorry
niggas starvin knowin they can never stop me
up in startlets hundred k to every bartender i was wildin
