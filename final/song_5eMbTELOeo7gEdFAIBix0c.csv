you know death right around the corner and prison my nextdoor neighbor
feel like im dyin’ to live
i know we live to die but i feel like im dyin to live

chorus
i be clutchin’ on my fire you never know these days
gamblin with your life you gettin close to the grave
sorry lord the devil got a hold of me lately
knew i shouldnt have never let you close to me baby
clutchin on my fire you never know these days
gamblin with your life you gettin close to the grave
sorry lord the devil got a hold of me lately
knew i shouldnt have never let you close to me baby

verse 1
i knew i shouldn’t have never showed you that i love you my nigga
i fucked up when i showed you that i trust you my nigga
i tried to turn my life around but now i’m back in the field
you know its free my nigga cool i hope he win the appeal
i lost my niggas it ain’t been the same
everybody say that i changed say i aint been the same
they dont even know im feelin’ pain
they dont know how i feel inside traumatized criminalized
but yet im idolized i swear to god sometimes i wonder why
it got me brainwashed lil ones off the same block
remember i had to slang rock remember i let them thangs pop
damn i just wanna raise my son wish it couldve been how it was
sometimes i wanna grab my gun
sometimes i dont be wanna hear none

verse 2
my boy got shot you put the blame on me
you say you know i did it
i cant even act like it aint faze me
that shit hurt my feelings
my cousin got hit up say he saw me jump out with the glizzy
why you had told them people you made me boy you know you didnt
i hit that lick in maryland i bought my mama a honda civic
the hardest thing i had to do in life was leave you
i was showin you love and had you feelin like i need you
im drinkin this alcohol right now i wanna see you
you made me go hard in this shit im motivated
why you had gave up on the kid when i was jaded
now ive been drinkin gettin faded
thinkin bout how you played me
thinkin bout how you did me

gamblin with your life you gettin close to the grave
sorry lord the devil got a hold of me lately
