pipe that shit up tnt
i just wanna be loved
dmac on the fuckin track
dont nobody understand me though
tahj money
the way i came in the game
the image that i had put out
they wouldnt expect me to have feelings
know it probably dont seem like it
thats why they talk about me like i aint human but we all is
but im still bein me
im still in the streets and im still thuggin until them niggas put me under yeah
thats how we livin and thats how we goin out you hear me open your mouth

verse 1
i say mama im so sorry
i got ice burned where my heart at
on the road where i had it hard at
how im chosen im so heartless so so heartless
i aint know my age he was sixteen they killed lil dave
mind in a rage im way too young to feel this pain
i aint know how to fade but i dove in cause im a man
i love that girl to death as we get old our feelings change
i pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
they keep on draggin me i play for keeps they scared of me
i cannot barely can barely sleep or even breathe
i cannot hold on without you on side of me
i never knew this fame would take the ones i love from way from me
i wanna see kacey bad but i cant seem to call nene
go in with no pen and pad i got this shit right on my sleeve
right now my candle burning wax im feelin like its burnin me

im just a lonely child
who wants someone to help him out oh oh ah ah

because my head been runnin wild wild

verse 2
i fell in love with kaylyn without even knowin this bitch done snaked me

before he go and i dont ride
chorus
im just a lonely child
who wants someone to help him out oh oh ah ah

im just a lonely child
who need someone to help him out oh oh ah ah
take this pain away my pain away
because my thoughts been runnin wild
