i bust the windows out your car
and no it didnt mend my broken heart
ill probably always have these ugly scars
but right now i dont care about that part
i bust the windows out your car
after i saw you laying next to her
i didnt wanna but i took my turn
im glad i did it cause you had to learn

chorus
i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how youd feel when you saw it
i didnt know that i had that much strength
but im glad you see what happens when
you see you cant just play with peoples feelings
tell them you love them and dont mean it
youll probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile ha ha ha ha ha

verse 2
i bust the windows out your car
you know i did it cause i left my mark
wrote my initials with a crowbar
and then i drove off into the dark
i bust the windows out your car ha
you should feel lucky that was all i did
after 5 whole years of this bullshit
gave you all of me and you played with it ooh woah
you might also likechorus
i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how youd feel when you saw it
i didnt know that i had that much strength
but im glad you see what happens when
you see you cant just play with peoples feelings
tell them you love them and dont mean it
you probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile

verse 3
i bust the windows out your car
but it dont compare to my broken heart ha
you could never feel how i felt that day
until it happens baby you dont know pain ooh

bridge
