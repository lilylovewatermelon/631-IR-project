from the moment that he looked at you and walked your way
until the second when you knew thered be no second date
maybe your heart felt fine it was your head that ached
but still you kissed him in the sprinklers but it felt like rain

chorus 1
but so what
i guess youll always be some lonely girl
and if you fall in love
youll still be living in this lonely world

verse 2
and from the moment when he said something and made you laugh
until he was kind enough to let you know that it wouldnt last
but still you laid there in his arms after youd swore youd leave
hair blowing from the ceiling fan but it felt like a breeze

chorus 2
but so what
i guess youll always be some lonely girl
and if you fall in love
youll still be living in this lonely world
but so what
i guess youll always be some lonely girl
and if you fall in love
youll still be living in this lonely worldyou might also like1embed"
