ooh hey yeah yeah oh yeah
you got to keep on keepin on
you got to keep your head up high
you gotta work with what youve got
and someday you will fly

verse 1
poor kids pouring cold water in their cereal
second hand clothes
surviving is pivotal
praying to god at night
that thingsll get better soon
i remember when i was in your position
tried to tell people my story
but no one would really listen
i know times are hard right now
happiness is hard to find right now

chorus
you got to keep on keepin on oh
you got to keep your head up high keep your head up high
you gotta work with what youve got oh
and someday you will fly ooh
you got to keep on keepin on keep on keepin on
you got to keep your head up high head up high
you gotta work with what youve got oh yeah
and someday you will fly

lookin out the window to a rose that grows in concrete
dreamin of the day when youll be standing on your own feet
hard to find the good in stuff that seems so bad seems so sad
seein other kids with their timbs on
fresh with air ones wish i had one
longing for a day when you get your chance to shine
dont worry therell come a time

chorus
you got to keep on keepin on
you got to keep your head up high
oh gotta keep your head up high

you got to keep your head up high oh
you gotta work with what youve got what youve got
and someday and someday you will fly

young girl sittin on the steps of her duplex duplex
why did god choose to make my life so complex oh
breathin to the beat of a slow sad drum
trouble is her only source of fun
i can almost guarantee you
