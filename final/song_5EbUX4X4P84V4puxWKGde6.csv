i got a little sentimental
the rental of your love
was all that you gave up
but i wanted it all i wanted it all

when we were doing the slow climb
the peak was a forgone conclusion
to lose it broke my heart i only got one part
but i wanted it all i wanted it all

when we were given a new chance
i got a little over zealous
jealous of your old girl
i wanted to be your whole world
i wanted it all
i wanted it all oh
i wanted it all
i wanted it all oohsee lake street dive liveget tickets as low as 41you might also like3embed"
