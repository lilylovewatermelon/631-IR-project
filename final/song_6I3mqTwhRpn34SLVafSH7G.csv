youngblood thinks theres always tomorrow
i miss your touch some nights when im hollow
i know you crossed a bridge that i cant follow
since the love that you left is all that i get i want you to know

chorus
that if i cant be close to you
ill settle for the ghost of you
i miss you more than life more than life
and if you cant be next to me
your memory is ecstasy
i miss you more than life
i miss you more than life
