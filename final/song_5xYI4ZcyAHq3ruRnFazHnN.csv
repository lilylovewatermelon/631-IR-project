well i heard they got married and they bought a little place
he worked nights and she worked days
and they had two mean kids
his old dog and her wandering eyes
well i heard she’s up to her old tricks again
she did what she did to me to him
and the whole town knew it
hell i guess i dodged a bullet

chorus
so if you find a dive down in cartersville georgia
there’s a dude with a bulldogs tattoo in the corner of the bar
with a scar on his left eye its from a mean right hook of mine
he got my girl and a few good licks in
it broke my heart but that was back then
and i figured out later well he might have did me a favor
so if you ever get that chance won’t you get that man a beer

verse 2
i can see him there and he’s sitting in the same ol stool
that i broke in when she broke me in two
and looking back now well i reckon i owe him a round

chorus
so if you find a dive down in cartersville georgia
there’s a dude with a bulldogs tattoo in the corner of the bar
with a scar on his left eye its from a mean right hook of mine
he got my girl and a few good licks in
it broke my heart but that was back then
and i figured out later well he might have did me a favor
so if you get that chance won’t you get that man a beer
