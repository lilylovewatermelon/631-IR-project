why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make
the very first scar
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart

verse
maybe i shouldve seen the signs
shouldve read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes
that i would be the one to fall

prechorus
no matter what you say
i still cant believe that you would walk away
it dont make sense to me but

chorus
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make
the very first scar
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart

chorus
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make
the very first scar
why would you wanna break—
why would you wanna break it

chorus
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make
the very first scar
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart
