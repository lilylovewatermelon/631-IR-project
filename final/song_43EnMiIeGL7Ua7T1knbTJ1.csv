false tales lies of a washed up prom queen
whyd you tell me everything was fine everything was okay

breakdown danny worsnop
get on your knees oh

verse 1 danny worsnop
oh why tear me up
no why everythings dead inside
oh you shouldve told me at least i wouldve known
no you shouldve told me and carved it in my bones

bridge danny worsnop
tear out my eyes remove my gift of sight
proves ever cursing the light wont find us here

verse 2 danny worsnop
painted red my eyes are burning
and still you hide behind the waves
your silence is haunting
your words relentless burying in
my heart betrays me for a last first kiss goodbye

prechorus danny worsnop
fall asleep
jar one eye
jar one eye

spilling every lie youve spilled before still im not forgiving you
whats happened between us what can i give to save us
being righteous isnt quite enough
whats happened between us what can i give to save me

postchorus ben bruce
these oceans are far between our hearts
the breathing has got too hard
these oceans are far between our hearts
the breathing has got too hard

outro danny worsnop
no
scream with the voice of an angel lie in the eyes of the gospel
smile in the face of your victims smile for me
this is my last request to you hold my breath
i was clutching onto disaster hold my breath3embed"
