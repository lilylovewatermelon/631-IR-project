standin at the edge of this cliff
gravity bein what it it is
im afraid that i might stumble
cause ive never been this high
and im so carried away by this place
and the simple beauty of your face
and the walls start to crumble
and im helpless to fight

chorus
cause you cant ask the sun not to shine
and no ones ever found a way to stop time
oh baby its unstoppable
i cant resist at all
and i would never try to slow down the wind
baby it just has to be what it is
and askin me not to love you
is like askin niagara not to fall

verse 2
i cant worry my heart with what if
oh maybe i should just give in
and wrap myself around you
and let you take me down
take me down

cause you cant ask the sun not to shine
and no ones ever found a way to stop time

i cant resist at all
and i would never try to slow down the wind
cause baby it just has to be what it is
and askin me not to love you
