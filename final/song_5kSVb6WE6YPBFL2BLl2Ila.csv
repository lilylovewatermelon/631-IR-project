vect
most of us have the constructs embedded in our minds to know that suicide is the wrong way out  completely selfish but some of us have fought pain for as long as we could  like all thingsyou get to the point where you just dont fucking care anymore deadly encryption sidroe aka vecteezy motherfucker bring it

chorus
vect
no more struggles with temptation
full of cravings of my annihilation
i suppose you think im crazy cause i have no fear
im done telling my story that falls on deaf ears

vect
whats gonna stop me from ending you when i wanna end myself too bitch
only thing i ever had in my cornеr to the end is all this fucking musick
im done waiting on thе ride to suicide
ive already died inside countless times
all this life gives is selfdestruction on my brain
it wont stay away  it knows im not afraid
got a 38 piece aimed to my forehead
taking turns at a table with a couple of my friends
pull the hammer back hear a click then a clack
somewhere in my mind i hear my daughter say daddy stop that
days pass by like a cold wind
with fatal selfinflicted incisions  my visions
its funny how youll give a shit when its all done
when you ignored all my letters  you didnt give a fuck

another day i wake up family in church
girlfriend left me so now my heart is hurt
shit is what i get for all of my hard work
might as well say fuck it  be 1 with the earth
i got some dark secrets you that never even cared
i can be on my lowest  you wouldnt be there
i know they wont miss me they would just forget it
like another pop single with the radio edit
so i write my last song  grab my dads glock
a 45 magnum  make sure that its cocked
before i get the chance on the door theres a knock
its a cop so now im doin months on the lock
therapy sessions  the suicide watch
i shoulda never answered it  died on the spot
now the pain grows to a thing that i fear
that when i look in mirror to see the devil is here

deadly encryption
every days the same another drug another slut
another cut on my wrist from my only lost love
was a bug to my stomach  a pain to my soul
so now i chill in graveyards hoping that i could just go
back to the past to the day we 1st met
so i could cut you from the neck  watch as you bled to death
so that way when the cops came im going for life
 last words she heard were will you be my wife
vect
im a zombie with a strong evolving mind state
im done trying to fight what has proved to be my fate
fuck tomorrow  fuck yesterday
look in my empty eyes death is now a game
my cause of death cannot be undone
i wanna die in the darkness  no longer feel the sun
i dont wanna be in the same world with my enemies
i am my own god  i choose to set myself freeembed"
