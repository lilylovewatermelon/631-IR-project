you think youre funny right
callin me drunk when its too late at night
telling me truths that you know all are lies
yeah you think youre funny right what
you think youre super sly
flirtin with them but telling me youre mine
buildin me up but buttercup you lied
now im gonna ruin your life

chorus
cause ive gotten tired of the games that you play
when you tell me you love me then you throw me away
so cry me a river til you drown in the lake
cause you may think youre winning but checkmate
yeah you may think youre winning but checkmate

verse 2
now this is getting fun
i saw you kissing someone elses tongue
you said that im the only one you love
baby this is getting fun
ill let you think you won
date in the park ill play it super dumb
holding your hand but in the other one
im holding a loaded gun
yeah baby you should really run

cause ive gotten tired of the games that you play
when you tell me you love me then you throw me away
so cry me a river til you drown in the lake
cause you may think youre winning but checkmate
yeah you may think youre winning but check—

bridge
and ima get you gone
cant play me like your pawn
set fire to your lawn
just like you did to my heart
and ima wreck your car and ima wreck your car
and max your credit cards and max your credit cards
a lover on the large a lover on the large
youre gonna wish you never harmed me

chorus
cause ive gotten tired of the games that you play
when you tell me you love me then you throw me away
so cry me a river til you drown in the lake
cause you may think youre winning but checkmate
and you did some damage so im making you pay
and no ones ever gonna love you anyways
cause youre just a narcissist whos totally fake
yeah you may think youre winning this heartbreak
but you arent gonna win it cause checkmate27embed"
