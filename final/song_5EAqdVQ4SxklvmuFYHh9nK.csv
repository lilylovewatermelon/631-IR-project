saturday i love you like gold
not like the monday
you pass like a ghost
the fire killed you like a motherless child
i saw you last sunday at barbara hotel
babe im so sorry ive nowhere to go

verse 1
could scream like a pig
could bark like a dog
just to get attention
as im chasing you down the hall
oh  maybellene youve been so lonely
got a fire burning
as im smoking you out again
still all the leaves will keep on falling
until i see you dancing
on the table fortyfive again

chorus 1
see you dancing for the young wolves
maybellene i hofteholder
could you be the only one
well i beg you to come home
dance forever my only one
you might also likeverse 2
could scream like a pig
could bark like a dog
just to get attention
as im chasing you down the hall
oh maybellene youve been so lonely
got a fire burning
as im smoking you out again

chorus 2
see you dancing for the young wolves
maybellene i hofteholder
see you dancing for the young wolves
maybellene i hofteholder
could you be the only one
well i beg you to come home
dance forever my only one

outro
i flicked the switch at monday night
maybellene im so sorry
that i didnt see it coming
and now the sky i filled with prayers
oh baby im sorry i was blindembed"
