i wonder why but then i realize the pain that she had
deep on the inside something you cant understand
i gotta take her back and now shes holdin my hand
im like a man with just one dollar gotta give it away
unless im all upon the mic i aint got nothing to say
im just a young man tryin to make one more day
to all them bad boyz no they dont mess with me
cause we used to have a drummer the boy he was a bummer
we gonna take a drum machine on tour with us this summer
people come along and they get smacked back and then the 0070
when i look into your eyes i realize love passes by
now i know its time to walk away they killin me deep inside
i said the people upon the world they have to see
that all this fussin and fightin no its not for me
yes im just a man upon the microphone stand
who hopes to give you some good lovin through the night
but if you got a problem then me dont understand
the only reason that youre comin around and claimin the man
to be the one who whos tearin your heart up in two
and then come rockin upon the microphone while givin it to you
when i look into your eyes i realize love passes by
now i know its time to walk away
youre sittin back on the couch tryin to ease the pain
cause it feels like the world is sittin up on your brain
insanity is creepin it comin up on you
you dont know what to do because nobody can help you
you got the feelin that nobody can hear you
see you or feel you or even get near you
the invisible man he does the best that he can
to survive in world where nobody understands
and then im sick of all the pressure and insanity
that seems to come without warning its always after me
im trying to live my life and do what is right
but if you test me boy blow you up like dynamite
they killin me deep insideyou might also likeembed"
