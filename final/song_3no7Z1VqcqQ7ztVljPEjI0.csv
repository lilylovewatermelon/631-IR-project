think youre in control until youre not
and youre so in love until youre not
find a place where we can be alone
find a place where we can be ourselves
so aim high and aim true

chorus
oh oh oh oh ah

oh im falling

verse 2
like a feather falling past your cheek
feel the breath of heaven on your face
we all die trying to get it right
were all gonna die trying to get it right
so aim high and aim true

chorus
oh oh oh oh ah
oh oh oh oh ah
oh im falling
