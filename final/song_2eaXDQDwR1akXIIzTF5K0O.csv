my sisters and brothers be thankful
they tell me the time has come for us
to give our souls to the cause
you will feel it shortly
let the hell energy wash over you
youll be elevated to something more
we will join them walk alongside them
help them forge a new world
it is our reward
our fate
we have earned thisyou might also likeembed"
