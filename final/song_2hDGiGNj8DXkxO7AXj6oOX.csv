another jake brake wakes me up to a hotel lobby coffee cup
that dirty old white pickup truck
with the trailer hooked up by the dennys shes mine
last nights bugs on the windshield
fast food trash on the dash meal
speedin ticket and a doctor bill
from a gash i got from a short go in casper
summer of last year maybe next year

chorus
and i ride and i fall
one day i might win em all
just some broken hearts and broken bones
and a hell of a whole lot of bein alone
but i ride and i roam
where i hang my hat is home
this cowboy life might kill me
but its the only one i know

verse 2
cell phone was breakin up
the night she called to say shed had enough
of my little white lies and little white lines
and wantin somebody who could never be with her
i look back on every fork in the road
that i took to chase that buckle of gold
and wonder if what i held for what i hold is worth tradin away
hell i dont know all i know
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
is i ride and i fall
one day i might win em all
just some broken hearts and broken bones
and a hell of a whole lot of bein alone
but i ride and i roam
where i hang my hat is home
this cowboy life might kill me
but its the only one i know

bridge
yeah itll kill me before it ever lets me go
itll kill me but its the only life i know
and id rather die than be caught cryin
so im just smilin wear my hat down low
wear my hat down low

chorus
and i ride and i fall
one day i might win em all
just some broken hearts and broken bones
and a hell of a whole lot of bein alone
but i ride and i roam
where i hang my hat is home
this cowboy life might kill me
but its the only one i know
yeah this cowboy life might kill me
but its the only one i knowembed"
