verse 1
clarity
figure all this out i aint gonna take a charity
marry me
wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
perfect
i know i love you i aint tryna let those words slip
pure bliss
i knew that we would stay together we in cursive

refrain
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala

verse 2
infatuation
when every single move you make is fascinatin
gravitatin
towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
activist love activist
sendin my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
hope you found what you lookin for
i hope you find what you lookin for
you might also likechorus
you take away the pain and i thank you for that
if i ever get the chance bet im payin you back
ima be waitin for that
ima be waitin for that

verse 3
misery
you represent love you the epitome
so wish for me
ill come out of nowhere—your epiphany
disconnect
from everybody who dont understand my vision yet
in a jet
is where my mind is so i light another cigarette to calm me down

refrain
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalala

verse 4
so calm me down
everybody who can save me now is not around
chopper down
busy today but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds
in between
purgatory aint as bad as it would seem to be
live a dream
thats so cliché but i can tell you what it means to me
chorus
you take away the pain and i thank you for that
if i ever get the chance bet im payin you back
ima be waitin for that
said ima be waitin for that
waitin for that

outro
