in the blink of an eye
i was falling from the sky
in the blur
you took my breath away

prechorus 1
and my heart starts beating
and my lungs start breathing
and the voice in my head starts screaming
im alive

chorus
youre like a laserlight
burning down
burning down on me
youre like a laserlight
burning down
burning down on me
you make me feel good
you make me feel safe
you make me feel like i could live another day
you make me feel good
you make me feel safe
you know i wouldnt have it any other way

verse 2
you and me face to face
and theres so much i could say
on these words
and forever seem the silence

prechorus 2
can you hear that box brebreabreaking
and the world starts shashashaking
they keep talking talking talking
but were walking walking to the light
tonight tonight

chorus
youre like a laserlight
burning down
burning down on me
youre like a laserlight
burning down
burning down on me
you make me feel good
you make me feel safe
you make me feel like i could live another day
you make me feel good
you make me feel safe
you know i wouldnt have it any other way
have it any other way
