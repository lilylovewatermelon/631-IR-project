okay but uh are you sure with my accent
i just want to be alone with you
is that fine

sexual healing
oh what a feeling

young and impatient for sweet sensations yeah yeah yeah
hey you know baby yeah you know
im still up to something criminal
stealing your peace of mind
girl let me know

i was seeing just one more time
i know you know its mine
oh yeah baby

verse 2
but where were you when i need you when i need you
when can i find you when im too low
i cant let go
girl confess that you were lost confess that you were lost
youre looking to be found youre looking to be found
youre searching to be seen just searched to be seen
youre anxious to believe youre anxious to believe
my love is natural my love is natural
itll find you wherever you are itll find you wherever you are
youre still number one to me youre still number one to me
