like any other would be country singing sensation
i had no visible means of transportation
one saturday morning i was searching the ads
when i found one that i wanted and i wanted it bad
he found one that he wanted and he wanted it bad
i called up the salesmen he said cmon in
ive got the lincoln right here belonged to loretta lynn
the coal miners daughter used to drive it to town
its yours for a song and five hundred down
he said its yours for a song and five hundred down

chorus
i said loretta lynns lincoln
yeah loretta lynns lincoln
i had no idea what that dealer was thinking
but he totted the note on loretta lynns lincoln

verse 2
well i throwed my old guitar in that big back seat
and i steared her on out on to dameron street
them other cars pulled over like the red sea had parted
it was then i had a vision of dolly parton
right there he had a vision of dolly parton

chorus

dolly said slide over j otis let me take you downtown
miss lorettas waiting for us at the orchid lounge
i couldnt believe my ears i couldnt believe my eyes
why she was waving from the curb and we drove by
well we turned that big rig around right on a dime
i aint seen nothin like that since red solvine red solvine
thats what loretta was saying as she hopped in the back
then she said hey hoss aint this my old cadillac
no mame miss loretta this aint your cadillac

chorus

verse 4
i heard a tapping on the window as i woke up
neath an old newspaper in my pickup truck
the policeman said boy you better hit the road jack
get that bucket of bolts back across the tracks

and he said son that aint loretta lynns lincoln
yeah i was waking up and my dreams were sinkin
like them ol springs on loretta lynns lincoln
