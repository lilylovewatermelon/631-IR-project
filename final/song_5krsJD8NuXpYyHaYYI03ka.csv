im a leaf on the river
fallen from the tall oak tree
drifting down this moving stream
wherever this life carries me
im a tumbleweed
in the desert wind
just tumblin while
the suns shinin
i have no boundaries
call me a gypsy

chorus
im restless
just ramblin
what do you do where do you go
when nowhere feels like home
im restless

verse 3
am i an angel fallen from heavens grace
oh it feels like that some days and i cant find my place
i guess god just made some of us
to live and die by highway dust
guess i just have to trust
on the days im crawlin
this is my callin

outro
oh to hold somebody close that cares
oh to finally find some roots somewhere
i know someday ill find that its out there
but until then ill just keep movin
what do you do where do you go
when nowhere feels like home
im restlessembed"
