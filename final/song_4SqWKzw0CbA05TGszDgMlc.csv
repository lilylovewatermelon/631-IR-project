i just need someone in my life to give it structure
to handle all the selfish ways id spend my time without her
youre everything i want but i cant deal with all your lovers
youre saying im the one but its your actions that speak louder
giving me love when you are down and need another
ive got to get away and let you go ive got to get over

chorus
but i love you so oohoohooh
i love you so oohoohooh
i love you so oohoohooh
i love you so

verse 2
im gonna pack my things and leave you behind
this feelings old and i know that ive made up my mind
i hope you feel what i felt when you shattered my soul
cause you were cruel and im a fool so please let me go

chorus
but i love you so please let me go
i love you so please let me go
i love you so please let me go
i love you so
