gold encrusted chandeliers
an elastic heart like i’m sia

keeya keys to her heart like
she’s acting ruud but i still wanna pree her
cause everybody knows i homeskool

chorus

i got the keys to her heart like keeya
that’s my bebey shoutout my right hand mia
she’s acting ruud but i still wanna pree her

i got gold encrusted chandeliers
an elastic heart like i’m sia
just got word from toliver but what did he say
mate trust me i got no idea

verse 1  yef
ooh when she gets down low
the way she vibe she got me thinking how so
she hitting that head shoulders knees and toes
a discord ting like i’m zho
you might also likecause this my throne bring the crown
you can drip or you drown
more time if you’re deya im local
i could be the class clown
turn a frown upside down
but everybody knows i homeschool

chorus
wagwan come here
i got the keys to her heart like keeya
that’s my bebey shoutout my right hand mia
she’s acting ruud but i still wanna pree her

i got gold encrusted chandeliers
an elastic heart like i’m sia
just got word from toliver but what did he say
mate trust me i got no idea
yef did you make this

verse 2  hex
aye wagwan
pass me the bands
i don’t wanna  cause i know she a fan
posh boy didn’t come from islands
but i fit on the beat like i’m from legoland
legoland my man i switch on the beat
prod by homeskool not tariq
if you cross the line then you’ll find it peak
nursery rhymes but you know its still heat
yef
bet who’s that one tryna flex me
she told me that i’m sexy
saw the six figure check
the sweet life on deck
then i told her next please
like wagwan brodie
twinsane like zack and cody
no disney but i switch my life like i’m hannah
surname montana
spray them like tony

hex
like hold on
i like you too like bono
why don’t you two come on over
minaj with me like nicki
no i’m not picky
she singing like ricky
this that uk us
h e x with the y e f
slaying the game someone call the ref
that’s the verse send it to yef

bridge  yef and hex
slide in a dm
moving like kante whipping in a bm
opps cant see em
what you tryna say we working by day
making money by the pm
i’m laying back living lavish
1 2 reverse it like savage
one compliment i’m established
rap debut ahile i did damage

chorus
wagwan come here
i got the keys to her heart like keeya
that’s my bebey shoutout my right hand mia
she’s acting ruud but i still wanna pree her

i got gold encrusted chandeliers
an elastic heart like i’m sia
just got word from toliver but what did he say
mate trust me i got no idea
yef did you make this1embed"
