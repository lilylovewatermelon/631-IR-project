once as my heart remembers
all the stars were fallen embers
once when night seemed forever
i was with you

verse 2
once in the care of morning
in the air was all belonging
once when that day was dawning
i was with you

how far we are from morning
how far we are
and the stars shining through the darkness
falling in the air

once as the night was leaving
into us our dreams were weaving
once all dreams were worth keeping
i was with you

once when our hearts were singing
i was with youyou might also like1embed"
