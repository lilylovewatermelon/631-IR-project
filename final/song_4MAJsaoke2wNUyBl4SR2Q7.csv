straight up out of control
full of words of wisdom
seein double vision
from a dead on head on
crash course in collision
a sucker for a kind word
from every voice ive heard
this is my laso for you

there you go again bein beautiful you
setting fire to all you hold on to
theres a place in my head portraying
one side of you
im letting go again
wont be another friend
to a beautiful beautiful you

im a concept in the human race
a mere burnt image
another shade of grays
provoked by pride
barely holdin on to life
a prejudice lover always in forever
cause this is my answer for you
you might also likethere you go again bein beautiful you
setting fire to all you hold on to
theres a place in my head portraying
one side of you
im letting go again
wont be another friend
to a beautiful beautiful you

i keep hearing what you said
it keeps playing over and over again

there you go again bein beautiful you
setting fire to all you hold on to
theres a place in my head portraying
one side of you
im letting go again
wont be another friend
to a beautiful beautiful beautiful youembed"
