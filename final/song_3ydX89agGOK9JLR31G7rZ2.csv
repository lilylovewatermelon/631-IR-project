verse 1 jayz
why is you over here lookin at me
while all these girls up in here
what you gay nigga jay straight like indian hair
yall dont want me to spray the semi in here
i mean if you a fan i consider you fam
but shake a nigga hand well shit god damn
all that do you remember me dawg nah im drawin a blank
you got me feelin like a fish in a fish tank
just think if you came to a club
tryin to find a little hon for some onenight love
stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
you make me uncomfortable thug go thattaway
and kill the ice grill holmes
cause i keep enough heat to melt that away
i came in some sweats i came to get met
tryin to find a chick that make it hard for me to next
we exit stage left hop in her lexus
treat me like a baby mouth on her breastes
may i suggest that its
a lot of longlegged chicks in shortass dresses
go find you one
go get your dance on go grind on one damn
go find you one
go get your dance on go grind on one

i understand all that but now aint the time
i came to the club to get that off my mind
and all you thugs with your war stories startin to bore me

and you keep talkin over the beat like clue do you remember
