she never been on a flight
she never been in a limousine
and now shes living the life
popping bottles in italy
shes dancing up on the table
got everybodys attention in here
she put my hands on her body
and then she whispers in my ear

chorus eva simmons
this is the best night of my life
and i wish this between you and i
can last forever
lets make it last forever
lets make it last forever
lets make it last forever
lets make it last for

i hope this aint a dream
this better not be no dream

verse 3 goonrock
you never know how its gonna go
when you bring a chick up in the limousine
seeing things shes never seen
and you walk up in the club straight holding her hand like youre the man
but deep in your heart you know shes a fan
cause shes struck by the stars
and the stars find her striking
you try to play it off cause you see a sign of frightening
william is spitting at her
tpains winking at her
ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys getting at her

whats the matter oh nothing
i reply straight but fronting wrapped in bottles started chucking
she grabbed my hand pulled me to the dancefloor
we dance close and then she put my hands low

oh i know where this is gonna go
ive seen it in a dream before
i love it when you hold me tight
and then we kiss til the morning light

prechorus eva simmons
this is the best night of my life
and i wish this between you and i
can last forever
chorus eva simmons
lets make it last forever
lets make it last forever
lets make it last forever
lets make it last for1embed"
