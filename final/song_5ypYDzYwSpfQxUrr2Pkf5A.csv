verse
you wanted the worst

hey its the bald man and im here to tell you why the new limp bizkit album is so important
thats because cds like this one spare you from all the charttopping teenyboppin disposable happy horseshit that brings up the bile from the back of my neck
i have no time or tolerance for old shitty wack acts like that
i wouldnt piss on their cds to put out a fire
and im tired of all those lameass tameass
prefabricated sorry excuses for singers and musicians
who dont even write their own songs
what the world needs now is a musical revolution
we need some rock we need something that has balls
we need something with substance depth something with soul some edge some passion some power
shit if its gonna be mellow fuck man
it better have something it better mean something
im telling you you gotta hit em with something hard
you gotta stick em with something limp like limp bizkit
im so fucking tired with that shit that im hearing on the radio
radio sucks
the same fuckin songs over and over again
all the weak ones all that disposable crap that isnt gonna matter in 3 months its just shit its crap fred
fred im telling you theres nothing but shit goin on and we need some new music
wwha what about limp bizkit
limp bizkit is fuckin cool you guys are cool the new records great
but fuck all that other shit im so sick of all that weak shit thats takin up space on the charts
fuck that shit fred im outta here
fuck dude fuckin pinfield is pissed
oh man i gotta go find that bald bastard
hey matt matt
the mind of les

verse les claypool
hit me
firecracker
so there you go
fifteen of your hardearned dollars right out the window
most expensive piece of plastic that ive ever come across
fifteen dollars
fifteen dollars on a shoddy piece of plastic
there it is limp bizkit in all its glory
fred durst the man the myth the compulsive masturbator
you love him you hate him
you love to hate him
hello hahaha
once when i was afraid to speak
when i was just a lad
my poppy gave my nose a tweak
and told me i was bad
then i learned a brilliant word
saved my aching nose
the biggest word youve ever heard
and this is how it goes
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
ah those were the days
i dont know
you got any more of that
im smokin em in a minute
so what did you think
you were getting a celine dion record
no no no young bucky
you laughed you cried
you just kissed your fifteen bucks goodbye
limp bizkit i dont think so
fred durst i dont know
but what the hell i got paid
goodbye nowembed"
