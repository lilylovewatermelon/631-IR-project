verse 1 lord of loneliness
its lonely at the top
all of my enemies have been defeated rip
the crown has been sitting on my head for too long
its starting to give me these lesions yeah yeah
dont follow the crowd the crowd is misleading
stay solo surrounded by all of my demons
licking my wounds as they deepen
constantly feeding them all of my secrets ayy
007 i got the golden gun i got the golden gun
im busting open up the door secrets
im at my breaking point i cannot take this shit no more
im ready to fucking explode
open up knockknock here comes the glock cocked
nine milli poppoppop oh no
making a mess my aim aint the best
i guess i should clean this all up and go home

verse 2 yung mane
percocet roxycodone with some xanax
that i had crushed up in some dust huh
elevated to another dimension
so i got a limp in my strut fuck
i do not care to be here or be there
in the meantime it seems that im stuck huh
swerving and crashing that dying little bastard
yung christ you address me as such what
crazy little demon they wave when they see me
face tatted from ear to ear yeah

if i cock it theres finna be tears here
manic depressive when life is in session
i hide in a room thats dark as me
