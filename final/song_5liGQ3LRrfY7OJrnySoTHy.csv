living in a city of sleepless people
who all know the limits and wont go too far
outside the lines
‘cause theyre out of their minds
i wanna get out and build my own home
on a street where reality is not much different
from dreams ive had
a dream is all i have

chorus
daydreaming
daydreaming all the time
daydreaming
daydreaming into the night
daydreaming
daydreaming all the time
daydreaming
daydreaming into the night
and im alright

verse 2
creep past the hours
like the shorter hand on the clock
hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
we wait for the bell
and we dream of somewhere else
