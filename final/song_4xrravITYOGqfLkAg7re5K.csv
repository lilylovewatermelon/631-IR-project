once upon a time in a faraway land a young prince lived in a shining castle although he had everything his heart desired the prince was spoiled selfish and unkind 

but then one winters night an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within and when he dismissed her again the old womans ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress 

the prince tried to apologize but it was too late for she had seen that there was no love in his heart and as punishment she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there 

ashamed of his monstrous form the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world 

the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his twentyfirst year if he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would be broken if not he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time 

as the years passed he fell into despair and lost all hope
for who could ever learn to love a beastyou might also likeembed"
