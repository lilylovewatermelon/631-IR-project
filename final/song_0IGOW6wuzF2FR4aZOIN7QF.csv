in my perfect isolation
i can stay here for a while
antidotes and revelations
just extend my own exile

chorus 1
wasting away the worlds right in front of me
funny you should say that its all in my head
wasting away were hitting rock bottom
and going down in flames well its not that bad

verse 2
with my lack of observation
i can stay in here for days
could you find my motivation
i cant see it through this haze

chorus 1

chorus 2
wishing away the worlds right in front of me
call me anyway ’cause its all in my head
wasting away were hitting rock bottom
and going down in flames well its not that bad
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likebridge
wasting all my days
what would ivan say
wasting all my days
what would ivan say

verse 3
wasting away were hitting rock bottom
and call me anyway ’cause i got two friends
wasting away were going down together
and all in all its not so bad
all in all its not so bad

its hard to know
where to start and where to go
i will never say these words again

chorus 1

chorus 2

wasting away
call me anyway
wasting away
going down in flames well its not that bad
