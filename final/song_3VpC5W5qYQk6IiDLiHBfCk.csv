this is the moment that you know
that you told her that you loved her but you dont
you touch her skin and then you think
that she is beautiful but she dont mean a thing to me
yeah she is beautiful but she dont mean a thing to me
verse 2
i spent two weeks in silver lake
the california sun cascading down my face
there was a girl with light brown streaks
and she was beautiful but she didnt mean a thing to me
yeah she was beautiful but she didnt mean a thing to me

bridge
i wanted to believe in all the words that i was speaking
as we moved together in the dark
and all the friends that i was telling all the playful misspellings
and every bite i gave that left a mark
when tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises
that you said you didnt want to fade
but they did and so did i that day

verse 3
all i see are dark grey clouds
in the distance moving closer with every hour
so when you ask is something wrong
i think youre damn right there is but we cant talk about it now
no we cant talk about it now

so one last touch and then youll go
and well pretend that it meant something so much more
but it was vile and it was cheap
and you are beautiful but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful but you dont mean a thing to me11embed"
