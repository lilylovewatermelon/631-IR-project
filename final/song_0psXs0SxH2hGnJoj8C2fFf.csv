and some man live his life for profits alone
that very same man he lives his life all alone
and in the road to life yes it goes up and down
doesnt really matter as long as the music goes on

chorus
hey mr collie man why dont you come round no more
hey mr collie man dont you hear me troubled call
hey mr collie man hope you didnt come to disturb
you best not be come round here unless youve got me sensi herb

verse 2
i never needed any reason for me to say
through all those troubled times yes me love you anyway
and the roughest path you know the rocky rocky road
you know that life and love is a heavy heavy load

chorus
hey mr collie man why dont you come round no more
hey mr collie man dont you hear me troubled call
hey mr collie man hope you didnt come to disturb
you best not be come round here unless youve got me sensi herb
you best not be come round here unless youve got me sensi herbyou might also like13embed"
