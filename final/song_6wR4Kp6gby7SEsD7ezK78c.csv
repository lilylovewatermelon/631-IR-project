scene first
on board a ship on the north sea off the norwegian coast
sunset stormy weather
peer gynt a vigorous old man with grizzled hair and beard is
standing aft on the poop he is dressed half sailorfashion with
a peajacket and long boots his clothing is rather the worse for
wear he himself is weatherbeaten and has a somewhat harder
expression the captain is standing beside the steersman at the
wheel the crew are forward
peer gynt leans with his arms on the bulwark and gazes towards the
land
look at hallingskarv in his winter furs
hes ruffling it old one in the evening glow
the jokel his brother stands behind him askew
hes got his green icemantle still on his back
the flogefann now she is mighty fine
lying there like a maiden in spotless white
dont you be madcaps old boys that you are
stand where you stand youre but granite knobs
the captain shouts forward
two hands to the wheel and the lantern aloft
peer
its blowing up stiff
the captain
for a gale tonight
peer
can one see the ronde hills from the sea
the captain
no how should you they lie at the back of the snowfields
peer
or blaho
the captain
no but from up in the rigging
youve a glimpse in clear weather of galdhopiggen
peer
where does harteig lie
the captain pointing
about over there
peer
i thought so
the captain
you know where you are it appears
peer
when i left the country i sailed by here
and the dregs says the proverb hang in to the last
spits and gazes at the coast
in there where the scaurs and the clefts lie blue
where the valleys like trenches gloom narrow and black
and underneath skirting the open fiords
its in places like these human beings abide
looks at the captain
they build far apart in this country
the captain
ay
few are the dwellings and far between
peer
shall we get in by daybreak
the captain
thereabouts
if we dont have too dirty a night altogether
peer
it grows thick in the west
the captain
it does so
peer
stop a bit
you might put me in mind when we make up accounts
im inclined as the phrase goes to do a good turn
to the crew
the captain
i thank you
peer
it wont be much
i have dug for gold and lost what i found
we are quite at loggerheads fate and i
you know what ive got in safe keeping on board
thats all i have leftthe rests gone to the devil
the captain
its more than enough though to make you of weight
among people at home here
peer
ive no relations
theres no one awaiting the rich old curmudgeon
well that saves you at least any scenes on the pier
the captain
here comes the storm
peer
well remember then
if any of your crew are in real need
i wont look too closely after the money
the captain
thats kind they are most of them ill enough off
they have all got their wives and their children at home
with their wages alone they can scarce make ends meet
but if they come home with some cash to the good
it will be a return not forgot in a hurry
peer
what do you say have they wives and children
are they married
the captain
married ay every man of them
but the one that is worst off of all is the cook
black famine is ever at home in his house
peer
married theyve folks that await them at home
folks to be glad when they come eh
the captain
of course
in poor peoples fashion
peer
and come they one evening
what then
the captain
why i daresay the goodwife will fetch
something good for a treat
peer
and a light in the sconce
the captain
ay ay may be two and a dram to their supper
peer
and there they sit snug theres a fire on the hearth
theyve their children about them the rooms full of chatter
not one hears another right out to an end
for the joy that is on them
the captain
its likely enough
so its really kind as you promised just now
to help eke things out
peer thumping the bulwark
ill be damned if i do
do you think i am mad would you have me fork out
for the sake of a parcel of other folks brats
ive slaved much too sorely in earning my cash
theres nobody waiting for old peer gynt
the captain
well well as you please then your moneys your own
peer
right mine it is and no one elses
well reckon as soon as your anchor is down
take my fare in the cabin from panama here
then brandy all round to the crew nothing more
if i give a doit more slap my jaw for me captain
the captain
i owe you a quittance and not a thrashing
but excuse me the winds blowing up to a gale
he goes forward it has fallen dark lights are lit in the cabin
the sea increases fog and thick clouds
peer
to have a whole bevy of youngsters at home
still to dwell in their minds as a coming delight
to have others thoughts follow you still on your path
theres never a soul gives a thought to me
lights in the sconces ill put out those lights
i will hit upon somethingill make them all drunk
not one of the devils shall go sober ashore
they shall all come home drunk to their children and wives
they shall curse bang the table till it rings again
they shall scare those that wait for them out of their wits
the goodwife shall scream and rush forth from the house
clutch her children along all their joy gone to ruin
 the ship gives a heavy lurch he staggers and keeps his balance with difficulty
why that was a buffet and no mistake
the seas hard at labour as though it were paid for it
its still itself here on the coasts of the north
a crosssea as wry and wrongheaded as ever
listens
why what can those screams be
the lookout forward
a wreck alee
the captain on the main deck shouts
helm hard astarboard bring her up to the wind
the mate
are there men on the wreck
the lookout
i can just see three
peer
quick lower the stern boat
the captain
shed fill ere she floated
  goes forward
peer
who can think of that now
to some of the crew
if youre men to the rescue
what the devil if you should get a bit of a ducking
the boatswain
its out of the question in such a sea
peer
they are screaming again theres a lull in the wind
cook will you risk it quick i will pay
the cook
no not if you offered me twenty poundssterling
peer
you hounds you chickenhearts can you forget
these are men that have goodwives and children at home
there theyre sitting and waiting
the boatswain
well patience is wholesome
the captain
bear away from that sea
the mate
there the wreck turned over
peer
all is silent of a sudden
the boatswain
were they married as you think
there are three newbaked widows even now in the world
    the storm increases peer gynt moves away aft
peer
there is no faith left among men any more
no christianitywell may they say it and write it
their good deeds are few and their prayers are still fewer
and they pay no respect to the powers above them
in a storm like tonights hes a terror the lord is
these beasts should be careful and think whats the truth
that its dangerous playing with elephants
and yet they must openly brave his displeasure
i am no whit to blame for the sacrifice
i can prove i stood ready my money in hand
but how does it profit mewhat says the proverb
a conscience at ease is a pillow of down
oh ay that is all very well on dry land
but im blest if it matters a snuff on board ship
when a decent mans out on the seas with such riffraff
at sea one never can be ones self
one must go with the others from deck to keel
if for boatswain and cook the hour of vengeance should strike
i shall no doubt be swept to the deuce with the rest
ones personal welfare is clean set aside
one counts but as a sausage in slaughteringtime
my mistake is this i have been too meek
and ive had no thanks for it after all
were i younger i think i would shift the saddle
and try how it answered to lord it awhile
there is time enough yet they shall know in the parish
that peer has come sailing aloft oer the seas
ill get back the farmstead by fair means or foul
i will build it anew it shall shine like a palace
but none shall be suffered to enter the hall
they shall stand at the gateway all twirling their caps
they shall beg and beseechthat they freely may do
but none gets so much as a farthing of mine
if ive had to howl neath the lashes of fate
trust me to find folks i can lash in my turn
the strange passenger stands in the darkness at peer gynts side
and salutes him in friendly fashion
good evening
peer
good evening what who are you
the passenger
your fellowpassenger at your service
peer
indeed i thought i was the only one
the passenger
a mistaken impression which now is set right
peer
but its singular that for the first time tonight
i should see you
the passenger
i never come out in the daytime
peer
perhaps you are ill youre as white as a sheet
the passenger
no thank youmy health is uncommonly good
peer
what a raging storm
the passenger
ay a blessed one man
peer
a blessed one
the passenger
the seas running high as houses
ah one can feel ones mouth watering
just think of the wrecks that tonight will be shattered
and think too what corpses will drive ashore
peer
lord save us
the passenger
have ever you seen a man strangled
or hangedor drowned
peer
this is going too far
the passenger
the corpses all laugh but their laughter is forced
and the most part are found to have bitten their tongues
peer
hold off from me
the passenger
only one question pray
if we for example should strike on a rock
and sink in the darkness
peer
you think there is danger
the passenger
i really dont know what i ought to say
but suppose now i float and you go to the bottom
peer
oh rubbish
the passenger
its just a hypothesis
but when one is placed with one foot in the grave
one grows softhearted and openhanded
peer puts his hand in his pocket
ho money
the passenger
no no but perhaps you would kindly
make me a gift of your muchesteemed carcass
peer
this is too much
the passenger
no more than your body you know
to help my researches in science
peer
begone
the passenger
but think my dear sirthe advantage is yours
ill have you laid open and brought to the light
what i specially seek is the centre of dreams
and with critical care ill look into your seams
peer
away with you
the passenger
why my dear sira drowned corpse
peer
blasphemer youre goading the rage of the storm
i call it too bad here its raining and blowing
a terrible sea on and all sorts of signs
of something thats likely to shorten our days
and you carry on so as to make it come quicker
the passenger
youre in no mood i see to negotiate further
but time you know brings with it many a change
 nods in a friendly fashion
well meet when youre sinking if not before
perhaps i may then find you more in the humour
    goes into the cabin
peer
unpleasant companions these scientists are
with their freethinking ways
     to the boatswain who is passing
hark a word with you friend
that passenger what crazy creature is he
the boatswain
i know of no passenger here but yourself
peer
no others this things getting worse and worse
    to the ships boy who comes out of the cabin
who went down the companion just now
the boy
the ships dog sir
passes on
the lookout shouts
land close ahead
peer
wheres my box wheres my trunk
all the baggage on deck
the boatswain
we have more to attend to
peer
it was nonsense captain twas only my joke
as sure as im here i will help the cook
the captain
the jibs blown away
the mate
and there went the foresail
the boatswain shrieks from forward
breakers under the bow
the captain
she will go to shivers
   the ship strikes noise and confusion
scene second
close under the land among sunken rocks and surf the ship
sinks the jollyboat with two men in her is seen for a moment
through the scud a sea strikes her she fills and upsets a shriek
is heard then all is silent for a while shortly afterwards the
boat appears floating bottom upwards
peer gynt comes to the surface near the boat
peer
help help a boat help ill be drowned
save me oh lordas saith the text
      clutches hold of the boats keel
the cook comes up on the other side
oh lord godfor my childrens sake
have mercy let me reach the land
   seizes hold of the keel
peer

the cook

the cook

peer

the other
peer

peer

for i am lone and childless still
the cook

peer
quick haste you sinkyou drag us down
the cook

theres none to miss and mourn for you
  his hand slips he screams

peer seizing him
by this wisp of hair
ill hold you say your lords prayer quick
the cook

peer
come the essentials in a word
the cook

peer

peer
the same old song
one sees you were a cook in life
the cook slips from his grasp
the cook sinking
give us this day our
     disappears
peer
amen lad
to the last gasp you were yourself
draws himself up on to the bottom of the boat
so long as there is life theres hope
the strange passenger catches hold of the boat
good morning
peer
hoy
the passenger
i heard you shout
its pleasant finding you again
well so my prophecy came true
peer
let go let go twill scarce float one
the passenger
im striking out with my left leg
ill float if only with their tips
my fingers rest upon this ledge
but apropos your body
peer
hush
the passenger
the rest of course is done for clean
peer
no more
the passenger
exactly as you please
      silence
peer
well
the passenger
i am silent
peer
satans tricks
what now
the passenger
im waiting
peer tearing his hair
ill go mad
what are you
the passenger nods
friendly
peer
what else speak
the passenger
what think you do you know none other
thats like me
peer
do i know the devil
the passenger in a low voice
is it his way to light a lantern
for lifes nightpilgrimage through fear
peer
ah come when once the things cleared up
youd seem a messenger of light
the passenger
friendhave you once in each halfyear
felt all the earnestness of dread
peer
why ones afraid when danger threatens
but all your words have double meanings
the passenger
ay have you gained but once in life
the victory that is given in dread
peer looks at him
came you to ope for me a door
twas stupid not to come before
what sort of sense is there in choosing
your time when seas gape to devour one
the passenger
were then the victory more likely
beside your hearthstone snug and quiet
peer
perhaps not but your talk befooled me
how could you fancy it awakening
the passenger
where i come from there smiles are prized
as highly as pathetic style
peer
all has its time what fits the taxman
so says the text would damn the bishop
the passenger
the host whose dust inurned has slumbered
treads not on weekdays the cothurnus
peer
avaunt thee bugbear man begone
i will not die i must ashore
the passenger
oh as for that be reassured
one dies not midmost of act five
   glides away
peer
ah there he let it out at last
he was a sorry moralist
scene third
churchyard in a highlying mountain parish
a funeral is going on by the grave the priest and a gathering
of people the last verse of the psalm is being sung peer gynt
passes by on the road
peer at the gate
heres a countryman going the way of all flesh
god be thanked that it isnt me
     enters the churchyard
the priest speaking beside the grave
now when the soul has gone to meet its doom
and here the dust lies like an empty pod
now my dear friends well speak a word or two
about this dead mans pilgrimage on earth
he was not wealthy neither was he wise
his voice was weak his bearing was unmanly
he spoke his mind abashed and faltering
he scarce was master at his own fireside
he sidled into church as though appealing
for leave like other men to take his place
it was from gudbrandsdale you know he came
when here he settled he was but a lad
and you remember how to the very last
he kept his right hand hidden in his pocket
that right hand in the pocket was the feature
that chiefly stamped his image on the mind
and therewithal his writhing his abashed
shrinking from notice wheresoeer he went
but though he still pursued a path aloof
and ever seemed a stranger in our midst
you all know what he strove so hard to hide
the hand he muffled had four fingers only
i well remember many years ago
one morning there were sessions held at lunde
twas wartime and the talk in every mouth
turned on the countrys sufferings and its fate
i stood there watching at the table sat
the captain twixt the bailiff and the sergeants
lad after lad was measured up and down
passed and enrolled and taken for a soldier
the room was full and from the green outside
where thronged the young folks loud the laughter rang
a name was called and forth another stepped
one pale as snow upon the glaciers edge
they bade the youth advance he reached the table
we saw his right hand swaddled in a clout
he gasped he swallowed battling after words
but though the captain urged him found no voice
ah yes at last then with his cheek aflame
his tongue now failing him now stammering fast
he mumbled something of a scythe that slipped
by chance and shore his finger to the skin
straightway a silence fell upon the room
men bandied meaning glances they made mouths
they stoned the boy with looks of silent scorn
he felt the hailstorm but he saw it not
then up the captain stood the grey old man
he spat and pointed forth and thundered go
and the lad went on both sides men fell back
till through their midst he had to run the gauntlet
he reached the door from there he took to flight
up up he wentthrough wood and over hillside
up through the stoneslips rough precipitous
he had his home up there among the mountains
it was some six months later he came here
with mother and betrothed and little child
he leased some ground upon the high hillside
there where the waste lands trend away towards lomb
he married the first moment that he could
he built a house he broke the stubborn soil
he throve as many a cultivated patch
bore witness bravely clad in waving gold
at church he kept his right hand in his pocket
but sure i am at home his fingers nine
toiled every bit as hard as others ten
one spring the torrent washed it all away
their lives were spared ruined and stripped of all
he set to work to make another clearing
and ere the autumn smoke again arose
from a new bettersheltered mountain farmhouse
sheltered from torrentnot from avalanche
two years and all beneath the snow lay buried
but still the avalanche could not daunt his spirit
he dug and raked and cartedcleared the ground
and the next winter ere the snowblasts came
a third time was his little homestead reared
three sons he had three bright and stirring boys
they must to school and school was far away
and they must clamber where the hilltrack failed
by narrow ledges through the headlong scaur
what did he do the eldest had to manage
as best he might and where the path was worst
his father cast a rope round him to stay him
the others on his back and arms he bore
thus he toiled year by year till they were men
now might he well have looked for some return
in the new world three prosperous gentlemen
their schoolgoing and their father have forgotten
he was shortsighted out beyond the circle
of those most near to him he nothing saw
to him seemed meaningless as cymbals tinkling
those words that to the heart should ring like steel
his race his fatherland all things high and shining
stood ever to his vision veiled in mist
but he was humble humble was this man
and since that sessionsday his doom oppressed him
as surely as his cheeks were flushed with shame
and his four fingers hidden in his pocket
offender gainst his countrys laws ay true
but there is one thing that the law outshineth
sure as the snowwhite tent of glittertind
has clouds like higher rows of peaks above it
no patriot was he both for church and state
a fruitless tree but there on the upland ridge
in the small circle where he saw his calling
there he was great because he was himself
his inborn note rang true unto the end
his days were as a lute with muted strings
and therefore peace be with thee silent warrior
that fought the peasants little fight and fell
it is not ours to search the heart and reins
that is no task for dust but for its ruler
yet dare i freely firmly speak my hope
he scarce stands crippled now before his god
  the gathering disperses peer gynt remains behind alone
peer
now that is what i call christianity
nothing to seize on ones mind unpleasantly
and the topicimmovably being oneself
that the pastors homily turned upon
is full in its essence of edification
  looks down upon the grave
was it he i wonder that hacked through his knuckle
that day i was out hewing logs in the forest
who knows if i werent standing here with my staff
by the side of the grave of this kinsman in spirit
i could almost believe it was i that slept
and heard in a vision my panegyric
its a seemly and christianlike custom indeed
this casting a socalled memorial glance
in charity over the life that is ended
i shouldnt at all mind accepting my verdict
at the hands of this excellent parish priest
ah well i dare say i have some time left
ere the gravedigger comes to invite me to stay with him
and as scripture has it whats best is best
and enough for the day is the evil thereof
and further discount not thy funeral
ah the church after all is the true consoler
ive hitherto scarcely appreciated it
but now i feel clearly how blessed it is
to be well assured upon sound authority
even as thou sowest thou shalt one day reap
one must be oneself for oneself and ones own
one must do ones best both in great and in small things
if the luck goes against you at least youve the honour
of a life carried through in accordance with principle
now homewards though narrow and steep the path
though fate to the end may be never so biting
still old peer gynt will pursue his own way
and remain what he is poor but virtuous ever
      goes out
scene fourth
a hillside seamed by the dry bed of a torrent a ruined
millhouse beside the stream the ground is torn up and the whole
place waste further up the hill a large farmhouse
an auction is going on in front of the farmhouse there is a great
gathering of people who are drinking with much noise peer gynt is
sitting on a rubbishheap beside the mill
peer
forward and back and its just as far
out and in and its just as strait
time wears away and the river gnaws on
go roundabout the boyg saidand here one must
a man dressed in mourning
now there is only rubbish left over
    catches sight of peer gynt
are there strangers here too god be with you good friend
peer
well met you have lively times here today
ist a christening junket or a wedding feast
the man in mourning
id rather call it a housewarming treat
the bride is laid in a wormy bed
peer
and the worms are squabbling for rags and clouts
the man in mourning
thats the end of the ditty its over and done
peer
all the ditties end just alike
and theyre all old together i knew em as a boy
a lad of twenty with a castingladle

peer
peer gynt who was he
the man in mourning

he was kinsman to death and to aslak the smith
a man in grey
youre forgetting me man are you mad or drunk
the man in mourning

the man in grey
ay true but we know you were never dainty
the man in mourning
if only she doesnt give death the slip
the man in grey
come kinsman a dram for our kinships sake
the man in mourning
to the deuce with your kinship youre maundering in drink
the man in grey
oh rubbish bloods never so thin as all that
one cannot but feel ones akin to peer gynt
    goes off with him
peer to himself
one meets with acquaintances
a lad calls after the man in mourning
mother thats dead
will be after you aslak if you wet your whistle
peer rises
the agriculturists saying seems scarce to hold here
the deeper one harrows the better it smells
a lad with a bears skin
look the cat of the dovre well only his fell
it was he chased the trolls out on christmas eve
another with a reindeerskull
here is the wonderful reindeer that bore
at gendin peer gynt over edge and scaur
a third with a hammer calls out to the man in mourning
hei aslak this sledgehammer say do you know it
was it this that you used when the devil clove the wall
a fourth emptyhanded
mads moen heres the invisible cloak
peer gynt and ingrid flew off through the air with
peer
brandy here boys i feel im grown old
i must put up to auction my rubbish and lumber
a lad
what have you to sell then
peer
a palace i have
it lies in the ronde its solidly built
the lad
a button is bid
peer
you must run to a dram
twere a sin and a shame to bid anything less
another
hes a jolly old boy this
the bystanders crowd round him
peer shouts
grane my steed
who bids
one of the crowd
wheres he running
peer
why far in the west
near the sunset my lads ah that courser can fly
as fast ay as fast as peer gynt could lie
voices
what more have you got
peer
ive both rubbish and gold
i bought it with ruin ill sell it at a loss
a lad
put it up
peer
a dream of a silverclasped book
that you can have for an old hook and eye
the lad
to the devil with dreams
peer
heres my kaiserdom
i throw it in the midst of you scramble for it
the lad
is the crown given in
peer
of the loveliest straw
it will fit whoever first puts it on
hei there is more yet an addled egg
a madmans grey hair and the prophets beard
all these shall be his that will show on the hillside
a post that has writ on it here lies your path
the bailiff who has come up
youre carrying on my good man so that almost
i think that your path will lead straight to the lockup
peer hat in hand
quite likely but tell me who was peer gynt
the bailiff
oh nonsense
peer
your pardon most humbly i beg
the bailiff
oh hes said to have been an abominable liar
peer
a liar
the bailiff
yesall that was strong and great
he made believe always that he had done it
but excuse me friendi have other duties
goes
peer
and where is he now this remarkable man
an elderly man
he fared over seas to a foreign land
it went ill with him there as one well might foresee
its many a year now since he was hanged
peer
hanged ay ay why i thought as much
our lamented peer gynt was himself to the last
bows
goodbyeand best thanks for todays merry meeting
 goes a few steps but stops again
you joyous youngsters you comely lasses
shall i pay my shot with a travellers tale
several voices
yes do you know any
peer
nothing more easy
   he comes nearer a look of strangeness comes over him
i was golddigging once in san francisco
there were mountebanks swarming all over the town
one with his toes could perform on the fiddle
another could dance a spanish halling on his knees
a third i was told kept on making verses
while his brainpan was having a hole bored right through it
to the mountebankmeeting came also the devil
thought hed try his luck with the rest of them
his talent was this in a manner convincing
he was able to grunt like a fleshandblood pig
he was not recognised yet his manners attracted
the house was well filled expectation ran high
he stepped forth in a cloak with an ample cape to it
man muss sich drappiren as the germans say
but under the mantlewhat none suspected
hed managed to smuggle a real live pig
and now he opened the representation
the devil he pinched and the pig gave voice
the whole thing purported to be a fantasia
on the porcine existence both free and in bonds
and all ended up with a slaughterhouse squeal
whereupon the performer bowed low and retired
the critics discussed and appraised the affair
the tone of the whole was attacked and defended
some fancied the vocal expression too thin
while some thought the deathshriek too carefully studied
but all were agreed as to one thing qua grunt
the performance was grossly exaggerated
now that you see came of the devils stupidity
in not taking the measure of his public first
he bows and goes off a puzzled silence comes over the crowd
scene fifth
whitsun evein the depths of the forest to the back in a
clearing is a hut with a pair of reindeer horns over the
porchgable
peer gynt is creeping among the undergrowth gathering wild
onions
peer
well this is one standpoint where is the next
one should try all things and choose the best
well i have done sobeginning from caesar
and downwards as far as to nebuchadnezzar
so i had after all to go through bible history
the old boys had to take to his mother again
after all it is written of the earth art thou come
the main thing in life is to fill ones belly
fill it with onions thats not much good
i must take to cunning and set out snares
theres water in the beck here i shant suffer thirst
and i count as the first mong the beasts after all
when my time comes to dieas most likely it will
i shall crawl in under a windfallen tree
like the bear i will heap up a leafmound above me
and ill scratch in big print on the bark of the tree
here rests peer gynt that decent soul
kaiser oer all of the other beasts
kaiser
    laughs inwardly
why you old soothsayerhumbug
no kaiser are you you are nought but an onion
im going to peel you now my good peer
you wont escape either by begging or howling
  takes an onion and pulls off layer after layer
there lies the outermost layer all torn
thats the shipwrecked man on the jollyboats keel
heres the passenger layer scanty and thin
and yet in its taste theres a tang of peer gynt
next underneath is the golddigger ego
the juice is all goneif it ever had any
this coarsegrained layer with the hardened skin
is the peltryhunter by hudsons bay
the next one looks like a crownoh thanks
well throw it away without more ado
heres the archaeologist short but sturdy
and here is the prophet juicy and fresh
he stinks as the scripture has it of lies
enough to bring the water to an honest mans eyes
this layer that rolls itself softly together
is the gentleman living in ease and good cheer
the next one seems sick there are black streaks upon it
black symbolises both parsons and niggers
    pulls off several layers at once
what an enormous number of swathings
isnt the kernel soon coming to light
     pulls the whole onion to pieces
im blest if it is to the innermost centre
its nothing but swathingseach smaller and smaller
nature is witty
throws the fragments away
the devil take brooding
if one goes about thinking ones apt to stumble
well i can at any rate laugh at that danger
for here on all fours i am firmly planted
   scratches his head
a queer enough business the whole concern
life as they say plays with cards up its sleeve
but when one snatches at them theyve disappeared
and one grips something elseor else nothing at all
he has come near to the hut he catches sight of it and starts
this hut on the heath ha
    rubs his eyes
it seems exactly
as though i had known this same building before
the reindeerhorns jutting above the gable
a mermaid shaped like a fish from the navel
lies theres no mermaid but nailsand planks
bars too to shut out hobgoblin thoughts
solveig singing in the hut
now all is ready for whitsun eve
dearest boy of mine far away
comest thou soon
is thy burden heavy
take time take time
i will await thee
i promised of old
peer rises quiet and deadly pale
one thats rememberedand one thats forgot
one that has squanderedand one that has saved
oh earnestand never can the game be played oer
oh dreadhere was my kaiserdom
   hurries off along the wood path
scene sixth
night a heath with firtrees a forest fire has been raging
charred treetrunks are seen stretching for miles white mists here
and there clinging to the earth
peer gynt comes running over the heath
peer
ashes fogscuds dust winddriven
heres enough for building with
stench and rottenness within it
all a whited sepulchre
figments dreams and stillborn knowledge
lay the pyramids foundation
oer them shall the work mount upwards
with its step on step of falsehood
earnest shunned repentance dreaded
flaunt at the apex like a scutcheon
fill the trump of judgment with their
petrus gyntus caesar fecit
     listens
what is this like childrens weeping
weeping but halfway to song
threadballs at my feet are rolling
 kicking at them
off with you you block my path
the threadballs on the ground
we are thoughts
thou shouldst have thought us
feet to run on
thou shouldst have given us
peer going round about
i have given life to one
twas a bungled crooklegged thing
the threadballs
we should have soared up
like clangorous voices
and here we must trundle
as greyyarn threadballs
peer stumbling
threadclue you accursed scamp
would you trip your fathers heels
    flees
withered leaves flying before the wind
we are a watchword
thou shouldst have proclaimed us
see how thy dozing
has wofully riddled us
the worm has gnawed us
in every crevice
we have never twined us
like wreaths round fruitage
peer
not in vain your birth however
lie but still and serve as manure
a sighing in the air
we are songs
thou shouldst have sung us
a thousand times over
hast thou cowed us and smothered us
down in thy hearts pit
we have lain and waited
we were never called forth
in thy gorge be poison
peer
poison thee thou foolish stave
had i time for verse and stuff
      attempts a short cut
dewdrops dripping from the branches
we are tears
unshed for ever
icespears sharpwounding
we could have melted
now the barb rankles
in the shaggy bosom
the wound is closed over
our power is ended
peer
thanksi wept in rondecloisters
none the less they tied the tail on
broken straws
we are deeds
thou shouldst have achieved us
doubt the throttler
has crippled and riven us
on the day of judgment
well come aflock
and tell the story
then woe to you
peer
rascaltricks how dare you debit
what is negative against me
 hastens away
ases voice far away
fie what a postboy
hu youve upset me
snows newly fallen here
sadly its smirched me
youve driven me the wrong way
peer wheres the castle
the fiend has misled you
with the switch from the cupboard
peer
better haste away poor fellow
with the devils sins upon you
soon youll faint upon the hillside
hard enough to bear ones own sins
     runs off
scene seventh
another part of the heath
peer gynt sings
a sexton a sexton where are you hounds
a song from braying precentormouths
around your hatbrim a mourning band
my dead are many i must follow their biers
the buttonmoulder with a box of tools and a large castingladle
comes from a sidepath
the buttonmoulder
well met old gaffer
peer
good evening friend
the buttonmoulder
the mans in a hurry why where is he going
peer
to a gravefeast
the buttonmoulder
indeed my sights not very good
excuse meyour name doesnt chance to be peer
peer
peer gynt as the saying is
the buttonmoulder
that i call luck
its precisely peer gynt i am sent for tonight
peer
youre sent for what do you want
the buttonmoulder
why see here
im a buttonmoulder youre to go into my ladle
peer
and what to do there
the buttonmoulder
to be melted up
peer
to be melted
the buttonmoulder
here it is empty and scoured
your grave is dug ready your coffin bespoke
the worms in your body will live at their ease
but i have orders without delay
on masters behalf to fetch in your soul
peer
it cant be like this without any warning
the buttonmoulder
its an old tradition at burials and births
to appoint in secret the day of the feast
with no warning at all to the guest of honour
peer
ay ay thats true all my brains awhirl
you are
the buttonmoulder
why i told youa buttonmoulder
peer
i see a pet child has many nicknames
so thats it peer it is there youre to harbour
but these my good man are most unfair proceedings
im sure i deserve better treatment than this
im not nearly so bad as perhaps you think
ive done a good deal of good in the world
at worst you may call me a sort of a bungler
but certainly not an exceptional sinner
the buttonmoulder
why that is precisely the rub my man
youre no sinner at all in the higher sense
thats why youre excused all the torturepangs
and land like others in the castingladle
peer
give it what name you pleasecall it ladle or pool
spruce ale and swipes they are both of them beer
avaunt from me satan
the buttonmoulder
you cant be so rude
as to take my foot for a horses hoof
peer
on horses hoof or on foxs claws
be off and be careful what youre about
the buttonmoulder
my friend youre making a great mistake
were both in a hurry and so to save time
ill explain the reason of the whole affair
you are with your own lips you told me so
no sinner on the socalled heroic scale
scarce middling even
peer
ah now youre beginning
to talk common sense
the buttonmoulder
just have patience a bit
but to call you virtuous would be going too far
peer
well you know i have never laid claim to that
the buttonmoulder
youre nor one thing nor tother then only soso
a sinner of really grandiose style
is nowadays not to be met on the highways
it wants much more than merely to wallow in mire
for both vigour and earnestness go to a sin
peer
ay its very true that remark of yours
one has to lay on like the old berserkers
the buttonmoulder
you friend on the other hand took your sin lightly
peer
only outwardly friend like a splash of mud
the buttonmoulder
ah well soon be at one now the sulphur pool
is no place for you who but plashed in the mire
peer
and in consequence friend i can go as i came
the buttonmoulder
no in consequence friend i must melt you up
peer
what tricks are these that youve hit upon
at home here while ive been in foreign parts
the buttonmoulder
the customs as old as the snakes creation
its designed to prevent loss of good material
youve worked at the craftyou must know that often
a casting turns out to speak plainly mere dross
the buttons for instance have sometimes no loop to them
what did you do then
peer
flung the rubbish away
the buttonmoulder
ah yes jon gynt was well known for a waster
so long as hed aught left in wallet or purse
but master you see he is thrifty he is
and that is why hes so welltodo
he flings nothing away as entirely worthless
that can be made use of as raw material
now you were designed for a shining button
on the vest of the world but your loop gave way
so into the wastebox you needs must go
and then as they phrase it be merged in the mass
peer
youre surely not meaning to melt me up
with dick tom and harry into something new
the buttonmoulder
thats just what i do mean and nothing else
weve done it already to plenty of folks
at kongsberg they do just the same with money
thats been current so long that its stamps worn away
peer
but this is the wretchedest miserliness
my dear good friend let me get off free
a loopless button a worn out farthing
what is that to a man in your masters position
the buttonmoulder
oh so long and inasmuch as the spirits in one
one always has value as so much metal
peer
no i say no with both teeth and claws
ill fight against this sooner anything else
the buttonmoulder
but what else come now be reasonable
you know youre not airy enough for heaven
peer
im not hard to content i dont aim so high
but i wont be deprived of one doit of my self
have me judged by the law in the oldfashioned way
for a certain time place me with him of the hoof
say a hundred years come the worst to the worst
that now is a thing that one surely can bear
for they say the torment is only moral
so it cant after all be so pyramidal
it is as tis written a mere transition
and as the fox said one waits there comes
an hour of deliverance one lives in seclusion
and hopes in the meantime for happier days
but this other notionto have to be merged
like a mote in the carcass of some outsider
this castingladle business this gyntcessation
it stirs up my innermost soul in revolt
the buttonmoulder
bless me my dear peer there is surely no need
to get so wrought up about trifles like this
yourself you never have been at all
then what does it matter your dying right out
peer
have i not been i could almost laugh
peer gynt then has been something else i suppose
no buttonmoulder you judge in the dark
if you could but look into my very reins
youd find only peer there and peer all through
nothing else in the world no nor anything more
the buttonmoulder
its impossible here i have got my orders
look here it is written peer gynt shalt thou summon
he has set at defiance his lifes design
clap him into the ladle with other spoilt goods
peer
what nonsense they must mean some other person
is it really peer its not rasmus or jon
the buttonmoulder
it is many a day since i melted them
so come quietly now and dont waste my time
peer
ill be damned if i do ay twould be a fine thing
if it turned out tomorrow some one else was meant
youd better take care what youre at my good man
think of the onus youre taking upon you
the buttonmoulder
i have it in writing
peer
at least give me time
the buttonmoulder
what good would that do you
peer
ill use it to prove
that ive been myself all the days of my life
and thats the question thats in dispute
the buttonmoulder
youll prove it and how
peer
why by vouchers and witnesses
the buttonmoulder
im sadly afraid master will not accept them
peer
impossible however enough for the day
my dear man allow me a loan of myself
ill be back again shortly one is born only once
and ones self as created one fain would stick to
come are we agreed
the buttonmoulder
very well then so be it
but remember we meet at the next crossroads
 peer gynt runs off
scene eighth
a further point on the heath
peer running hard
time is money as the scripture says
if i only knew where the crossroads are
they may be near and they may be far
the earth burns beneath me like redhot iron
a witness a witness oh where shall i find one
its almost unthinkable here in the forest
the world is a bungle a wretched arrangement
when a man must prove a right thats as patent as day
an old man bent with age with a staff in his hand and a bag on
his back is trudging in front of him
the old man stops
dear kind sira trifle to a houseless soul
peer
excuse me ive got no small change in my pocket
the old man
prince peer oh to think we should meet again
peer
who are you
the old man
you forget the old man in the ronde
peer
why youre never
the old man
the king of the dovre my boy
peer
the dovreking really the dovreking speak
the old man
oh ive come terribly down in the world
peer
ruined
the old man
ay plundered of every stiver
here am i tramping it starved as a wolf
peer
hurrah such a witness doesnt grow on the trees
the old man
my lord prince too has grizzled a bit since we met
peer
my dear fatherinlaw the years gnaw and wear one
well well a truce to all private affairs
and pray above all things no family jars
i was then a sad madcap
the old man
oh yes oh yes
his highness was young and what wont one do then
but his highness was wise in rejecting his bride
he saved himself thereby both worry and shame
for since then shes utterly gone to the bad
peer
indeed
the old man
she has led a deplorable life
and just thinkshe and trond are now living together
peer
which trond
the old man
of the valfjeld
peer
its he aha
it was he i cut out with the saetergirls
the old man
but my grandson has flourishedgrown both stout and great
and has strapping children all over the country
peer
now my dear man spare us this flow of words
ive something quite different troubling my mind
ive got into rather a ticklish position
and am greatly in need of a witness or voucher
thats how you could help me best fatherinlaw
and ill find you a trifle to drink my health with
the old man
you dont say so can i be of use to his highness
youll give me a character then in return
peer
most gladly im somewhat hard pressed for cash
and must cut down expenses in every direction
now hear whats the matter no doubt you remember
that night when i came to the ronde awooing
the old man
why of course my lord prince
peer
oh no more of the prince
but no matter you wanted by sheer brute force
to bias my sight with a slit in the lens
and to change me about from peer gynt to a troll
what did i do then i stood out against it
swore i would stand on no feet but my own
love power and glory at once i renounced
and all for the sake of remaining myself
now this fact you see you must swear to in court
the old man
no im blest if i can
peer
why what nonsense is this
the old man
you surely dont want to compel me to lie
you pulled on the trollbreeches dont you remember
and tasted the mead
peer
ay you lured me seductively
but i flatly declined the decisive test
and that is the thing you must judge your man by
its the end of the ditty that all depends on
the old man
but it ended peer just in the opposite way
peer
what rubbish is this
the old man
when you left the ronde
you inscribed my motto upon your scutcheon
peer
what motto
the old man
the potent and sundering word
peer
the word
the old man
that which severs the whole race of men
from the trollfolktroll to thyself be enough
peer falls back a step
enough
the old man
and with every nerve in your body
youve being living up to it ever since
peer
what i peer gynt
the old man weeps
its ungrateful of you
youve lived as a troll but have still kept it secret
the word i taught you has shown you the way
to swing yourself up as a man of substance
and now you must needs come and turn up your nose
at me and the word youve to thank for it all
peer
enough a hilltroll an egoist
this must be all rubbish thats perfectly certain
the old man pulls out a bundle of old newspapers
i daresay you think that weve no newspapers
wait here ill show you in red and black
how the bloksberg post eulogises you
and the heklefield journal has done the same
ever since the winter you left the country
do you care to read them youre welcome peer
heres an article look you signed stallionhoof
and here too is one on trollnationalism
the writer points out and lays stress on the truth
that horns and a tail are of little importance
so long as one has but a strip of the hide
our enough he concludes gives the hallmark of trolldom
to manand proceeds to cite you as an instance
peer
a hilltroll i
the old man
yes thats perfectly clear
peer
might as well have stayed quietly where i was
might have stopped in the ronde in comfort and peace
saved my trouble and toil and no end of shoeleather
peer gynta troll why its rubbish its stuff
goodbye theres a halfpenny to buy you tobacco
the old man
nay my good prince peer
peer
let me go youre mad
or else doting off to the hospital with you
the old man
oh that is exactly what im in search of
but as i told you my grandsons offspring
have become overwhelmingly strong in the land
and they say that i only exist in books
the saw says ones kin are unkindest of all
ive found to my cost that that saying is true
its cruel to count as mere figment and fable
peer
my dear man there are others who share the same fate
the old man
and ourselves weve no mutual aid society
no almsbox or penny savings bank
in the ronde of course theyd be out of place
peer
no that cursed to thyself be enough was the word there
the old man
oh come now the prince cant complain of the word
and if he could manage by hook or by crook
peer
my man you have got on the wrong scent entirely
im myself as the saying goes fairly cleaned out
the old man
you surely cant mean it his highness a beggar
peer
completely his highnesss egos in pawn
and its all your fault you accursed trolls
thats what comes of keeping bad company
the old man
so there came my hope toppling down from its perch again
goodbye i had best struggle on to the town
peer
what would you do there
the old man
i will go to the theatre
the papers are clamouring for national talents
peer
good luck on your journey and greet them from me
if i can but get free i will go the same way
a farce i will write them a mad and profound one
its name shall be sic transit gloria mundi
  he runs off along the road the old man shouts after him

scene ninth
at a crossroad
peer gynt
now comes the pinch peer as never before
this dovrish enough has passed judgment upon you
the vessels a wreck one must float with the spars
all else only not to the spoiltgoods heap
the buttonmoulder at the crossroad
well now peer gynt have you found your voucher
peer
have we reached the crossroad well thats short work
the buttonmoulder
i can see on your face as it were on a signboard
the gist of the paper before ive read it
peer
i got tired of the huntone might lose ones way
the buttonmoulder
yes and what does it lead to after all
peer
true enough in the wood and by night as well
the buttonmoulder
theres an old man though trudging shall we call him here
peer
no let him go he is drunk my dear fellow
the buttonmoulder
but perhaps he might
peer
hush nolet him be
the buttonmoulder
well shall we turn to then
peer
one question only
what is it at bottom this being oneself
the buttonmoulder
a singular question most odd in the mouth
of a man who just now
peer
come a straightforward answer
the buttonmoulder
to be oneself is to slay oneself
but on you that answer is doubtless lost
and therefore well say to stand forth everywhere
with masters intention displayed like a signboard
peer
but suppose a man never has come to know
what master meant with him
the buttonmoulder
he must divine it
peer
but how oft are divinings beside the mark
then ones carried ad undas in middle career
the buttonmoulder
that is certain peer gynt in default of divining
the clovenhoofed gentleman finds his best hook
peer
this matters excessively complicated
see here i no longer plead being myself
it might not be easy to get it proven
that part of my case i must look on as lost
but just now as i wandered alone oer the heath
i felt my conscienceshoe pinching me
i said to myself after all youre a sinner
the buttonmoulder
you seem bent on beginning all over again
peer
no very far from it a great one i mean
not only in deeds but in words and desires
ive lived a most damnable life abroad
the buttonmoulder
perhaps i must ask you to show me the schedule
peer
well well give me time i will find out a parson
confess with all speed and then bring you his voucher
the buttonmoulder
ay if you can bring me that then it is clear
you escape this business of the castingladle
but peer id my orders
peer
the paper is old
it dates no doubt from a long past period
at one time i lived with disgusting slackness
went playing the prophet and trusted in fate
well may i try
the buttonmoulder
but
peer
my dear fellow
im sure you cant have so much to do
here in this district the air is so bracing
it adds an ell to the peoples ages
recollect what the justedal parson wrote
its seldom that any one dies in this valley
the buttonmoulder
to the next crossroads then but not a step further
peer
a priest i must catch if it be with the tongs
      he starts running
scene tenth
a heatherclad hillside with a path following the windings of the
ridge
peer
this may come in useful in many ways
said esben as he picked up a magpies wing
who could have thought ones account of sins
would come to ones aid on the last night of all
well whether or no its a ticklish business
a move from the fryingpan into the fire
but then theres a proverb of welltried validity
which says that as long as theres life theres hope
a lean person in a priests cassock kiltedup high and with a
birding net over his shoulder comes hurrying along the ridge
peer
who goes there a priest with a fowlingnet
hei hop im the spoilt child of fortune indeed
good evening herr pastor the path is bad
the lean one
ah yes but what wouldnt one do for a soul
peer
aha then theres some one bound heavenwards
the lean one
no
i hope he is taking a different road
peer
may i walk with herr pastor a bit of the way
the lean one
with pleasure im partial to company
peer
i should like to consult you
the lean one
heraus go ahead
peer
you see here before you a good sort of man
the laws of the state i have strictly observed
have made no acquaintance with fetters or bolts
but it happens at times that one misses ones footing
and stumbles
the lean one
ah yes that occurs to the best of us
peer
now these trifles you see
the lean one
only trifles
peer
yes
from sinning en gros i have ever refrained
the lean one
oh then my dear fellow pray leave me in peace
im not the person you seem to think me
you look at my fingers what see you in them
peer
a nailsystem somewhat extremely developed
the lean one
and now you are casting a glance at my feet
peer pointing
thats a natural hoof
the lean one
so i flatter myself
peer raises his hat
id have taken my oath you were simply a parson
and i find ive the honour well best is best
when the hall door stands wideshun the kitchen way
when the kings to be met withavoid the lackey
the lean one
your hand you appear to be free from prejudice
say on then my  friend in what way can i serve you
now you mustnt ask me for wealth or power
i couldnt supply them although i should hang for it
you cant think how slack the whole business is
transactions have dwindled most pitiably
nothing doing in souls only now and again
a stray one
peer
the race has improved so remarkably
the lean one
no just the reverse its sunk shamefully low
the majority end in a castingladle
peer
ah yesi have heard that ladle mentioned
in fact twas the cause of my coming to you
the lean one
speak out
peer
if it were not too much to ask
i should like
the lean one
a harbour of refuge eh
peer
youve guessed my petition before i have asked
you tell me the business is going awry
so i daresay you will not be overparticular
the lean one
but my dear
peer
my demands are in no way excessive
i shouldnt insist on a salary
but treatment as friendly as things will permit
the lean one
a fire in your room
peer
not too much fireand chiefly
the power of departing in safety and peace
the right as the phrase goes of freely withdrawing
should an opening offer for happier days
the lean one
my dear friend i vow im sincerely distressed
but you cannot imagine how many petitions
of similar purport good people send in
when theyre quitting the scene of their earthly activity
peer
but now that i think of my past career
i feel ive an absolute claim to admission
the lean one
twas but trifles you said
peer
in a certain sense
but now i remember ive trafficked in slaves
the lean one
there are men that have trafficked in wills and souls
but who bungled it so that they failed to get in
peer
ive shipped bramahfigures in plenty to china
the lean one
mere fustian again why we laugh at such things
there are people that ship off far gruesomer figures
in sermons in art and in literature
yet have to stay out in the cold
peer
ah but then
do you knowi once went and set up as prophet
the lean one
in foreign parts humbug why most peoples sehen
ins blaue ends in the castingladle
if youve no more than that to rely upon
with the best of goodwill i cant possibly house you
peer
but hear this in a shipwrecki clung to a boats keel
and its written a drowning man grasps at a straw
furthermore it is written youre nearest yourself
so i halfway divested a cook of his life
the lean one
it were all one to me if a kitchenmaid
you had halfway divested of something else
what sort of stuff is this halfway jargon
saving your presence who think you would care
to throw away dearlybought fuel in times
like these on such spiritless rubbish as this
there now dont be enraged twas your sins that scoffed at
and excuse my speaking my mind so bluntly
come my dearest friend banish this stuff from your head
and get used to the thought of the castingladle
what would you gain if i lodged you and boarded you
consider i know youre a sensible man
well youd keep your memory thats so far true

but the retrospect oer recollections domain
would be both for heart and for intellect
what the swedes call mighty poor sport indeed
you have nothing either to howl or to smile about
no cause for rejoicing nor yet for despair
nothing to make you feel hot or cold
only a sort of a something to fret over
peer
it is written its never so easy to know
where the shoe is tight that one isnt wearing
the lean one
very true i havepraise be to soandso
no occasion for more than a single odd shoe
but its lucky we happened to speak of shoes
it reminds me that i must be hurrying on
im after a roast that i hope will prove fat
so i really mustnt stand gossiping here
peer
and may one inquire then what sort of sindiet
the man has been fattened on
the lean one
i understand
he has been himself both by night and by day
and that after all is the principal point
peer
himself then do such folks belong to your parish
the lean one
that depends the door at least stands ajar for them
remember in two ways a man can be
himselftheres a right and wrong side to the jacket
you know they have lately discovered in paris
a way to take portraits by help of the sun
one can either produce a straightforward picture
or else what is known as a negative one
in the latter the lights and the shades are reversed
and theyre apt to seem ugly to commonplace eyes
but for all that the likeness is latent in them
and all you require is to bring it out
if then a soul shall have pictured itself
in the course of its life by the negative method
the plate is not therefore entirely cashiered
but without more ado they consign it to me
i take it in hand then for further treatment
and by suitable methods effect its development
i steam it i dip it i burn it i scour it
with sulphur and other ingredients like that
till the image appears which the plate was designed for
that namely which people call positive
but if one like you has smudged himself out
neither sulphur nor potash avails in the least
peer
i see one must come to you black as a raven
to turn out a white ptarmigan pray whats the name
inscribed neath the negative counterfeit
that youre now to transfer to the positive side
the lean one
the names peter gynt
peer
peter gynt indeed
is herr gynt himself
the lean one
yes he vows he is
peer
well hes one to be trusted that same herr peter
the lean one
you know him perhaps
peer
oh yes after a fashion
one knows all sorts of people
the lean one
im pressed for time
where saw you him last
peer
it was down at the cape
the lean one
di buona speranza
peer
just so but he sails
very shortly again if im not mistaken
the lean one
i must hurry off then without delay
i only hope i may catch him in time
that cape of good hopei could never abide it
its ruined by missionaries from stavanger
he rushes off southwards
peer
the stupid hound there he takes to his heels
with his tongue lolling out hell be finely sold
it delights me to humbug an ass like that
he to give himself airs and to lord it forsooth
hes a mighty lot truly to swagger about
hell scarcely grow fat at his present trade
hell soon drop from his perch with his whole apparatus
hm im not oversafe in the saddle either
     a shooting star is seen he nods after it
im expelled one may say from selfowning nobility
bear all hail from peer gynt brother starryflash
to flash forth to go out and be naught at a gulp
pulls himself together as though in terror and goes deeper in
among the mists stillness for awhile then he cries
is there no one no one in all the turmoil
in the void no one no one in heaven
he comes forward again further down throws his hat upon the
ground and tears at his hair by degrees a stillness comes over him
so unspeakably poor then a soul can go
back to nothingness into the grey of the mist
thou beautiful earth be not angry with me
that i trampled thy grasses to no avail
thou beautiful sun thou hast squandered away
thy glory of light in an empty hut
there was no one within it to hearten and warm
the owner they tell me was never at home
beautiful sun and beautiful earth
you were foolish to bear and give light to my mother
the spirit is niggard and nature lavish
and dearly one pays for ones birth with ones life
i will clamber up high to the dizziest peak
i will look once more on the rising sun
gaze till im tired oer the promised land
then try to get snowdrifts piled up over me
they can write above them here no one lies buried
and afterwardsthen let things go as they can
churchgoers singing on the forest path
oh morning thrice blessed
when the tongues of gods kingdom
struck the earth like to flaming steel
from the earth to his dwelling
now the heirs song ascendeth
in the tongue of the kingdom of god
peer crouches as in terror
never look there there alls desert and waste
i fear i was dead long before i died
tries to slink in among the bushes but comes upon the
crossroads
the buttonmoulder
good morning peer gynt wheres the list of your sins
peer
do you think that i havent been whistling and shouting
as hard as i could
the buttonmoulder
and met no one at all
peer
not a soul but a tramping photographer
the buttonmoulder
well the respite is over
peer
ay everythings over
the owl smells the daylight just list to the hooting
the buttonmoulder
its the matinbell ringing
peer pointing
whats that shining yonder
the buttonmoulder
only light from a hut
peer
and that wailing sound
the buttonmoulder
but a woman singing
peer
ay therethere ill find
the list of my sins
the buttonmoulder seizing him
set your house in order
they have come out of the underwood and are standing near the hut
day is dawning
peer
set my house in order its there away
get you gone though your ladle were huge as a coffin
it were too small i tell you for me and my sins
the buttonmoulder
well to the third crossroad peer but then
turns aside and goes
peer approaches the hut
forward and back and its just as far
out and in and its just as strait
 stops
nolike a wild an unending lament
is the thought to come back to go in to go home
   takes a few steps on but stops again
roundabout said the boyg
     hears singing in the hut
ah no this time at least
right through though the path may be never so strait
he runs towards the hut at the same moment solveig appears in
the doorway dressed for church with psalmbook wrapped in a
kerchief and a staff in her hand she stands there erect and mild
peer flings himself down on the threshold
hast thou doom for a sinner then speak it forth
solveig
he is here he is here oh to god be the praise
   stretches out her arms as though groping for him
peer
cry out all my sins and my trespasses
solveig
in nought hast thou sinned oh my own only boy
  gropes for him again and finds him
the buttonmoulder behind the house
the sinlist peer gynt
peer
cry aloud my crime
solveig sits down beside him
thou hast made all my life as a beautiful song
blessed be thou that at last thou hast come
blessed thrice blessed our whitsunmorn meeting
peer
then i am lost
solveig
there is one that rules all things
peer laughs
lost unless thou canst answer riddles
solveig
tell me them
peer
tell them come on to be sure
canst thou tell where peer gynt has been since we parted
solveig
been
peer
with his destinys seal on his brow
been as in gods thought he first sprang forth
canst thou tell me if not i must get me home
go down to the mistshrouded regions
solveig smiling
oh that riddle is easy
peer
then tell what thou knowest
where was i as myself as the whole man the true man
where was i with gods sigil upon my brow
solveig
in my faith in my hope and in my love
peer starts back
what sayest thou peace these are juggling words
thou art mother thyself to the man thats there
solveig
ay that i am but who is his father
surely he that forgives at the mothers prayer
peer a light shines in his face he cries
my mother my wife oh thou innocent woman
in thy loveoh there hide me hide me
clings to her and hides his face in her lap a long silence the
sun rises
solveig sings softly
sleep thou dearest boy of mine
i will cradle thee i will watch thee
the boy has been sitting on his mothers lap
they two have been playing all the lifeday long
the boy has been resting at his mothers breast
all the lifeday long gods blessing on my joy
the boy has been lying close in to my heart
all the lifeday long he is weary now
sleep thou dearest boy of mine
i will cradle thee i will watch thee
the buttonmoulders voice behind the house
well meet at the last crossroad again peer
and then well see whether i say no more
solveig sings louder in the full daylight
i will cradle thee i will watch thee
sleep and dream thou dear my boy
the endembed"
