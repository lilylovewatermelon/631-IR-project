please come now i think im falling
im holding on to all i think is safe
it seems i found the road to nowhere
and im trying to escape
i yelled back when i heard thunder
but im down to one last breath
and with it let me say
let me say

chorus
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down

verse 2
im looking down now that its over
reflecting on all of my mistakes
i thought i found the road to somewhere
somewhere in his grace
i cried out heaven save me
but im down to one last breath
and with it let me say
let me say

chorus
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down
im so far down

but i still believe
theres something left for me
so please come stay with me
cause i still believe
theres something left for you and me
for you and me
for you and me

refrain
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking

chorus
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down
hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down
