stupid on the steinway
so sick upon a steinway
the sailors drown

see them talk and see them drown
and see them drink and fall around
upon the floor

chorus
sister of mine home again
sister of mine home again

verse 2
lonely in a crowded room
the radio plays out of tune
so silently

the radio upon the floor
is stupid it plays aznavour
so out of key

chorus

verse 3
broken on a ship of fools
even dreams must fall to rules
so stupidly
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likewords are all just useless sound
just like cards they fall around
and we will be

chorus

verse 4
buy a car and watch it rust
sister see them fall to dust
they fall around

in another crowded room
paint me like the shirt im in
honestly

chorus

outro
sister of mine
sister of mine
sister of mine
sister of mine
