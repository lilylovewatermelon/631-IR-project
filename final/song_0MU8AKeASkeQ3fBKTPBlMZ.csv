to the ends of this lost world
you have marched and you have sworn
to a tainted crown of thorns
as the hungry sails unfurl
we are thrusted from the shore
and its you that we search for

prechorus
the blackest night
the midnight sun
the covered tracks and days spent on the run
the strangers weve become

chorus
these whereabouts unknown
please know you can come home
its alright
i long for the moment
our silence is broken
its all right
its all right
its all right

verse 2
another place another time
we toed the same side of the line
yeah we saw eye to eye
even then the saddest sounds
were nothing laughter could not drown
but we are not laughing now
you might also likeprechorus
i see your face
in my sights
i hesitate
and then look for a sign
somewhere in the sky

chorus
these whereabouts unknown
please know you can come home
its alright
i long for the moment
our silence is broken
its all right
its all right
its all right

bridge
even together we stand apart
swallow the sun erase the sky
an invitation thats been declined
where did you go
where did you go

chorus
your whereabouts unknown
please know you can come home
its alright
i long for the moment
our silence is broken
its all right
its all right
its all right
outro
its alright now
its alright now
cause all is forgiven
if you could just listen
its all right
its all right1embed"
