theres a man looking blank to the wall
older colder and mumbling
looking over his shoulder
until the break of dawn
his eyes will not close
all the days are the same getting down
at the bar and hes mumbling
about the war and lost ones
until the break of dawn
and where are his loved ones

chorus
oh baby its oh so cold in this place
oh maybe its all so close to the bitter end
oh maybe it all just burns like a living hell
im all alone and here comes the dawn

verse 2
hearing boots walking into the bar
four men dragging their boxes
people stare and smell trouble
until the break of dawn the four men will go

chorus
oh baby its oh so cold in this place
oh maybe its all so close to the bitter end
oh maybe it all just burns like a living hell
im all alone and here comes the dawn
you might also likebridge
and the four men starts to open every case
and people wonder
when they pull out their instruments and play

refrain
dear people we are the guitar gangsters
and we are here to join you
and ease the pain youre in
now listen

verse 3
hearing boots walking out of the bar
four men dragging their boxes
people smile and theyre roaring
until the break of dawn a new day is born

chorus
oh baby its oh so cold in this place
oh maybe its all so close to the bitter end
oh maybe it all just burns like a living hell
im all alone and here comes the dawn

refrain
dear people we are the guitar gangsters
and we are here to join you
and ease the pain youre in
now listen
outro
dear ladies and gentlemen
we thank you for your kindness
were on the road again forever1embed"
