come out angels come out ghosts
come out darkness bring everyone you know
im not running and im not scared
i am waiting and well prepared

chorus
im in the war of my life
at the door of my life
out of time and theres nowhere to run

verse 2
i got a hammer and a heart of glass
i got to know right now which walls to smash
i got to pocket got no pills
if fear hasnt killed me yet then nothing will
all the suffering
and all the pain
never left a name

chorus
im in the war of my life
at the door of my life
out of time and theres nowhere to run
im in the war of my life
at the door of my life
out of time and theres nowhere to run

no more suffering
no more pain
never again

chorus
im in the war of my life
at the door of my life
out of time and theres nowhere to run
im in the war of my life
at the door of my life
out of time and theres nowhere to run

outro
so fight on i wont give up
fight on everyone i wont run
fight on got no choice but to fight until its done i wont stop for anyone
so fight on
so fight on i wont give up
fight on everyone i wont run
fight on got no choice but to fight until its done i wont stop for anyone
so fight onembed"
