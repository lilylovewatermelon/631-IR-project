winston was gelatinous with fatigue gelatinous was the right word it had come into his head spontaneously his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly but its translucency he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it all the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work leaving only a frail structure of nerves bones and skin all sensations seemed to be magnified his overalls fretted his shoulders the pavement tickled his feet even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak

he had worked more than ninety hours in five days so had everyone else in the ministry now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning he could spend six hours in the hiding place and another nine in his own bed slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr charringtons shop keeping one eye open for the patrols but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him the heavy brief case that he was carrying bumped against his knees at each step sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg inside it was the book which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened nor even looked at

on the sixth day of hate week after the processions the speeches the shouting the singing the banners the posters the films the waxworks the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes the booming of guns—after six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the two thousand eurasian war criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia oceania was at war with eastasia eurasia was an ally

there was of course no admission that any change had taken place merely it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit the square was packed with several thousand people including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spies on a scarletdraped platform an orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled was haranguing the crowd a little rumpelstiltskin figure contorted with hatred he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bony arm clawed the air menacingly above his head his voice made metallic by the amplifiers boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities massacres deportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombing of civilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions broken treaties it was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats the most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren the speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried onto the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speakers hand he unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech nothing altered in his voice or manner or in the content of what he was saying but suddenly the names were different without words said a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd oceania was at war with eastasia the next moment there was a tremendous commotion the banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong quite half of them had the wrong faces on them it was sabotage the agents of goldstein had been at work there was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot the spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys but within two or three minutes it was all over the orator still gripping the neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forward his free hand clawing at the air had gone straight on with his speech one minute more and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd the hate continued exactly as before except that the target had been changed

the thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but without even breaking the syntax but at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said excuse me i think youve dropped your brief case he took the brief case abstractedly without speaking he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth though the time was now nearly twentythree hours the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise the orders already issuing from the telescreens recalling them to their posts were hardly necessary

oceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at war with eastasia a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete reports and records of all kinds newspapers books pamphlets films sound tracks photographs—all had to be rectified at lightning speed although no directive was ever issued it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia or the alliance with eastasia should remain in existence anywhere the work was overwhelming all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the twentyfour with two threehour snatches of sleep mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors meals consisted of sandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work and each time that he crawled back stickyeyed and aching it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift half burying the speakwrite and overflowing onto the floor so that the first job was always to stack them into a neatenough pile to give him room to work what was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable

by the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes it was like struggling with some crushing physical task something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish in so far as he had time to remember it he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite every stroke of his ink pencil was a deliberate lie he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube then one more cylinder then nothing everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department a mighty deed which could never be mentioned had been achieved it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened at twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning winston still carrying the brief case containing the book which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept went home shaved himself and almost fell asleep in his bath although the water was barely more than tepid

with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above mr charringtons shop he was tired but not sleepy any longer he opened the window lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee julia would arrive presently meanwhile there was the book he sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief case

a heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the cover the print also looked slightly irregular the pages were worn at the edges and fell apart easily as though the book had passed through many hands the inscription on the title page ran

winston began reading

chapter 1

ignorance is strength

throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude toward one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society has never altered even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other

the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable

winston stopped reading chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading in comfort and safety he was alone no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand the sweet summer air played against his cheek from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock he settled deeper into the armchair and put his feet up on the fender it was bliss it was eternity suddenly as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and reread every word he opened it at a different place and found himself at the third chapter he went on reading

chapter 3

war is peace

the splittingup of the world into three great superstates was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states two of the three existing powers eurasia and oceania were already effectively in being the third eastasia only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting the frontiers between the three superstates are in some places arbitrary and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war but in general they follow geographical lines eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic landmass from portugal to the bering strait oceania comprises the americas the atlantic islands including the british isles australasia and the southern portion of africa eastasia smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier comprises china and the countries to the south of it the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria mongolia and tibet

in one combination or another these three superstates are permanently at war and have been so for the past twentyfive years war however is no longer the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference this is not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude toward it has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous on the contrary war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries and such acts as raping looting the slaughter of children the reduction of whole populations to slavery and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive are looked upon as normal and when they are committed by ones own side and not by the enemy meritorious but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people mostly highly trained specialists and causes comparatively few casualties the fighting when there is any takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes in the centers of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths war has in fact changed its character more exactly the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon

to understand the nature of the present war—for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years it is always the same war—one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive none of the three superstates could be definitely conquered even by the other two in combination they are too evenly matched and their natural defenses are too formidable eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants secondly there is no longer in a material sense anything to fight about with the establishment of selfcontained economies in which production and consumption are geared to one another the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death in any case each of the three superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose it is a war for labor power between the frontiers of the superstates and not permanently in the possession of any of them there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier brazzaville darwin and hong kong containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth it is for the possession of these thickly populated regions and of the northern ice cap that the three powers are constantly struggling in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area portions of it are constantly changing hands and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment

all of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labor whichever power controls equatorial africa or the countries of the middle east or southern india or the indonesian archipelago disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of illpaid and hardworking coolies the inhabitants of these areas reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments to capture more territory to control more labor power to turn out more armaments to capture more territory and so on indefinitely it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the mediterranean the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by oceania or by eastasia in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stable round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored but the balance of power always remains roughly even and the territory which forms the heartland of each superstate always remains inviolate moreover the labor of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the worlds economy they add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war by their labor the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up but if they did not exist the structure of world society and the process by which it maintains itself would not be essentially different

the primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principles of doublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society at present when few human beings even have enough to eat this problem is obviously not urgent and it might not have become so even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work the world of today is a bare hungry dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914 and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward in the early twentieth century the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snowwhite concrete—was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing this failed to happen partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought which could not survive in a strictly regimented society as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago certain backward areas have advanced and various devices always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage have been developed but experiment and invention have largely stopped and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteenfifties have never been fully repaired nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality had disappeared if the machine were used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminated within a few generations and in fact without being used for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process—by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute—the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries
but it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened the destruction—indeed in some sense was the destruction—of a hierarchical society in a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough to eat lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motorcar or even an airplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared if it once became general wealth would confer no distinction it was possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste but in practice such a society could not long remain stable for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves and when once they had done this they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away in the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance to return to the agricultural past as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not a practicable solution it conflicted with the tendency toward mechanization which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals

nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940 the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capital equipment was not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity but this too entailed military weakness and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world goods must be produced but they must not be distributed and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare

the essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of the products of human labor war is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labor power without producing anything that can be consumed a floating fortress for example has locked up in it the labor that would build several hundred cargo ships ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labors another floating fortress is built in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life but this is looked on as an advantage it is deliberate policy to keep even the favored groups somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another by the standards of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austere laborious kind of life nevertheless the few luxuries that he does enjoy—his large wellappointed flat the better texture of his clothes the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two or three servants his private motorcar or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the outer party and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call the proles the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty and at the same time the consciousness of being at war and therefore in danger makes the handingover of all power to a small caste seem the natural unavoidable condition of survival

war it will be seen not only accomplishes the necessary destruction but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labor of the world by building temples and pyramids by digging holes and filling them up again or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society what is concerned here is not the morale of the masses whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work but the morale of the party itself even the humblest party member is expected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war it does not matter whether the war is actually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly all that is needed is that a state of war should exist the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higher up the ranks one goes the more marked it becomes it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest in his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world

all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon the search for new weapons continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet in oceania at the present day science in the old sense has almost ceased to exist in newspeak there is no word for science the empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards the fields are cultivated with horse plows while books are written by machinery but in matters of vital importance—meaning in effect war and police espionage—the empirical approach is still encouraged or at least tolerated the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve one is how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand in so far as scientific research still continues this is its subject matter the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor studying with extraordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions gestures and tones of voice and testing the truthproducing effects of drugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he is a chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests or in the australian desert or on lost islands of the antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars others devise larger and larger rocket bombs more and more powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armorplating others search for new and deadlier gases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an airplane as independent of its base as a sailing ship others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the suns rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometers away in space or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earths center

but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none of the three superstates ever gains a significant lead on the others what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover although the party according to its habit claims the invention for itself atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteenforties and were first used on a large scale about ten years later at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centers chiefly in european russia western europe and north america the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society and hence of their own power thereafter although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombing planes have been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress but otherwise there has been little development the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens the desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks have never been repeated

none of the three superstates ever attempts any maneuver which involves the risk of serious defeat when any large operation is undertaken it is usually a surprise attack against an ally the strategy that all three powers are following or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and welltimed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots finally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world power in preparation for another attack this scheme it is hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization moreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isles which are geographically part of europe or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula but this would violate the principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the oceanic level the problem is the same for all three superstates it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisoners and colored slaves even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs

under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood and acted upon namely that the conditions of life in all three superstates are very much the same in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc in eurasia it is called neobolshevism and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as deathworship but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship of a semidivine leader the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare it follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doing so on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like three sheaves of corn and as usual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing their lives are dedicated to world conquest but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character

in past ages a war almost by definition was something that sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat in the past also war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency so long as defeat meant the loss of independence or some other result generally held to be undesirable the precautions against defeat had to be serious physical facts could not be ignored in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but when one was designing a gun or an airplane they had to make four inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions moreover to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past newspapers and history books were of course always colored and biased but falsification of the kind that is practiced today would have been impossible war was a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards while wars could be won or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsible

but when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerous when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded as we have seen researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their failure to show results is not important efficiency even military efficiency is no longer needed nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police since each of the three superstates is unconquerable each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practiced reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life—the need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of topstory windows and the like between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still a distinction but that is all cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down the rulers of such a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals but once that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose

the war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is merely an imposture it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another but though it is unreal it is not meaningless it eats up the surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs war it will be seen is now a purely internal affair in the past the ruling groups of all countries although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war did fight against one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of society intact the very word war therefore has become misleading it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different the effect would be much the same if the three superstates instead of fighting one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundaries for in that case each would still be a selfcontained universe freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war this—although the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning of the party slogan war is peace

winston stopped reading for a moment somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book in a room with no telescreen had not worn off solitude and safety were physical sensations mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek the book fascinated him or more exactly it reassured him in a sense it told him nothing that was new but that was part of the attraction it said what he would have said if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order it was the product of a mind similar to his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fearridden the best books he perceived are those that tell you what you know already he had just turned back to chapter 1 when he heard julias footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her she dumped her brown tool bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms it was more than a week since they had seen one another

ive got the book he said as they disentangled themselves
oh youve got it good she said without much interest and almost immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coffee

they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones the brawny redarmed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep he reached out for the book which was lying on the floor and sat up against the bedhead

we must read it he said you too all members of the brotherhood have to read it

you read it she said with her eyes shut read it aloud thats the best way then you can explain it to me as you go

the clocks hands said six meaning eighteen they had three or four hours ahead of them he propped the book against his knees and began reading

chapter 1

ignorance is strength

throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude toward one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society has never altered even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other

julia are you awake said winston

yes my love im listening go on its marvelous

the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable the aim of the high is to remain where they are the aim of the middle is to change places with the high the aim of the low when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again for long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently or both they are then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice as soon as they have reached their objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle begins over again of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind even today in a period of decline the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago but no advance in wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer from the point of view of the low no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters

by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers there then arose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life this doctrine of course had always had its adherents but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave the middle so long as it was struggling for power had always made use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity now however the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand socialism a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century ingsoc in oceania neobolshevism in eurasia deathworship as it is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality these new movements of course grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lipservice to their ideology but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more and then stop as usual the high were to be turned out by the middle who would then become the high but this time by conscious strategy the high would be able to maintain their position permanently

the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligible then it was alterable but the principal underlying cause was that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality had become technically possible it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favored some individuals against others but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth in earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable inequality was the price of civilization with the development of machine production however the case was altered even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels therefore from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe in it the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute labor had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historic change the heirs of the french english and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and had even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable every new political theory by whatever name it called itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930 practices which had been long abandoned in some cases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial the use of war prisoners as slaves public executions torture to extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations—not only became common again but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive

it was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully workedout political theories but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems generally called totalitarian which had appeared earlier in the century and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientists technicians tradeunion organizers publicity experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politicians these people whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition this last difference was cardinal by comparison with that existing today all the tyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance the invention of print however made it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carried the process further with the development of television and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching could be kept for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channels of communication closed the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects now existed for the first time

after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties society regrouped itself as always into high middle and low but the new high group unlike all its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly the socalled abolition of private property which took place in the middle years of the century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before but with this difference that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals individually no member of the party owns anything except petty personal belongings collectively the party owns everything in oceania because it controls everything and disposes of the products as it thinks fit in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated socialism must follow and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated factories mines land houses transport—everything had been taken away from them and since these things were no longer private property it followed that they must be public property ingsoc which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited its phraseology has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist program with the result foreseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been made permanent

but the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power either it is conquered from without or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being or it loses its own selfconfidence and willingness to govern these causes do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself

after the middle of the present century the first danger had in reality disappeared each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert the second danger also is only a theoretical one the masses never revolt of their own accord and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed indeed so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison they never even become aware that they are oppressed the recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate as for the problem of overproduction which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique it is solved by the device of continuous warfare see chapter 3 which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch from the point of view of our present rulers therefore the only genuine dangers are the splittingoff of a new group of able underemployed powerhungry people and the growth of liberalism and skepticism in their own ranks the problem that is to say is educational it is a problem of continuously molding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way

given this background one could infer if one did not know it already the general structure of oceanic society at the apex of the pyramid comes big brother big brother is infallible and allpowerful every success every achievement every victory every scientific discovery all knowledge all wisdom all happiness all virtue are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration nobody has ever seen big brother he is a face on the hoardings a voice on the telescreen we may be reasonably sure that he will never die and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world his function is to act as a focusing point for love fear and reverence emotions which are more easily felt toward an individual than toward an organization below big brother comes the inner party its numbers limited to six millions or something less than two per cent of the population of oceania below the inner party comes the outer party which if the inner party is described as the brain of the state may be justly likened to the hands below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as the proles numbering perhaps eightyfive per cent of the population in the terms of our earlier classification the proles are the low for the slave populations of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure

in principle membership in these three groups is not hereditary the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party admission to either branch of the party is by examination taken at the age of sixteen nor is there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another jews negroes south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital oceania has no capital and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language it is not centralized in any way its rulers are not held together by blood ties but by adherence to a common doctrine it is true that our society is stratified and very rigidly stratified on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines there is far less toandfro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the preindustrial ages between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to rise proletarians in practice are not allowed to graduate into the party the most gifted among them who might possibly become nuclei of discontent are simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it a matter of principle the party is not a class in the old sense of the word it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children as such and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat in the crucial years the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition the older kind of socialist who had been trained to fight against something called class privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years the essence of oligarchical rule is not fathertoson inheritance but the persistence of a certain worldview and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself who wields power is not important provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same

all the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of presentday society from being perceived physical rebellion or any preliminary move toward rebellion is at present not possible from the proletarians nothing is to be feared left to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and dying not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important the level of popular education is actually declining what opinions the masses hold or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indifference they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect in a party member on the other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated

a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone wherever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in his bath or in bed he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected nothing that he does is indifferent his friendships his relaxations his behavior toward his wife and children the expression of his face when he is alone the words he mutters in sleep even the characteristic movements of his body are all jealously scrutinized not only any actual misdemeanor but any eccentricity however small any change of habits any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle is certain to be detected he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behavior in oceania there is no law thoughts and actions which when detected mean certain death are not formally forbidden and the endless purges arrests tortures imprisonments and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the wipingout of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future a party member is required to have not only the right opinions but the right instincts many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc if he is a person naturally orthodox in newspeak a goodthinker he will in all circumstances know without taking thought what is the true belief or the desirable emotion but in any case an elaborate mental training undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop blackwhite and doublethink makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever

a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors triumph over victories and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the party the discontents produced by his bare unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate and the speculations which might possibly induce a skeptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline the first and simplest stage in the discipline which can be taught even to young children is called in newspeak crimestop crimestop means the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought it includes the power of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction crimestop in short means protective stupidity but stupidity is not enough on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over ones own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is need for an unwearying momenttomoment flexibility in the treatment of facts the key word here is blackwhite like so many newspeak words this word has two mutually contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain facts applied to a party member it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this but it means also the ability to believe that black is white and more to know that black is white and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary this demands a continuous alteration of the past made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest and which is known in newspeak as doublethink

the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which is subsidiary and so to speak precautionary the subsidiary reason is that the party member like the proletarian tolerates presentday conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison he must be cut off from the past just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party it is not merely that speeches statistics and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted for to change ones mind or even ones policy is a confession of weakness if for example eurasia or eastasia whichever it may be is the enemy today then that country must always have been the enemy and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered thus history is continuously rewritten this daytoday falsification of the past carried out by the ministry of truth is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love

the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc past events it is argued have no objective existence but survive only in written records and in human memories the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it it also follows that though the past is alterable it never has been altered in any specific instance for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment then this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed this holds good even when as often happens the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner and if it is necessary to rearrange ones memories or to tamper with written records then it is necessary to forget that one has done so the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique it is learned by the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox in oldspeak it is called quite frankly reality control in newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethink comprises much else as well

doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in ones mind simultaneously and accepting both of them the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated the process has to be conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision but it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able—and may for all we know continue to be able for thousands of years—to arrest the course of history

all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft either they became stupid and arrogant failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown or they became liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should have used force and once again were overthrown they fell that is to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent if one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in ones own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes

it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating in our society those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion the more intelligent the less sane one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale those whose attitude toward the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones the slightly more favored workers whom we call the proles are only intermittently conscious of the war when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening it is in the ranks of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm is found worldconquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible this peculiar linkingtogether of opposites—knowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society the official ideology abounds with contradictions even where there is no practical reason for them thus the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation these contradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in doublethink for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken if human equality is to be forever averted—if the high as we have called them are to keep their places permanently—then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity

but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored it is why should human equality be averted supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described what is the motive for this huge accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time

here we reach the central secret as we have seen the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies the original motive the neverquestioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink the thought police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards this motive really consists 

winston became aware of silence as one becomes aware of a new sound it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past she was lying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly

julia

no answer

julia are you awake

no answer she was asleep he shut the book put it carefully on the floor lay down and pulled the coverlet over both of them

he had still he reflected not learned the ultimate secret he understood how he did not understand why chapter 1 like chapter 3 had not actually told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad being in a minority even a minority of one did not make you mad there was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world you were not mad a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow he shut his eyes the sun on his face and the girls smooth body touching his own gave him a strong sleepy confident feeling he was safe everything was all right he fell asleep murmuring sanity is not statistical with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdomembed"
