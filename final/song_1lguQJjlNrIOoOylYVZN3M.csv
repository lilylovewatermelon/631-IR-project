verse 1
when the leader of the bad guys sang
something soft and soaked in pain
i heard the echo from his secret hideaway
he mustve forgot to close his door
as he cranked out those dismal chords
and his four walls declared him insane

prechorus
i found my way right time wrong place
as i pled my case

chorus
youre the judge oh no
set me free
youre the judge oh no
set me free
i know my souls freezing
hells hot for good reason
so please take me

verse 2
three lights are lit but the fourth ones out
i can tell cause its a bit darker than the last nights bout
i forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
so i head out down a route i think is heading south
but im not good with directions and i hide behind my mouth
im a pro at imperfections and im best friends with my doubt
and now that my minds out and now i hear it clear and loud
im thinking wow i probably shouldve stayed inside my house

prechorus
i found my way right time wrong place
as i pled my case

chorus
youre the judge oh no
set me free
youre the judge oh no
set me free
i know my souls freezing
hells hot for good reason
so please
