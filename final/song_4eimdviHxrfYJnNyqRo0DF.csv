verse 1
like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
a scary conversation shut my eyes cant find the brake
what if they say that youre a climber
naturally im worried if i do it alone
who really cares cause its your life
you never know it could be great
take a chance cause you might grow
oh ohoh

chorus
what you waiting what you waiting
what you waiting what you waiting
what you waiting for
what you waiting what you waiting
what you waiting what you waiting
what you waiting for

verse 2
like an echo pedal youre repeating yourself
you know it all by heart why are you standing in one place uhhuh

life is short youre capable uhhuh
