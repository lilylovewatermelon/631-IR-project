i always needed time on my own
i never thought id need you there when i cried
and the days feel like years when im alone
and the bed where you lie is made up on your side

prechorus
when you walk away
i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now

chorus
when youre gone
the pieces of my heart are missin you
when youre gone
the face i came to know is missin too
when youre gone the words i need to hear
to always get me through the day
and make it okay
i miss you

verse 2
ive never felt this way before
everything that i do reminds me of you
and the clothes you left they lie on the floor
and they smell just like you
i love the things that you do
