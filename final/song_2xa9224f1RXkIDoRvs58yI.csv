chorus
baby i could give you the moon

girl i think im dyin real soon
we could die in my room me and you
baby i could give you the moon
you know he cant do what i do yeah its true
girl i think im dyin real soon
we could die in my room me and you

verse
ima keep you in mind while i drive right by
say goodbye to the nice guy im wastin my time
givin you rhymes you gotta give me a dime
before i do that again
and i aint trippin im high
in the trunk of the benz is where my women reside
where my women will die
i aint got no friends and i dont listen to yall
im equipped for the fall
and the winter and all oh
when the summer come
ima have enough to get the fuck out
i could buy a truck and drive that motherfuckin truck out skrr
tryna buy luck if you dont die that means you lucked out
i aint tryna fuck i see the moon and bug the fuck out
