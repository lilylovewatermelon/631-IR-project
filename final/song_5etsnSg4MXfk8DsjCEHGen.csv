premeditation will kill the trust
theyll never know if you fear me
with every second collecting dust
i feel so bloated and weary
because she belongs to heaven

chorus
shes coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
burn

verse 2
shell cut you down with a single thrust
shes taken over too quickly
no medication can cure the lust
so say a prayer for the sickly
because she belongs to heaven

chorus
shes coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
as before

chorus
shes coming over like a suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
another overbearing suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip

chorus
shes coming over wearing genocide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
another complicating suicide
and its the same old trip
the same old trip as before
as before5embed"
