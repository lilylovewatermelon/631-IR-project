blood dripping off my braids
persuade em with the blade
bitch i call a spade a spade
there aint no need for throwing shade
you know i keep that contraband
uicide in high demand
keep a hand full of them xans and a fully loaded mag
afterlife pimpin got them rims on a casket
bitches on my mattress fuck em all backwards
walking corpse stalking courts
show em no remorse
corner store sippin fours
fresh up off a tour bitch

verse 2 ruby da cherry
tulip flower petals shower me in slow motion
while im blowing on some sour d
fuck an idol no one towers over me
hopefully openly talking bout all of my emotions
ocean deep sink into the bottom
opening up all my fucking problems
bitch i promise ill become forgotten rotten
fucking spotted on the concrete
six times three
if i was a key on the board id probably be delete or escape
either way youre pressing me uhsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like13embed"
