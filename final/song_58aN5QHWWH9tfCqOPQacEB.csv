ive got my share of scars on those ol monkey bars
every time id hit the ground
on that old long dirt my bike lost control
and once again i was fallin down
every time id try to fly theres a force i cant deny
gravity
grew to be six foot one depended on no one
yeah i was my ol man
invincible and strong until you came along
and touched me with your gentle hand
when i look into your eyes theres a force i cant deny
gravity
