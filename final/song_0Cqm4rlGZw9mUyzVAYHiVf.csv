we painted our faces
we were a resting place for the light
i must admit an arresting sight
we looked alright
but now its just traces
as we fade in black and white
we put makeup on with no light
were too uptight

chorus
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down

verse 2
to show my true colors
i must first be exposed to the light
i trust first and secondly fight
with all my might
ive blown my cover
in plain view im as plain as you
but you cant deny my hues

color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
