blank stares faithless
vampires at the same places
shadows traces
i know that you feel me

refrain
youre runnin’ runnin runnin runnin’
making the rounds with all your fake friends
runnin runnin away from it
you can strip down without showing skin yeah

prechorus
i can see youre scared of your emotions
i can see youre hoping youre not hopeless
so why cant you show me
why cant you show me
i can see you’re looking for distractions
i can see you’re tired of the acting
so why cant you show me

chorus
