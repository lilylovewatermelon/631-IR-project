you call me
oh you call me all the time
you tell me
ooh baby yeah youre mine
i like it
when you draw me all these smiles
i like it
but its so its so many miles

chorus
i cant take just a fictional you
its making me sad
cant take just a picture of you
its making me mad
i know its a weekend or two
that i cant get past

verse 2
i draw you
oh i draw you in my mind
adore you
and your imaginary eyes
i saw you
but the details i can’t find
adore you
but it’s starting to blur the lines
