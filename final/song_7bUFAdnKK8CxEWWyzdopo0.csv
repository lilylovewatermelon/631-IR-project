fuck it

verse 1 jason butler vic fuentes
well dont you say that had a part of it
guess well never know
oh would you say that had a part of it
well i guess well never know
constant recovery
i see you choke and it takes my breath away
when all is good we close our eyes

prechorus vic fuentes  jason butler
they all accept the lie
so bury what you are outside
brother promise you wont leave me

chorus vic fuentes
i know youre tortured within
your eyes look hungry again
but ill never wander my friend

verse 2 vic fuentes jason butler
will somebody believe in this suicide
am i the only one that thinks that you should stay alive
oh i became the shame as you backed up on the ropes
to arm yourself and hide
so i scream mayday im in trouble
send somebody on the double
scratching at the floor inside my mind
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus vic fuentes  jason butler

i let you down
and i started to run
never meant to be your pain

show me it show me the way back
show me the way back
show me the way back home

chorus vic fuentes jason butler
i know youre tortured within
your eyes look hungry again
but ill never wander my friend

just to make it through the day
