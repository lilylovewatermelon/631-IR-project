every day i clock out
and head straight to her house
we cuddle up on the couch
but it always ends the same ole way
im driving home and its incredibly late
somethings got to change because

chorus
ive been wrapped around her finger
since the first time we went out
every day and every night shes all i think about
i need that girl beside me
when the lights go out
i think its time to put a ring on the finger
im wrapped around

verse 2
went to the bank took out a loan
went and bought the perfect stone
called up her dad on the phone
im talking him to dinner sunday night
ive never been so nervous in my life
i want to do this right because

chorus
ive been wrapped around her finger
since the first time we went out
every day and every night shes all i think about
i need that girl beside me
when the lights go out
i think its time to put a ring on the finger
im wrapped around

since the first time we went out
