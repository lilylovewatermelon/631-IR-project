youre the one that i adore you
give me one and donâ€™t adore me
tell me things you all believe i do
all the things i wanna say and
tell the things you are to me and
all the lies you have to say i do
ooh ooh ooh baby
yesterday was when i felt down
and you came with my stuff and put fate on the ground
and you have to say that you looked at me
obviously i do
thats why i want to be

to fly away just like a sparrow
the feel of letting my hair blow
to take my time wherever i go
i mean mine

verse 2
youre the one that i adore
just kiss me once i wanna know you
feel the vibe that i can feel in mine
if you are the one for me
just tell me twice and i will see
the heart and soul of all the things i feel
