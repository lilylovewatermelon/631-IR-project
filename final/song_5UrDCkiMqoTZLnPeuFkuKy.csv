run to your dreaming when youre alone
unplug the tv and turn off your phone
get heavy on with digging your ditch

chorus
because im digging a ditch where madness gives a bit
digging a ditch where silence lives
digging a ditch for when im old
digging a ditch my storys told
where all these troubles weigh down on me will rise
run to your dreaming when youre alone
where all these questions spinning round my head will die

verse 2
run to your dreaming when youre alone
unplug the tv and turn off your phone
get heavy on with digging your ditch

chorus
digging a ditch where madness gives a bit
digging a ditch where silence lives
digging a ditch for when im through
digging this ditch im digging for you
where all these worries wear down on me will rise
where all these habits pull heavy at my heart will die

run to your dreaming when youre alone
not what you should be or what youve become
just get heavy on with digging your ditch

chorus
digging a ditch where madness gives a bit
digging a itch where silence lives
where all these disappointments that grow angry out of me will rise
will die will die will die

verse 4
run to your dreaming when youre alone
unplug the tv and turn off your phone
get heavy on with digging your ditch1embed"
