last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and im still reaching
even though i know youre not there
i was playing back a thousand memories baby
thinking bout everything weve been through
maybe ive been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you

chorus
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside til i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said youre sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie youd be here by now

verse 2
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin
cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
that nothings gonna change not for me and you
back before i knew how much i had to lose

come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside til i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said youre sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie youd be here by now

bridge
if youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on
ive been waiting for you every day since youve been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just wanna see you back at my front door

breakdown
and i say come back come back come back to me like
you would before you said its not that easy
before the fight before i locked you out
but i take it all back now

chorus
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside til i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said youre sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie youd be here by now
outro
youd be here by now
its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
baby what about the ending
oh i thought youd be here by now
oh oh oh oh oh oh
thought youd be here by now22embed"
