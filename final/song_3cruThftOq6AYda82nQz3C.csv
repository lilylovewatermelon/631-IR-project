verse 1 big boi
did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block
didnt have to break a steering column didnt have to cook a rock
a damn goodie twoshoes that what they call you ugh
never judge a person or a book by its covers yeah
just because my tone is darker than yours a little tanner
you never took the time out examine yourself boy
are you black white asian
indonesian or borean—thats black and korean
we on the same team if we breathing
i jumped off the subject to see if you was seeing
that we drop a little science off in every verse
they put that pa sticker on it cause they scared we gon curse
but the knowledge is the power power
the cowards get devoured
any hour any cipher any way to any height ugh
because i might just snap on a fuckass nigga bitch
might clap a cap at a suckerass nigga
in the meantime daddy fat sax gon chill out
he might just pull out his pistol
and let that thing whistle at your windshield or your residence
superman to clark kents you better be way harder
than the park bench to start this
marcus jason my little brother james—
all my brothers from my mama but andre is just the same ooh
aint no uno we a duo deuce dos two a pair
a player stiffen the competition
pressed like levis and tuffskins
one minus one negative one minus negative one is nothing ugh
busting dboy raps and player poems
the kast shit aint plastic we smash it and move the crowd
and rock the crowd original material while you bore em
your live show consists of everybodys shit but your own
do your own shit in your live show bitingass nigga

verse 2 big boi
penelope ann cruz couldnt snooze
with her eyes wide shut before i asked to hit her gut
if you brunette legally blonde i might respond
take you to swan lake and beyond
antwan raps on raps on
clapoff clapon
i switch the flow so quick you cannot fathom
i take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
and try to grab one line or sentence
rhyme repentance find the illest lyricist
and give him a clean bill of health
wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
and your team looking shitty to death

verse 3 killer mike  big boi
my nigga big boi said
watch em as they gawk and they gander
you can follow or lead like commander picard
you can have the whole world
or be satisfied with the boulevard overstand
this young players line
i foregoed the crime and i focused on rhyme
focused on every word and line
like a young cassius clay in his prime
i was born to talk shit and prove mine and im
the epitome of raw rhyme
got signed got serious about the craft
of raw rhyme and i got mine—aqueminis
murderous monster move minds
spit it so hard that it oughta be a crime
when you see im coming holler one time holler one time
when you see im coming holler one time onetime
