youve applied the pressure
to have me crystalised
and youve got the faith
that i could bring paradise

verse 2 romy
ill forgive and forget
before im paralysed
do i have to keep up the pace
to keep you satisfied

prechorus oliver  both
things have gotten closer to the sun
and ive done things in small doses
so dont think that im pushing you away
when youre the one that ive kept closest

chorus both
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh

verse 3 romy
you dont move slow
taking steps in my direction
the sound resounds echo
does it lessen your affection no
you might also likeverse 4 oliver
you say im foolish
for pushing this aside
but burn down our home
i wont leave alive

prechorus romy  both
glaciers have melted to the sea
i wish the tide would take me over
ive been down on my knees
and you just keep on getting closer

chorus romy  oliver
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh

bridge romy  oliver
glaciers have melted to the sea
things have gotten closer to the sun
i wish the tide would take me over
and ive done things in small doses
ive been down onto my knees
so dont think that im pushing you away
and you just keep on getting closer
when youre the one that ive kept closest
outro romy  oliver
go slow
go slow
go slow
go slow
go slow
