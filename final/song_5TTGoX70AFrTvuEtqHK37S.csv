one two three four

verse 1
so youre on the prowl wondering whether
she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like antenna
never knowin when to stop
sunglasses indoors
par for the course
lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

verse 2
call off the search for your soul
or put it on hold again
shes having a sly indoor smoke
and she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
sippin her drink and laughin at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going

chorus
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
number one party anthem

shes a certified mind blower
knowing full well that i know
may suggest theres somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues confused because
its not like im falling in love i just want you
to do me no good
and you look like you could

chorus
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
number one party anthem
come on come on come on
before the moments gone
number one party anthem yeah yeah

bridge
the look of love the rush of blood
the shes with mes the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs the camera plus
the black  white and the colour dodge
the good time girls the cubicles
the house of fun the number one
party anthem oh
chorus
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
come on come on come on
before the moments gone
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
