hey dont miss out on what youre passing
youre missing the hootah of the funky buddha
eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
so come on as i start to kick it
cause were like the outlaws striding suckers are hiding
jump behind the bush when they see me driving by
hanging out my window
and my magnum taking out some putos
acting kinda loco im just another local kid
from the street getting paid for my vocals
here is something you cant understand
how i could just kill a man

chorus
here is something you cant understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you cant understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you cant understand
how i could just kill a man
here is something you cant understand

verse 2
ive been doin all the dumb shit yo because nothin is coming from it
im not gonna waste no time fucking around i got ya humming
hummin comin at ya
then you know i had to gat ya
time for some action just a fraction of friction uh
i got the clearance to run the interference
into your satellite shining a battle light
swing out the gat and i know that well gat you right
heres an example just a little sample
how i could just kill a man
one time tried to come in my home
take my chrome i said yo its on
take cover son or youre assed out
howd you like my chrome then i watched the rookie pass out
didnt have to blast him but i did anyway
hahahahaha young punk had to pay
so i just killed the man

bridge
its gonna be a long time before i finish
one of the many missions that i have to establish
to light my spliff ignite you with insights and
if you aint down bullshit

verse 3
say some punk tried to get you for your auto
would you call the one time and play the role model
no i think youll play like a thug
next hear the shot of a magnum slug
humming coming at ya
yeah you know im gonna gat ya
how do you know where im at
when you havent been where ive been
understand where im coming from
when youre up on the hill in your big home
im out here risking my dome
just for a bucket or a fast ducat
just to stay alive yo i gotta say fuck it
