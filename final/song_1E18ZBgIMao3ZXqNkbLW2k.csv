girl look at you right there with that wind in your hair
like a dream in the sunset light
i couldnt love you any more i couldnt love you any less
i guess im doing something right
but girl you got to promise me
that if you ever have to leave

chorus
baby lie to me because i couldnt stand the truth
and i couldnt bear the thought of losing you
baby lie to me tell me everythings all right
and when im sound asleep you can fade into the night
girl instead of saying goodbye
just lie to me

verse 2
last night when i saw you in a dream you were packing your things
and baby it all seemed so real
you came to tell me you were gone my life had ended like a song
felt as bad as i could feel
so if there ever comes a day
that you want to walk away

chorus

baby just lie to me because i could not stand the truth
and i couldnt beat the thought of losing you
baby lie to me tell me everything is cool
because knowing you were leaving girl that would be so cruel
girl instead of saying goodbye
just smile and look me right in the eye
yeah girl instead of watching me cry
just lie to me oh yeah
baby lie to meembed"
