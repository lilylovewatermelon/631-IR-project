what happened to you
you played the victim for so long now in this game
what i thought was true
is made of fiction and im following the same
but if i try to make sense of this mess im in
im not sure where i should begin
im falling
im falling

chorus 1
now im in over my head
for something i said
completely misread im better off dead
and now i can see how fake you can be
this hypocrisys beginning to get to me

verse 2
its none of my concern
dont look to me cause i dont believe in fame
i guess you never heard
i met our makers they dont even know your name
but if i had to say goodbye to leave this hell
id say my time has served me well
im falling
im falling

and now im in over my head
with something i said completely misread im better off dead
and now i cant see how fake you can be
this hypocrisys beginning to get to

verse 3
this came long before those who suffer more
im too awake for this to be a nightmare
whats with my disgrace ive lost the human race
no one plans for it to blow up in their face

bridge
who said it was easy to put back all these pieces
who said it was so easy to put back all these pieces

chorus 1
now im in over my head
for something i said
completely misread im better off dead
and now i can see how fake you can be
this hypocrisys beginning to get to me

over my head
better off dead
