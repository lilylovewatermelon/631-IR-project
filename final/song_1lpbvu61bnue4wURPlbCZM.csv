dont sweat
take a bow
dont fret
its over now
overflow
shake a fist
howling at
the emptiness

chorus
felt something
starts to burn
fades away
the wind it turns
ashes flow
moon is glow
run away
forget the day

verse 2
down and out
nothings doubts
lets get
the molting out
make a space
set it free
tug or pull
they will see
you might also likechorus
felt something
starts to burn
fades away
the wind it turns
ashes flow
moon is glow
run away
forget the day
forget the day forget the day forget the day forget the day forget the dayembed"
