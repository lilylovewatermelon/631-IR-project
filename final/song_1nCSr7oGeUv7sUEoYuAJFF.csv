remember when i was young and so were you
and time stood still and love was all we knew
you were the first so was i
we made love and then you cried
remember when

verse 2
remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
gave our hearts made the start it was hard
we lived and learned life threw curves
there was joy there was hurt
remember when

verse 3
remember when old ones died and new were born
and life was changed disassembled rearranged
we came together fell apart
and broke each others hearts
remember when

verse 4
remember when the sound of little feet
was the music
we danced to week to week
brought back the love we found trust
vowed wed never give it up
remember when

remember when thirty seemed so old

to where we are where weve been

remember when we said when we turned gray
when the children grow up and move away
we wont be sad well be glad
for all the life weve had
and well remember when
