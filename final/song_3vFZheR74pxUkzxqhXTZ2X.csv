juno was mad he knew hed been had
so he shot at the sun with a gun
shot at the sun with a gun
shot at his wily one only friend

verse 1
in the gallows or the ghetto ahh
in the town or the meadow
in the billows even over the sun ahh
every end of the time is another begun

chorus
you understand mechanical hands are the ruler of everything ah
the ruler of everything ah
im the ruler of everything in the end
mih teg yawa gninnur s’eh tibbarkcaj a s’eh oh oh oh oh oh ho

verse 2 man zubin  time joe
do you like how i dance ive got zirconium pants
consequential enough to slip you into a trance
do you like how i walk do you like how i talk
do you like how my face disintegrates into chalk
i have a wonderful wife i have a powerful job
she criticizes me for being egocentric hahahaha
you practice your mannerisms into the wall
if this mirror were clearer id be standing so tall
i saw you slobber over clovers on the side of the hill
i was observing the birds circle in for the kill
ive been you i know you your façade is a scam
you know youre making me cry this is the way that i am
ive been living a lie a metamorphical scheme
detective undercover brotherhood objective obscene
oh no no oh yeah

do you hear the flibbity jibbity jibber jabber
with an oh my god ive got to get out of here or ill have another
word to sell another story to tell
another timepiece ringing the bell
do you hear the clock stop when you reach the end
no you know it must be neverending comprehend if you can
but when you try to pretend to understand
you resemble a fool although youre only a man
so give it up and smile
do you hear the flibbity jibbity jibber jabber
with an oh my god ive got to get out of here or ill have another
word to sell another story to tell
another timepiece​ ringing the bell
do you hear the clock stop when you reach the end
no you know it must be neverending comprehend if you can
but when you try to pretend to understand
you resemble a fool although youre only a man
so give it up and smile time time time time

chorus
you understand mechanical hands are the ruler of everything ah
the ruler of everything ah
im the ruler of everything in the end

outro
without looking down gliding around
like a bumbling dragon i fly
scraping my face on the sky
oh no no oh yeah44embed"
