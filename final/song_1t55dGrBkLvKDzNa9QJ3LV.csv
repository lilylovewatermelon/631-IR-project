verse 1 gunna
made it out the jungle i ball aint got no jumper
rest in peace to my uncle never met but i still love you
remember that pussy from way back playin i pay em to pop him
stayed in the hood where the killers at made my pillow a chopper
this aint diamonds you lookin at and we done updated the roster

trappin at school i was servin bags police was searchin my locker
who did your jewelry it look like brass one of your bros shouldve stopped ya

chorus gunna
its young wunna and young wheezy man this shit too easy
different bitch for every season showin me they cleavage
i take drugs and feel relaxed its like they therapeutic
she text that pussy i dont call back so she wont think i need it
