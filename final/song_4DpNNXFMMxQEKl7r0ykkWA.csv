you call me on the telephone you feel so far away
you tell me to come over theres some games you wanna play
im walkin to your house nobodys home
just me and you and you and me alone

prechorus
were just playin hide and seek
its gettin hard to breathe
under the sheets with you
i dont wanna play no games
im tired of always chasin
chasin after you

chorus
i dont give a fuck about you anyways
who ever said i give a shit bout you
you never share your toys or communicate
i guess im just a playdate to you
verse 2
wake up in your bedroom and theres nothin left to say
when i try to talk youre always playin board games
i wish i had monopoly over your mind
i wish i didnt care all the time
