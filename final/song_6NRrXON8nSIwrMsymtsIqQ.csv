im pulling my questions from my shelf
im asking forgiveness
i aint asking nobody but myself
and i want you to know this
and i want you to know this

verse 2
youre rifling through a bunch of toys
that were handed down to me
just take out the ones you want and then
give the rest to my family

im gonna go back to school today
but im dropping myself off
im throwing the childhood scenes away
im through ripping myself off
im done ripping myself off

verse 3
well im child and man and child again
the toy broken boy soldier
im child and man then child again
the boy never gets older
the boy never gets older
the boy never gets older
the boy never gets older
the boy never gets older
never gets older
