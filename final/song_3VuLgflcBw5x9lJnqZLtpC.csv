attend thou with eye and ear and make judgements straight with righteousness and i perses would tell of true things

ll 1124 so after all there was not one kind of strife alone but all over the earth there are two as for the one a man would praise her when he came to understand her but the other is blameworthy and they are wholly different in nature for one fosters evil war and battle being cruel her no man loves but perforce through the will of the deathless gods men pay harsh strife her honour due but the other is the elder daughter of dark night and the son of cronos who sits above and dwells in the aether set her in the roots of the earth and she is far kinder to men she stirs up even the shiftless to toil for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order and neighbour vies with is neighbour as he hurries after wealth this strife is wholesome for men and potter is angry with potter and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar and minstrel of minstrel

ll 2541 perses lay up these things in your heart and do not let that strife who delights in mischief hold your heart back from work while you peep and peer and listen to the wrangles of the courthouse little concern has he with quarrels and courts who has not a years victuals laid up betimes even that which the earth bears demeters grain when you have got plenty of that you can raise disputes and strive to get anothers goods but you shall have no second chance to deal so again nay let us settle our dispute here with true judgement divided our inheritance but you seized the greater share and carried it off greatly swelling the glory of our bribeswallowing lords who love to judge such a cause as this fools they know not how much more the half is than the whole nor what great advantage there is in mallow and asphodel 1

ll 4253 for the gods keep hidden from men the means of life else you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste but zeus in the anger of his heart hid it because prometheus the crafty deceived him therefore he planned sorrow and mischief against men he hid fire but that the noble son of iapetus stole again for men from zeus the counsellor in a hollow fennelstalk so that zeus who delights in thunder did not see it but afterwards zeus who gathers the clouds said to him in anger

ll 5459 son of iapetus surpassing all in cunning you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire  a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be but i will give men as the price for fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart while they embrace their own destruction

ll 6068 so said the father of men and gods and laughed aloud and he bade famous hephaestus make haste and mix earth with water and to put in it the voice and strength of human kind and fashion a sweet lovely maidenshape like to the immortal goddesses in face and athene to teach her needlework and the weaving of the varied web and golden aphrodite to shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs and he charged hermes the guide the slayer of argus to put in her a shameless mind and a deceitful nature

ll 6982 so he ordered and they obeyed the lord zeus the son of cronos forthwith the famous lame god moulded clay in the likeness of a modest maid as the son of cronos purposed and the goddess brighteyed athene girded and clothed her and the divine graces and queenly persuasion put necklaces of gold upon her and the richhaired hours crowned her head with spring flowers and pallas athene bedecked her form with all manners of finery also the guide the slayer of argus contrived within her lies and crafty words and a deceitful nature at the will of loud thundering zeus and the herald of the gods put speech in her and he called this woman pandora 2 because all they who dwelt on olympus gave each a gift a plague to men who eat bread

ll 8389 but when he had finished the sheer hopeless snare the father sent glorious argusslayer the swift messenger of the gods to take it to epimetheus as a gift and epimetheus did not think on what prometheus had said to him bidding him never take a gift of olympian zeus but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men but he took the gift and afterwards when the evil thing was already his he understood

ll 90105 for ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sickness which bring the fates upon men for in misery men grow old quickly but the woman took off the great lid of the jar 3 with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men only hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar and did not fly out at the door for ere that the lid of the jar stopped her by the will of aegisholding zeus who gathers the clouds but the rest countless plagues wander amongst men for earth is full of evils and the sea is full of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night bringing mischief to mortals silently for wise zeus took away speech from them so is there no way to escape the will of zeus

ll 106108 or if you will i will sum you up another tale well and skilfully  and do you lay it up in your heart  how the gods and mortal men sprang from one source

ll 109120 first of all the deathless gods who dwell on olympus made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of cronos when he was reigning in heaven and they lived like gods without sorrow of heart remote and free from toil and grief miserable age rested not on them but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils when they died it was as though they were overcome with sleep and they had all good things for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint they dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods

ll 121139 but after earth had covered this generation  they are called pure spirits dwelling on the earth and are kindly delivering from harm and guardians of mortal men for they roam everywhere over the earth clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds givers of wealth for this royal right also they received  then they who dwell on olympus made a second generation which was of silver and less noble by far it was like the golden race neither in body nor in spirit a child was brought up at his good mothers side an hundred years an utter simpleton playing childishly in his own home but when they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another nor would they serve the immortals nor sacrifice on the holy altars of the blessed ones as it is right for men to do wherever they dwell then zeus the son of cronos was angry and put them away because they would not give honour to the blessed gods who live on olympus

ll 140155 but when earth had covered this generation also  they are called blessed spirits of the underworld by men and though they are of second order yet honour attends them also  zeus the father made a third generation of mortal men a brazen race sprung from ashtrees 4 and it was in no way equal to the silver age but was terrible and strong they loved the lamentable works of ares and deeds of violence they ate no bread but were hard of heart like adamant fearful men great was their strength and unconquerable the arms which grew from their shoulders on their strong limbs their armour was of bronze and their houses of bronze and of bronze were their implements there was no black iron these were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the dank house of chill hades and left no name terrible though they were black death seized them and they left the bright light of the sun
ll 156169b but when earth had covered this generation also zeus the son of cronos made yet another the fourth upon the fruitful earth which was nobler and more righteous a godlike race of heromen who are called demigods the race before our own throughout the boundless earth grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them some in the land of cadmus at seven gated thebe when they fought for the flocks of oedipus and some when it had brought them in ships over the great sea gulf to troy for richhaired helens sake there deaths end enshrouded a part of them but to the others father zeus the son of cronos gave a living and an abode apart from men and made them dwell at the ends of earth and they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling ocean happy heroes for whom the graingiving earth bears honeysweet fruit flourishing thrice a year far from the deathless gods and cronos rules over them 5 for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds and these last equally have honour and glory

ll 169c169d and again farseeing zeus made yet another generation the fifth of men who are upon the bounteous earth

ll 170201 thereafter would that i were not among the men of the fifth generation but either had died before or been born afterwards for now truly is a race of iron and men never rest from labour and sorrow by day and from perishing by night and the gods shall lay sore trouble upon them but notwithstanding even these shall have some good mingled with their evils and zeus will destroy this race of mortal men also when they come to have grey hair on the temples at their birth 6 the father will not agree with his children nor the children with their father nor guest with his host nor comrade with comrade nor will brother be dear to brother as aforetime men will dishonour their parents as they grow quickly old and will carp at them chiding them with bitter words hardhearted they not knowing the fear of the gods they will not repay their aged parents the cost their nurture for might shall be their right and one man will sack anothers city there will be no favour for the man who keeps his oath or for the just or for the good but rather men will praise the evildoer and his violent dealing strength will be right and reverence will cease to be and the wicked will hurt the worthy man speaking false words against him and will swear an oath upon them envy foulmouthed delighting in evil with scowling face will go along with wretched men one and all and then aidos and nemesis 7 with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes will go from the widepathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods and bitter sorrows will be left for mortal men and there will be no help against evil

ll 202211 and now i will tell a fable for princes who themselves understand thus said the hawk to the nightingale with speckled neck while he carried her high up among the clouds gripped fast in his talons and she pierced by his crooked talons cried pitifully to her he spoke disdainfully miserable thing why do you cry out one far stronger than you now holds you fast and you must go wherever i take you songstress as you are and if i please i will make my meal of you or let you go he is a fool who tries to withstand the stronger for he does not get the mastery and suffers pain besides his shame so said the swiftly flying hawk the long winged bird

ll 212224 but you perses listen to right and do not foster violence for violence is bad for a poor man even the prosperous cannot easily bear its burden but is weighed down under it when he has fallen into delusion the better path is to go by on the other side towards justice for justice beats outrage when she comes at length to the end of the race but only when he has suffered does the fool learn this for oath keeps pace with wrong judgements there is a noise when justice is being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements take her and she wrapped in mist follows to the city and haunts of the people weeping and bringing mischief to men even to such as have driven her forth in that they did not deal straightly with her

ll 225237 but they who give straight judgements to strangers and to the men of the land and go not aside from what is just their city flourishes and the people prosper in it peace the nurse of children is abroad in their land and allseeing zeus never decrees cruel war against them neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true justice but lightheartedly they tend the fields which are all their care the earth bears them victual in plenty and on the mountains the oak bears acorns upon the top and bees in the midst their woolly sheep are laden with fleeces their women bear children like their parents they flourish continually with good things and do not travel on ships for the graingiving earth bears them fruit

ll 238247 but for those who practise violence and cruel deeds farseeing zeus the son of cronos ordains a punishment often even a whole city suffers for a bad man who sins and devises presumptuous deeds and the son of cronos lays great trouble upon the people famine and plague together so that the men perish away and their women do not bear children and their houses become few through the contriving of olympian zeus and again at another time the son of cronos either destroys their wide army or their walls or else makes an end of their ships on the sea

ll 248264 you princes mark well this punishment you also for the deathless gods are near among men and mark all those who oppress their fellows with crooked judgements and reck not the anger of the gods for upon the bounteous earth zeus has thrice ten thousand spirits watchers of mortal men and these keep watch on judgements and deeds of wrong as they roam clothed in mist all over the earth and there is virgin justice the daughter of zeus who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who dwell on olympus and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander she sits beside her father zeus the son of cronos and tells him of mens wicked heart until the people pay for the mad folly of their princes who evilly minded pervert judgement and give sentence crookedly keep watch against this you princes and make straight your judgements you who devour bribes put crooked judgements altogether from your thoughts

ll 265266 he does mischief to himself who does mischief to another and evil planned harms the plotter most

ll 267273 the eye of zeus seeing all and understanding all beholds these things too if so he will and fails not to mark what sort of justice is this that the city keeps within it now therefore may neither i myself be righteous among men nor my son  for then it is a bad thing to be righteous  if indeed the unrighteous shall have the greater right but i think that allwise zeus will not yet bring that to pass

ll 274285 but you perses lay up these things within you heart and listen now to right ceasing altogether to think of violence for the son of cronos has ordained this law for men that fishes and beasts and winged fowls should devour one another for right is not in them but to mankind he gave right which proves far the best for whoever knows the right and is ready to speak it farseeing zeus gives him prosperity but whoever deliberately lies in his witness and forswears himself and so hurts justice and sins beyond repair that mans generation is left obscure thereafter but the generation of the man who swears truly is better thenceforward

ll 286292 to you foolish perses i will speak good sense badness can be got easily and in shoals the road to her is smooth and she lives very near us but between us and goodness the gods have placed the sweat of our brows long and steep is the path that leads to her and it is rough at the first but when a man has reached the top then is she easy to reach though before that she was hard

ll 293319 that man is altogether best who considers all things himself and marks what will be better afterwards and at the end and he again is good who listens to a good adviser but whoever neither thinks for himself nor keeps in mind what another tells him he is an unprofitable man but do you at any rate always remembering my charge work highborn perses that hunger may hate you and venerable demeter richly crowned may love you and fill your barn with food for hunger is altogether a meet comrade for the sluggard both gods and men are angry with a man who lives idle for in nature he is like the stingless drones who waste the labour of the bees eating without working but let it be your care to order your work properly that in the right season your barns may be full of victual through work men grow rich in flocks and substance and working they are much better loved by the immortals 8 work is no disgrace it is idleness which is a disgrace but if you work the idle will soon envy you as you grow rich for fame and renown attend on wealth and whatever be your lot work is best for you if you turn your misguided mind away from other mens property to your work and attend to your livelihood as i bid you an evil shame is the needy mans companion shame which both greatly harms and prospers men shame is with poverty but confidence with wealth
ll 320341 wealth should not be seized godgiven wealth is much better for it a man take great wealth violently and perforce or if he steal it through his tongue as often happens when gain deceives mens sense and dishonour tramples down honour the gods soon blot him out and make that mans house low and wealth attends him only for a little time alike with him who does wrong to a suppliant or a guest or who goes up to his brothers bed and commits unnatural sin in lying with his wife or who infatuately offends against fatherless children or who abuses his old father at the cheerless threshold of old age and attacks him with harsh words truly zeus himself is angry and at the last lays on him a heavy requittal for his evil doing but do you turn your foolish heart altogether away from these things and as far as you are able sacrifice to the deathless gods purely and cleanly and burn rich meats also and at other times propitiate them with libations and incense both when you go to bed and when the holy light has come back that they may be gracious to you in heart and spirit and so you may buy anothers holding and not another yours

ll 342351 call your friend to a feast but leave your enemy alone and especially call him who lives near you for if any mischief happen in the place neighbours come ungirt but kinsmen stay to gird themselves 9 a bad neighbour is as great a plague as a good one is a great blessing he who enjoys a good neighbour has a precious possession not even an ox would die but for a bad neighbour take fair measure from your neighbour and pay him back fairly with the same measure or better if you can so that if you are in need afterwards you may find him sure

ll 352369 do not get base gain base gain is as bad as ruin be friends with the friendly and visit him who visits you give to one who gives but do not give to one who does not give a man gives to the freehanded but no one gives to the close fisted give is a good girl but take is bad and she brings death for the man who gives willingly even though he gives a great thing rejoices in his gift and is glad in heart but whoever gives way to shamelessness and takes something himself even though it be a small thing it freezes his heart he who adds to what he has will keep off brighteyed hunger for it you add only a little to a little and do this often soon that little will become great what a man has by him at home does not trouble him it is better to have your stuff at home for whatever is abroad may mean loss it is a good thing to draw on what you have but it grieves your heart to need something and not to have it and i bid you mark this take your fill when the cask is first opened and when it is nearly spent but midways be sparing it is poor saving when you come to the lees

ll 370372 let the wage promised to a friend be fixed even with your brother smile  and get a witness for trust and mistrust alike ruin men

ll 373375 do not let a flaunting woman coax and cozen and deceive you she is after your barn the man who trusts womankind trust deceivers

ll 376380 there should be an only son to feed his fathers house for so wealth will increase in the home but if you leave a second son you should die old yet zeus can easily give great wealth to a greater number more hands mean more work and more increase

ll 381382 if your heart within you desires wealth do these things and work with work upon work

ll 383404 when the pleiades daughters of atlas are rising 10 begin your harvest and your ploughing when they are going to set 11 forty nights and days they are hidden and appear again as the year moves round when first you sharpen your sickle this is the law of the plains and of those who live near the sea and who inhabit rich country the glens and dingles far from the tossing sea  strip to sow and strip to plough and strip to reap if you wish to get in all demeters fruits in due season and that each kind may grow in its season else afterwards you may chance to be in want and go begging to other mens houses but without avail as you have already come to me but i will give you no more nor give you further measure foolish perses work the work which the gods ordained for men lest in bitter anguish of spirit you with your wife and children seek your livelihood amongst your neighbours and they do not heed you two or three times may be you will succeed but if you trouble them further it will not avail you and all your talk will be in vain and your wordplay unprofitable nay i bid you find a way to pay your debts and avoid hunger

ll 405413 first of all get a house and a woman and an ox for the plough  a slave woman and not a wife to follow the oxen as well  and make everything ready at home so that you may not have to ask of another and he refuses you and so because you are in lack the season pass by and your work come to nothing do not put your work off till tomorrow and the day after for a sluggish worker does not fill his barn nor one who puts off his work industry makes work go well but a man who putts off work is always at handgrips with ruin

ll 414447 when the piercing power and sultry heat of the sun abate and almighty zeus sends the autumn rains 12 and mens flesh comes to feel far easier  for then the star sirius passes over the heads of men who are born to misery only a little while by day and takes greater share of night  then when it showers its leaves to the ground and stops sprouting the wood you cut with your axe is least liable to worm then remember to hew your timber it is the season for that work cut a mortar 13 three feet wide and a pestle three cubits long and an axle of seven feet for it will do very well so but if you make it eight feet long you can cut a beetle 14 from it as well cut a felloe three spans across for a waggon of ten palms width hew also many bent timbers and bring home a ploughtree when you have found it and look out on the mountain or in the field for one of holmoak for this is the strongest for oxen to plough with when one of athenas handmen has fixed in the sharebeam and fastened it to the pole with dowels get two ploughs ready work on them at home one all of a piece and the other jointed it is far better to do this for if you should break one of them you can put the oxen to the other poles of laurel or elm are most free from worms and a sharebeam of oak and a ploughtree of holmoak get two oxen bulls of nine years for their strength is unspent and they are in the prime of their age they are best for work they will not fight in the furrow and break the plough and then leave the work undone let a brisk fellow of forty years follow them with a loaf of four quarters 15 and eight slices 16 for his dinner one who will attend to his work and drive a straight furrow and is past the age for gaping after his fellows but will keep his mind on his work no younger man will be better than he at scattering the seed and avoiding doublesowing for a man less staid gets disturbed hankering after his fellows

ll 448457 mark when you hear the voice of the crane 17 who cries year by year from the clouds above for she give the signal for ploughing and shows the season of rainy winter but she vexes the heart of the man who has no oxen then is the time to feed up your horned oxen in the byre for it is easy to say give me a yoke of oxen and a waggon and it is easy to refuse i have work for my oxen the man who is rich in fancy thinks his waggon as good as built already  the fool he does not know that there are a hundred timbers to a waggon take care to lay these up beforehand at home

ll 458464 so soon as the time for ploughing is proclaimed to men then make haste you and your slaves alike in wet and in dry to plough in the season for ploughing and bestir yourself early in the morning so that your fields may be full plough in the spring but fallow broken up in the summer will not belie your hopes sow fallow land when the soil is still getting light fallow land is a defender from harm and a soother of children

ll 465478 pray to zeus of the earth and to pure demeter to make demeters holy grain sound and heavy when first you begin ploughing when you hold in your hand the end of the ploughtail and bring down your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the polebar by the yokestraps let a slave follow a little behind with a mattock and make trouble for the birds by hiding the seed for good management is the best for mortal men as bad management is the worst in this way your cornears will bow to the ground with fullness if the olympian himself gives a good result at the last and you will sweep the cobwebs from your bins and you will be glad i ween as you take of your garnered substance and so you will have plenty till you come to grey 18 springtime and will not look wistfully to others but another shall be in need of your help
ll 479492 but if you plough the good ground at the solstice 19 you will reap sitting grasping a thin crop in your hand binding the sheaves awry dustcovered not glad at all so you will bring all home in a basket and not many will admire you yet the will of zeus who holds the aegis is different at different times and it is hard for mortal men to tell it for if you should plough late you may find this remedy  when the cuckoo first calls 20 in the leaves of the oak and makes men glad all over the boundless earth if zeus should send rain on the third day and not cease until it rises neither above an oxs hoof nor falls short of it then the lateplougher will vie with the early keep all this well in mind and fail not to mark grey spring as it comes and the season of rain

ll 493501 pass by the smithy and its crowded lounge in winter time when the cold keeps men from field work  for then an industrious man can greatly prosper his house  lest bitter winter catch you helpless and poor and you chafe a swollen foot with a shrunk hand the idle man who waits on empty hope lacking a livelihood lays to heart mischiefmaking it is not an wholesome hope that accompanies a need man who lolls at ease while he has no sure livelihood

ll 502503 while it is yet midsummer command your slaves it will not always be summer build barns

ll 504535 avoid the month lenaeon 21 wretched days all of them fit to skin an ox and the frosts which are cruel when boreas blows over the earth he blows across horsebreeding thrace upon the wide sea and stirs it up while earth and the forest howl on many a highleafed oak and thick pine he falls and brings them to the bounteous earth in mountain glens then all the immense wood roars and the beasts shudder and put their tails between their legs even those whose hide is covered with fur for with his bitter blast he blows even through them although they are shaggybreasted he goes even through an oxs hide it does not stop him also he blows through the goats fine hair but through the fleeces of sheep because their wool is abundant the keen wind boreas pierces not at all but it makes the old man curved as a wheel and it does not blow through the tender maiden who stays indoors with her dear mother unlearned as yet in the works of golden aphrodite and who washes her soft body and anoints herself with oil and lies down in an inner room within the house on a winters day when the boneless one 22 gnaws his foot in his fireless house and wretched home for the sun shows him no pastures to make for but goes to and fro over the land and city of dusky men 23 and shines more sluggishly upon the whole race of the hellenes then the horned and unhorned denizens of the wood with teeth chattering pitifully flee through the copses and glades and all as they seek shelter have this one care to gain thick coverts or some hollow rock then like the threelegged one 24 whose back is broken and whose head looks down upon the ground like him i say they wander to escape the white snow

ll 536563 then put on as i bid you a soft coat and a tunic to the feet to shield your body  and you should weave thick woof on thin warp in this clothe yourself so that your hair may keep still and not bristle and stand upon end all over your body
lace on your feet closefitting boots of the hide of a slaughtered ox thickly lined with felt inside and when the season of frost comes on stitch together skins of firstling kids with oxsinew to put over your back and to keep off the rain on your head above wear a shaped cap of felt to keep your ears from getting wet for the dawn is chill when boreas has once made his onslaught and at dawn a fruitful mist is spread over the earth from starry heaven upon the fields of blessed men it is drawn from the ever flowing rivers and is raised high above the earth by windstorm and sometimes it turns to rain towards evening and sometimes to wind when thracian boreas huddles the thick clouds finish your work and return home ahead of him and do not let the dark cloud from heaven wrap round you and make your body clammy and soak your clothes avoid it for this is the hardest month wintry hard for sheep and hard for men in this season let your oxen have half their usual food but let your man have more for the helpful nights are long observe all this until the year is ended and you have nights and days of equal length and earth the mother of all bears again her various fruit

ll 564570 when zeus has finished sixty wintry days after the solstice then the star arcturus 25 leaves the holy stream of ocean and first rises brilliant at dusk after him the shrilly wailing daughter of pandion the swallow appears to men when spring is just beginning before she comes prune the vines for it is best so

ll 571581 but when the housecarrier 26 climbs up the plants from the earth to escape the pleiades then it is no longer the season for digging vineyards but to whet your sickles and rouse up your slaves avoid shady seats and sleeping until dawn in the harvest season when the sun scorches the body then be busy and bring home your fruits getting up early to make your livelihood sure for dawn takes away a third part of your work dawn advances a man on his journey and advances him in his work  dawn which appears and sets many men on their road and puts yokes on many oxen

ll 582596 but when the artichoke flowers 27 and the chirping grasshopper sits in a tree and pours down his shrill song continually from under his wings in the season of wearisome heat then goats are plumpest and wine sweetest women are most wanton but men are feeblest because sirius parches head and knees and the skin is dry through heat but at that time let me have a shady rock and wine of biblis a clot of curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of an heifer fed in the woods that has never calved and of firstling kids then also let me drink bright wine sitting in the shade when my heart is satisfied with food and so turning my head to face the fresh zephyr from the everflowing spring which pours down unfouled thrice pour an offering of water but make a fourth libation of wine

ll 597608 set your slaves to winnow demeters holy grain when strong orion 28 first appears on a smooth threshingfloor in an airy place then measure it and store it in jars and so soon as you have safely stored all your stuff indoors i bid you put your bondman out of doors and look out for a servantgirl with no children  for a servant with a child to nurse is troublesome and look after the dog with jagged teeth do not grudge him his food or some time the daysleeper 29 may take your stuff bring in fodder and litter so as to have enough for your oxen and mules after that let your men rest their poor knees and unyoke your pair of oxen

ll 609617 but when orion and sirius are come into midheaven and rosyfingered dawn sees arcturus 30 then cut off all the grapeclusters perses and bring them home show them to the sun ten days and ten nights then cover them over for five and on the sixth day draw off into vessels the gifts of joyful dionysus but when the pleiades and hyades and strong orion begin to set 31 then remember to plough in season and so the completed year 32 will fitly pass beneath the earth

ll 618640 but if desire for uncomfortable seafaring seize you when the pleiades plunge into the misty sea 33 to escape orions rude strength then truly gales of all kinds rage then keep ships no longer on the sparkling sea but bethink you to till the land as i bid you haul up your ship upon the land and pack it closely with stones all round to keep off the power of the winds which blow damply and draw out the bilgeplug so that the rain of heaven may not rot it put away all the tackle and fittings in your house and stow the wings of the seagoing ship neatly and hang up the wellshaped rudder over the smoke you yourself wait until the season for sailing is come and then haul your swift ship down to the sea and stow a convenient cargo in it so that you may bring home profit even as your father and mine foolish perses used to sail on shipboard because he lacked sufficient livelihood and one day he came to this very place crossing over a great stretch of sea he left aeolian cyme and fled not from riches and substance but from wretched poverty which zeus lays upon men and he settled near helicon in a miserable hamlet ascra which is bad in winter sultry in summer and good at no time

ll 641645 but you perses remember all works in their season but sailing especially admire a small ship but put your freight in a large one for the greater the lading the greater will be your piled gain if only the winds will keep back their harmful gales

ll 646662 if ever you turn your misguided heart to trading and with to escape from debt and joyless hunger i will show you the measures of the loudroaring sea though i have no skill in seafaring nor in ships for never yet have i sailed by ship over the wide sea but only to euboea from aulis where the achaeans once stayed through much storm when they had gathered a great host from divine hellas for troy the land of fair women then i crossed over to chalcis to the games of wise amphidamas where the sons of the greathearted hero proclaimed and appointed prizes and there i boast that i gained the victory with a song and carried off an handled tripod which i dedicated to the muses of helicon in the place where they first set me in the way of clear song such is all my experience of manypegged ships nevertheless i will tell you the will of zeus who holds the aegis for the muses have taught me to sing in marvellous song

ll 663677 fifty days after the solstice 34 when the season of wearisome heat is come to an end is the right time for me to go sailing then you will not wreck your ship nor will the sea destroy the sailors unless poseidon the earthshaker be set upon it or zeus the king of the deathless gods wish to slay them for the issues of good and evil alike are with them at that time the winds are steady and the sea is harmless then trust in the winds without care and haul your swift ship down to the sea and put all the freight no board but make all haste you can to return home again and do not wait till the time of the new wine and autumn rain and oncoming storms with the fierce gales of notus who accompanies the heavy autumn rain of zeus and stirs up the sea and makes the deep dangerous

ll 678694 another time for men to go sailing is in spring when a man first sees leaves on the topmost shoot of a figtree as large as the footprint that a cow makes then the sea is passable and this is the spring sailing time for my part i do not praise it for my heart does not like it such a sailing is snatched and you will hardly avoid mischief yet in their ignorance men do even this for wealth means life to poor mortals but it is fearful to die among the waves but i bid you consider all these things in your heart as i say do not put all your goods in hallow ships leave the greater part behind and put the lesser part on board for it is a bad business to meet with disaster among the waves of the sea as it is bad if you put too great a load on your waggon and break the axle and your goods are spoiled observe due measure and proportion is best in all things

ll 695705 bring home a wife to your house when you are of the right age while you are not far short of thirty years nor much above this is the right age for marriage let your wife have been grown up four years and marry her in the fifth marry a maiden so that you can teach her careful ways and especially marry one who lives near you but look well about you and see that your marriage will not be a joke to your neighbours for a man wins nothing better than a good wife and again nothing worse than a bad one a greedy soul who roasts her man without fire strong though he may be and brings him to a raw 35 old age

ll 706714 be careful to avoid the anger of the deathless gods do not make a friend equal to a brother but if you do do not wrong him first and do not lie to please the tongue but if he wrongs you first offending either in word or in deed remember to repay him double but if he ask you to be his friend again and be ready to give you satisfaction welcome him he is a worthless man who makes now one and now another his friend but as for you do not let your face put your heart to shame 36

ll 715716 do not get a name either as lavish or as churlish as a friend of rogues or as a slanderer of good men

ll 717721 never dare to taunt a man with deadly poverty which eats out the heart it is sent by the deathless gods the best treasure a man can have is a sparing tongue and the greatest pleasure one that moves orderly for if you speak evil you yourself will soon be worse spoken of

ll 722723 do not be boorish at a common feast where there are many guests the pleasure is greatest and the expense is least 37

ll 724726 never pour a libation of sparkling wine to zeus after dawn with unwashen hands nor to others of the deathless gods else they do not hear your prayers but spit them back

ll 727732 do not stand upright facing the sun when you make water but remember to do this when he has set towards his rising and do not make water as you go whether on the road or off the road and do not uncover yourself the nights belong to the blessed gods a scrupulous man who has a wise heart sits down or goes to the wall of an enclosed court

ll 733736 do not expose yourself befouled by the fireside in your house but avoid this do not beget children when you are come back from illomened burial but after a festival of the gods

ll 737741 never cross the sweetflowing water of everrolling rivers afoot until you have prayed gazing into the soft flood and washed your hands in the clear lovely water whoever crosses a river with hands unwashed of wickedness the gods are angry with him and bring trouble upon him afterwards

ll 742743 at a cheerful festival of the gods do not cut the withered from the quick upon that which has five branches 38 with bright steel

ll 744745 never put the ladle upon the mixingbowl at a wine party for malignant illluck is attached to that

ll 746747 when you are building a house do not leave it roughhewn or a cawing crow may settle on it and croak

ll 748749 take nothing to eat or to wash with from uncharmed pots for in them there is mischief

ll 750759 do not let a boy of twelve years sit on things which may not be moved 39 for that is bad and makes a man unmanly nor yet a child of twelve months for that has the same effect a man should not clean his body with water in which a woman has washed for there is bitter mischief in that also for a time when you come upon a burning sacrifice do not make a mock of mysteries for heaven is angry at this also never make water in the mouths of rivers which flow to the sea nor yet in springs but be careful to avoid this and do not ease yourself in them it is not well to do this

ll 760763 so do and avoid the talk of men for talk is mischievous light and easily raised but hard to bear and difficult to be rid of talk never wholly dies away when many people voice her even talk is in some ways divine

ll 765767 mark the days which come from zeus duly telling your slaves of them and that the thirtieth day of the month is best for one to look over the work and to deal out supplies

ll 769768 40 for these are days which come from zeus the allwise when men discern aright

ll 770779 to begin with the first the fourth and the seventh  on which leto bare apollo with the blade of gold  each is a holy day the eighth and the ninth two days at least of the waxing month 41 are specially good for the works of man also the eleventh and twelfth are both excellent alike for shearing sheep and for reaping the kindly fruits but the twelfth is much better than the eleventh for on it the airyswinging spider spins its web in full day and then the wise one 42 gathers her pile on that day woman should set up her loom and get forward with her work

ll 780781 avoid the thirteenth of the waxing month for beginning to sow yet it is the best day for setting plants

ll 782789 the sixth of the midmonth is very unfavourable for plants but is good for the birth of males though unfavourable for a girl either to be born at all or to be married nor is the first sixth a fit day for a girl to be born but a kindly for gelding kids and sheep and for fencing in a sheepcote it is favourable for the birth of a boy but such will be fond of sharp speech lies and cunning words and stealthy converse

ll 790791 on the eighth of the month geld the boar and loud bellowing bull but hardworking mules on the twelfth

ll 792799 on the great twentieth in full day a wise man should be born such an one is very soundwitted the tenth is favourable for a male to be born but for a girl the fourth day of the midmonth on that day tame sheep and shambling horned oxen and the sharpfanged dog and hardy mules to the touch of the hand but take care to avoid troubles which eat out the heart on the fourth of the beginning and ending of the month it is a day very fraught with fate

ll 800801 on the fourth of the month bring home your bride but choose the omens which are best for this business

ll 802804 avoid fifth days they are unkindly and terrible on a fifth day they say the erinyes assisted at the birth of horcus oath whom eris strife bare to trouble the forsworn

ll 805809 look about you very carefully and throw out demeters holy grain upon the wellrolled 43 threshing floor on the seventh of the midmonth let the woodman cut beams for house building and plenty of ships timbers such as are suitable for ships on the fourth day begin to build narrow ships

ll 810813 the ninth of the midmonth improves towards evening but the first ninth of all is quite harmless for men it is a good day on which to beget or to be born both for a male and a female it is never an wholly evil day

ll 814818 again few know that the twentyseventh of the month is best for opening a winejar and putting yokes on the necks of oxen and mules and swiftfooted horses and for hauling a swift ship of many thwarts down to the sparkling sea few call it by its right name

ll 819821 on the fourth day open a jar the fourth of the midmonth is a day holy above all and again few men know that the fourth day after the twentieth is best while it is morning towards evening it is less good

ll 822828 these days are a great blessing to men on earth but the rest are changeable luckless and bring nothing everyone praises a different day but few know their nature sometimes a day is a stepmother sometimes a mother that man is happy and lucky in them who knows all these things and does his work without offending the deathless gods who discerns the omens of birds and avoids transgressionsendnotes1 that is the poor mans fare like bread and cheese
