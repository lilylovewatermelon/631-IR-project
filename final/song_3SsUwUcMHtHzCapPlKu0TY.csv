kiss my lips and taste the sauvignon
i wrap the vines around your thighs
i can see the kind of tip youre on
theres no confusion in your eyes

chorus
lets unwind together
together
ease our minds together
together

verse 2
taking sips to push the moment on
but its just the bottle thats run dry
lose the watch cause we got nothing on
and im not keeping track of time

chorus
lets unwind together
together
ease our minds together
together

interlude
