if you want it to happen baybay
hold fast and believe
you can make it happen baybay
you can be where u pleaze
all you gotta do is try
then try once again
then try a few more times
then try after then

when i was a little girl
raised on n philly streets
id hear my people say
ghettoz all theyd be
but my mommy would hold me
quietly give me peace
shed look me in my eyes and shed say to me

chorus
if you want it to happen baybay
hold fast and believe
you can make it happen baybay
you can be where u pleaze
all you gotta do is try
then try once again
then try a few more times
then try after then

and just when my will was lost
and all hope seemed set free
id remember my mamas face and her tellin me

but wit a lot of faith and the same amount of effort
i can withstand it all

im now enjoyin the beautiful world and the many new faces
