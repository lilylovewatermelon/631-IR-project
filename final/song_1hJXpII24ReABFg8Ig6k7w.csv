i am hungry
i have been hungry
i was born hungry
what do i need
i am something
i have been something
i was born something
what could i be

chorus 1
there is a light that i can see
but only it seems when theres darkness in me
there is a dream that i sometimes see
that only appears in the dark of sleep

verse 2
i am waiting
i have been waiting
i was born waiting
i was born waiting
for that something
just to want something
i was born something
i was born

there is a light i feel it in me
but only it seems when the dark surrounds me
there is a dream and it sleeps in me
to awake in the night crying set me free
and i awake every night crying set me free11embed"
