verse 1 boss
go step to my battlefield where my niggas come from
all we know is kill bill thats right

try me some niggas at no will
now watch me slow it down and then i take it in slow motion
and then i speed it up and take it fast like a nigga on a top speed coaster

load em up take aim and we ready to attack
and aint no backing down
we go pound for pound round for round we knock em down
now if you think you got them hands and nigga thats the plan
imma knock yo ass down like the black jackie chan
the squad aint loosing these bitches keep choosing
and thats why ay ay

cause he keep doing the same ole move constantly

roll your arms and show your swag now break his legs arms neck yea
