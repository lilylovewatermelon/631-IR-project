getting hard to remember
getting hard to recall
getting laid off and pushed out
and it aint my babys fault

chorus
so if you go dont cry
ill be right there at your side
sherrill sherrill

verse 2
getting laid on the lifeline
getting tired time for bed
and theres no use getting worked up
ill remember all you said

chorus
so if you go dont cry
ill be right there at your side
