i can still shut down a party
i can hang with anybody
i can drink whiskey and red wine
champagne all night
little scotch on the rocks and im fine im fine

chorus dan  shay  dan
but when i taste tequila
baby i still see ya
cuttin up the floor in a sorority tshirt
the same one you wore when we were
sky high in colorado your lips pressed against the bottle
swearing on a bible baby id never leave ya
i remember how bad i need ya
when i taste tequila when i when i when i
when i taste tequila when i when i when i

and not even think about you
i can show up to the same bar
hear the same songs in my car
baby your memory it only hits me this hard
