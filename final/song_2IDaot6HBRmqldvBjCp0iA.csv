you dug my heart a grave
i watched you illustrate the expression of another lonely girl
and there you lie awake
and wish you knew a way to fade the blaring silence from your only world

prechorus
and now youre running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light

chorus
ooh oh
its inevitable aint it
you left without sayin
ooh oh
i hope the cracks in the pavement lead back to you baby
back to you baby

verse 2

just to make room for any
thoughts of caressin your sweet
anatomy as we sleep
the taste you left on my teeth
your breath across my left cheek
the feelin chemically oh

now youre running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light

its inevitable aint it
you left without sayin
ooh oh
i hope the cracks in the pavement lead back to you baby
back to you baby

and now youre running to the sound of the light
