slip slippin on my versace new york party
icy drip drippin on emerald snake thank you bvlgari
get there quick my chauffeur drove me back like a performer
i went straight straight to dance and saw you

prechorus
youre lookin for danger hungry eyes
are you sure are you free are you mine
looking for a stranger fantasize
dont let go let me out of your sight

chorus
you got me thinkin ehoh
if you dont dont know my name
then baby you can just call me tonight ehoh
if i go youll go insane
then baby you can just call me tonight oohooh
call me tonight oohooh
call me tonight
just call me tonight

verse 2
break break your heart in the mornin dont you worry
and ill fly fly away before its love before youve boarded

when the sun is beating i beat it
