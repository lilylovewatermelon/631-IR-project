trading life for life
it all must fall
it must end with us
it must end with me

verse 1
insinuations of what might be
fight through deprivation
there will be no sleep

hook
heed my cry

verse 2
because of greed and hatred
to dust we return
they will see the strength in our numbers
only then will the selfrighteous learn
yeah

verse 3
insinuations of what might be
to the masses we mean nothing
but it starts in the hearts of the few
witness the birth of a people
unite renew

there is no forever just today just today
dont let your your sacrifice waste away
waste away waste away

verse 4
through change and purity
turn the shadows to light
buried beneath the ashes
is a passion for life

there is no forever just today just today
dont let your your sacrifice waste away
waste away waste away

let there be no more of this bloodshed
let there be no more of this bloodshed
let there be no more of this bloodshed
