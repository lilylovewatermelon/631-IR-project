remember when there was nothin else to do
but lie in bed and
wonder how it was always up to you
and no one else and

prechorus 1
early mornings made by warnings
whats the point of the alarm that im ignoring
its even raining im not complaining
but waking up is hard to do so

chorus
turn my head its back to bed with no delay
i cant be bothered by the phone ten times today
why get up my morning doesnt even start til two
forget reality waking up is hard to do

verse 2
remember when we would hang out everyday
and we would rather
not be told what to do or what to say
cause nothing mattered

prechorus 2
never boring sleptin mornings
not ashamed of the habits that im forming
its not important if days are shortened
i cant make time when nothings new
cause waking up is hard to do so

verse 3
whats a day when it all ends up the same
and lasts forever
cant complain when theres nothin there to blame
and things cant be better

prechorus 3
summer evenings teenage grievings
got no problem with the life that ive been leading
no concentration on hesitation
i cant make time when nothings new
cause waking up is hard to do so

chorus
turn my head its back to bed with no delay
i cant be bothered by the phone ten times today
why get up my morning doesnt even start til two
forget reality waking up is hard to do1embed"
