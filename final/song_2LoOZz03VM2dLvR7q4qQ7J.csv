hello miss heartbroke sit your sweet self down
its good to see your dancin feet back out on the town
rumor has it youve had trouble with your man
ive had trouble of my own i think i understand

chorus
well put out your old flame well build a bigger fire
ill pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
and if his memory comes around and you think you still care
well burn that bridge when we get there

verse 2
come on let your hair down well have us a time
he had his chance with you now all i want is mine
give me half an hour or just a dance or two
and youll forget old whatshisname and how he walked out on you

chorus
well put out your old flame well build a bigger fire
ill pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
and if his memory comes around and you think you still care
well burn that bridge when we get there

chorus
well put out your old flame well build a bigger fire
ill pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
and if his memory comes around and you think you still care
well burn that bridge when we get there
