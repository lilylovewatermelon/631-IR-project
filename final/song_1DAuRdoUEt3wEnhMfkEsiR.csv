i hear its a real swingin place
there isnt much air
or gravity there
the stars will make your heart race
lets take a rocket
lets take a rocket
lets take a rocketship to space

lets take a saucer to the stars
look out moon move over mars
the martians all rock
to bassie and bach
so bring your maracas and your jazz guitars
lets take a saucer to the stars

instrumental interlude

lets take a rocket ship
a crazy threestage rocket ship
lets take a rocket ship to spaceyou might also likeembed"
