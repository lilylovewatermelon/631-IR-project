seems theres something in the air today
it’s got me feeling oh a certain way
seems like lately ive been on the run
its got me reeling every night i’m done
keep thinking what am i supposed to do
my bodys not working like it used to
and these bills keep piling up on me
remember when i had no responsibilities

chorus
so take me back when i was younger
and i was still hungry oh
take me back when i was younger
yeah i got the world at my feet
just try and stop me just try and stop me
yeah take me back when i was younger

verse 2
watching all my friends pass away
when they promised me that they would be here today
i wish that i could put a force field
around every single one of us
i would protect you from everything
id put a force field all around us
and ground us forever and ever
