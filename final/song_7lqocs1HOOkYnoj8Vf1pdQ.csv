you ever heard of sinners prayer
you ever had life come and shatter your dreams
you ever heard of sinners prayer
you ever talk to god and then in turned into a scream

verse 1 jelly roll
the weed isnt helping the liquor dont work
i done did all i can im still feeling this hurt
i been trying to change i still feel like im cursed
well the drugs and the stress had appealed to me first
it comes and it goes its all that i know
no matter what all the problems just go
rolled up to smoked choppеd up the dough
been trying to fill up this hole in my soul
im on this lonely road i need thе holy ghost
lord wont you come and save me
im such a broken soul i feel like no one knows
stress im dealing with lately
its my last shot for me to save my spot
and they dont make pain pills to help the pain i got

chorus jelly roll
loneliness is all ive ever known
it starts to take its toll
a heart can turn to stone
loneliness is all ive ever known
no matter where i go
id rather be alone

the drugs in my system are taking my spirit and breaking me down
ill drown in this liquor and scream at the mirror but no ones around

verse 2 rittz
i drink so much crown
drained my account
used to pray i need faith these days
i pray i pass out
finally got to that tippin point
i dont really care about this rap shit no more
most likely to get divorced before next year
better yet wind up dead instead
hanging suspended from the extension cord
i pray to god quit toying with me kill me please
my body feeling like a wilted leaf
i cant keep down food my liver protruding
through my ribs drinking liquor like its new years eve
but its monday im breaking one shade
i really wanna take my anger out on some ones face
its funny all the money i just saved is gone someones dead
it got swept underneath the rug with some blood stains
i never listened when they told me its a dumb dream
the industry is full of greedy cash
 then they worry that we on things
dont underestimate the ignorance
i used to want to pull the trigger then
but im sober now and im feeling so good
dont pull it dont pull it
only thing getting stuck in my head is this jelly roll hook
so long
chorus jelly roll
loneliness is all ive ever known
it starts to take its toll
a heart can turn to stone
loneliness is all ive ever known
no matter where i go
id rather be alone
