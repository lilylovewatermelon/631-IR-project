lets burn it fucking down
yeah

verse 1
back from the dead to tell you that im alive
killed the old way but i survived
fuck the blueprint i redesign
death or exile you decide
tell em all that i made my name
tell em all that i paved my way
found the fear then went face to face
now its mine to send up in flames

prechorus
cause this right here is as far as you go
this right here is where i lose control
this right here is as far as you go

chorus
burn it all down burn it all down
i dont give a fuck
burn it all down burn it to the ground
feed the flames go insane
and burn it all down burn it all down
fuck what they say fuck everything
light the match gasoline
kill it all kill everything
and burn it all down burn it all down
see i prevail liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeverse 2
nothin but red inside when i close my eyes
vision built that you cant deny
born and bred to take back whats mine
break or bow down you decide
tell em all that you cant be saved
tell em all that you dug this grave
learn to live in this mess you made
now its mine to send up in flames

prechorus
cause this right here is as far as you go
this right here is the end of the road
this right here is as far as you go

chorus
so burn it all down burn it all down
i dont give a fuck
burn it all down burn it to the ground
feed the flames go insane
and burn it all down burn it all down

bridge
the time is up
theres no return
fuck them all
watch them burn
yeah cause i dont give a fuck
chorus
fuck what they say fuck everything
light the match gasoline
kill it all kill everything
and burn it all down burn it all down7embed"
