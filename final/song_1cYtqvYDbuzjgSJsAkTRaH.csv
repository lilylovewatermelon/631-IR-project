just let me say one thing
ive had enough
youre selfish and sorry
youll never learn how to love
as your world disassembles
better keep your head up

prechorus
your name your face is all you have left now
betrayed disgraced youve been erased

chorus
so long so long
i have erased you
so long so long
ive wanted to waste you
so long so long
i have erased you
i have escaped
the bitter taste of you

verse 2
just let me clear my head
i think ive had too much
youre so disappointing
but you make good use of it
as your world disassembles
better keep your head up
