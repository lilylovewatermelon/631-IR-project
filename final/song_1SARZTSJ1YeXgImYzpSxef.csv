1overall great idea i just wanted to point out something else…like the fact that im not blind






yes like the fact that i’m not blind i’ve been noticing how much the xs were against all the qrules work the downvotes in the qs forum posts prove it

my opinion
ur just plain hatin i don’t care and also i’m not blind i can see what ur doing

my suggestion
why should i give you a suggestion downvote all you like qs don’t care as alphaqup said in the qrules headquarters pagelol pssshh we eat witchu we eat witoutchuqrules still be like 2thaeqsplanator
all editors have coaching potential why

the logicwe have all come from where the people who we coach came from a state when we were unable to accept reject edit and whatever else we know how it felt therefore we know what can make those peeps feel great encouragement is a huge part of coaching and because we understand those noneditors we can be great at encouraging sympathy and understanding is very important equally important we were editored mostly based on our annotating skills therefore we know how to annotate better than the people we coach and we can pass off our own skills to them like i did in my personal guide to editorship






how can you possibly be not “coaching material” come on we can all do this it’s not like you’re a kindergartener trying to teach me algebra lol idk i can come up with pretty weird examples sometimes
well in conclusion there is no such thing as an editor who’s not coaching material we all are face the logic we just are

thanks for your support to the q fam though who else can join this cheer let’s go qrules3mypodnerskorg yes i saw that you upvoted alpha’s reply to slickk and laqsman672 which is awesome but i can’t say i’m giving you credit for upvoting reflexioneternal’s giantx






on this idea

lol can we just forget that i personally said that you could downvote all you like we wouldn’t care…so how about let’s not care for once
i honestly don’t care for votes but if this goes on there’s gonna be a big deal and all that stuff and i don’t want another huge conflict over a few puny votes q vs x is enough for nowjune 28th 2014  alphaqupsill remember this day foreverjune 28th i see



okay not really but autumn can i just say ithappy birthday
gelukkige verjaardag
生日快乐
joyeux anniversaire
お誕生日おめでとうございます

plz dont ask which languages those were june28ftwjuly 9th 2014  fransouls official world cup thread the sequel in reply to thisfransoul at the very least king of football
and here’s this thing some of messi’s fans wherever in the world made
and yet another onejuly 11th 2014  fransouls official world cup thread the sequelarghhh i am so not going to enjoy it
i’m scared of
1 argentina loses

that way leo’s haters will triumph besides he’d carried the burden all through the group games and deserves a break and that would mean germany beat them again after the quarterfinal that went 40 in 2010
2 argentina wins

that means the brazilians will kill them you ask literally or practically i say pick ‘em
i still feel bad for brazil tho that defeat…july 11th 2014  fransouls official world cup thread the sequelfransoul wandawaisu
you two are driving me crazy lmao let me just say this everything you say is based on your opinion even when you state a fact because when you do it means you agree with the fact again your opinion

there is no true best player in the world you can’t see everything from the stats but whoever is better to you is better — to you if you guys keep arguing about this it’ll never end and it’s probably much easier for both of you if you just let it go lol i know right let it go stick to your own opinion and never mind when someone else’s interferes with yours keep going your way because it’s yours

btw ur probably giving everyone who follows this thread a post overload hahaha july 23rd 2014  srthepanglosss whats your whymy reason

let’s not talk about me let’s talk about sailing or something

ok fine i just really really hate selfishness like not regular selfishness as in “i want that cookie” but real selfishness stuff like “i’m the best i take all ur credit to benefit myself i’m still the best” that’s what im talking about

so my reason
yeah to train myself to be less selfish i put in all my work to benefit others what you may call troll posts are actually my attempts to cheer up anyone sad who may be reading at the moment what you may call iq whoring is me cleaning up a taylor swift song for people who want to understand the lyrics fully genius did me a favor when i wanted to understand summertime sadness and i owe the favor so i do all i can to contribute as much as i can for the sake of others not myself you guys call me an iq whore or trouble user as much as you want i’m more concerned with this priority than what others think of me

the point let’s not talk about me how about more people’s why’s

autumnsayshellq alphaqup darkthoughtsquedreams

tag more people you want to ask and do whatever i’m done with tagging in this lagging page hahajuly 31st 2014  my own new page genius username definitionsnow we all know genius’s motto is “annotate the world” or at least something like that

recently the geniuses on this site have come up with some new things to annotateexplain — the fifa world cup 2014 so to sportsgenius the first six chapters of divergent after the publisher giving us permission so to thescrivener for this and the dictionary although we haven’t gotten to doing that yet so to dyazz and ewokabdevito for that though d

yes those were all pretty recent all the trends and awesome ideas and everything those were really great i just found that there was some sort missing…

my first thought was the genius user directory and how that was different from most stuff on the site the question — why did it seem so different

then it hit me — we need more ways to connect with other users so to make this diverse community easier to understand for everybody knowing each other better is good for all of us as we are working towards annotating the world my 5th grade teacher was right about the importance of being able to cooperate and understanding your fellow geniuses is a big step in that

in other words if we bicker about who’s older than who and what’s the reason who’s more mature than who and who’s from where which means who’s more awesome and that junk we will never get anywhere with genius’s goal to annotate the world we won’t even get anywhere with annotating because we’re bickering too much that’s how it would be like if nobody here understood anyone else on the site

but how the directory idea was already taken haha

and now i really have to thank alphaqup for what you guys are reading right now and the people who posted in this thread mostly denzelparkingsons for realizing what alpha’s name meant and posting about it in that nowclassic thread

so what if there were other people who used tricks like this for their usernames to make things a bit more interesting that’s exactly what i thought when i read the thread mindblown as i was everyone’s curious about those names that seem to make no sense until they finally grasp the genius of it all but not everybody wants to wait an eternity for an inspiration to hit them so they can understand one of those puzzling names

i decided to both make it easier for those people who don’t want to wait meaning almost everyone and to make this community a more connected one it was going to require something different from the usual for sure the last and not least most way to do that was to create this

httpgeniuscomrapgeniususersgeniususernamedefinitionsannotated

yes it was my idea but my idea came from not only me remember that also remember that no name on genius is ungenius except for the marked as spam gone names duh so add yourself and annotate your name in any way you want except for anything inappropriate like putting porn in it lol just follow the community policy and we won’t come chasing after you to put you in pb for a week you’ll be fine

sorry about that i was just joking and i don’t want there to be any misunderstandings

now to end this post in a way different from the usual let me just steal alpha’s gif on his tate from the username definitions page for a moment…

august 2014  my own your definition of lyricstextsanything reallyas id explained here
httpgeniuscom3948835yourdefinitionofidinamenzelsletitgoyourdefinitionofftjessmaqswellidinamenzelsletitgo

that only applied to songs but you can do it with anything else on genius you’d like really just make the main artist your definition of and format the title like this

artist’s song title

for example the first one i put on genius was idina menzel’s let it go so i made the title “idina menzel’s let it go”

clear enough feel free to add your own tates as long as you’re verified on genius only allows one community annotation per line but many verified tates and just add your artist name to the list of featured artists to whichever song you want to joinaugust 2014  regularrys trolls are running wild in the forums
haha i haven’t been on rap forum lately though haven’t encountered a lotaugust 2014  dyazzs but its hard to insist on that without stepping on someones toeslol dyazz i was so flattered and i don’t know why i laugh when people either 1 brag about themselves 2 brag about someone else or 3 brag about me when they clearly know i can see it but thanks

the “perfect editor” though…i think the thing that gets you to being a moderator is being an extraordinarily good editor or something like that so why am i not a mod yet haha just kidding no worries i don’t mind not being mod i don’t mind not being anything here as long as i can contribute to the site at my best

but yeah it’s a really good thing that you brought this up as i am sure this happens everywhere i think that you should keep the user as an editor but keep on coaching them with that mod even though they’re editor already you know like what they did with darkthoughtsquedreamsmurkman a while ago tell the editor that they’re doing fine just that you’re giving them another challenge or whatever you’d do to coach them to make them an even better editor i kind of learned my own way on genius by observing other editors and mods but not everyone learns like that so keep in mind to give any assistance needed

tag me in the new thread for what’s a good editor though can’t wait to hear about it 3

btw a correction — the heart is missing a one at the end it should be 331 like the 331 in my name haha

no literally correct it or else there’ll be…you have been warnedaugust 2014  akncxvs suggestion on downvoteswho else hates 0 iq user downvotesseptember 2014  regularrys never forget  rip in peace

1 — old notif buttons
2 — name not on your profile page link anymore
3 — sign out button is now a gear with more functions for editors than log out
4 — that bunch is now at the bottom of the page
5 — overall colour and even template of the website changed
6 — editors can now see activity
7 — template for annotations on profile page changed
8 — old link blue is now a steel blue
9 — rock chat used to say “rock editor chat” and now it’s just rock chat
10 — even the name of the website changed

this is 2014 guys…the year of updates

and i’m sure everyone remembers how laggy it was at one time and how we all learned to never take unlagginess for granted again the site is awesome now but the old times………………………are simply irreplaceable yes rip in peace memoriesseptember 2014  my own this website copied geniuswell at least it seems like so to me

has anyone ever noticed this site

httpmusixmatchcom

here’s a lyric page for you to see what i’m talking about just highlight a line any line

they copied us you even have to sign in to explain their lyrics and there are upvotes and downvotes and they have music players too although none of that is as good as ours if you don’t trust me go to the links you’ll see exactly what i’m talking about

still no matter how many other lyric explanation sites are out there genius will always be the one i’m loyal to

and here’s another link

httpswwwmusixmatchcomcommunitymeanings

genius forever forget all other explanation sitesoctober 2014  slickks delete spam accounts on the runslickk i knew that it had to be deleted at some time so i took a few screenshots
drag it over to your link to see the fullscreen because it’s not as boss to view at un fullscreen feel free to save it to your desktop lol

again wandawaisu when are you going to be on to see theseoctober 2014  chrissweatshirts mods please contact this userchrissweatshirt feel you on the bad grammar thing but i think he did the bad grammar on purpose to tell people that the page was a joke — a page that informs you on collegeuniversity enrollment should at least have good grammar that is not pointless i’m 12 and common sense tells me that just saying

pretty sure this guy is a troll though by looking at the message history…it’s obvious enough nontrolls don’t spam bulky mental insulting essayish paragraphs when you ask a harmless question right based on that analysis this jerome guy just wanted to pranktroll you so the best thing for you to do was probably to send a plain “lol” message or something that didn’t tell him you saw what he said as disrespect

he was probably just pissed off that you didn’t get his joke because he’s a troll after all and he also didn’t get the fact that jokes aren’t always obvious to others i don’t freaking get the cac thing either and i’m just going to ignore it so he just tested you on how you would react if he tried to give you a more offensive joke i’m not saying you’re dumb i’m not saying jerome is dumb i’m not saying anything against anyone except that jerome is a troll and kind of immature too the point he sees that message he sent you as a joke and he knows that you saw it as disrespect so now he thinks you’re not that smart biased view so don’t take it personally but he needs to learn the fact that smart doesn’t mean you get every single stupid troll joke everyone makes my friend got a really high iq score and she outlogics me all the time but i still have to explain some troll jokes to her some of these troll jokes just don’t make sense and aren’t funny but you’ve just got to deal with it

sorry for the essay everyone downvote all you want i’m outoctober 2014  alphaqups borderlands the presequel gameplaycommentary by ggs very own autumnsayshellqhas anyone else ever realized that “autumn” rhymes with “awesome”

well it’s only a loose rhyme but still qongrats man  and that name “autumnplayshello” — sooo qreativenovember 2014  semgro8s goal pages…i didn’t even notice that there was a barcelona page

the player pages tend to be more specific though and the goals are actually in numbered list form there and it’s a little easier to find specific goals because these ones just seem more organized than a gigantic list of the whole club’s goals

i’d say that playerspecific pages are better for those superstars who score tons of goals but probably won’t work for people who score less and get less attentiondecember 29th 2014  in dc26s change
1i don’t know if this is helpful or not but here it goes
i suggest a “neighborhood watch strategy” sorry about any possible reference to illuminati which is nontech but it could do something…

like say if a mod trolls in chat with the warning thing or whatever else mods can do a user would have some sort of power to hit up a staff member about it and the staff member has to speak to the mod and try to solve the problem this is serious and when help from staff is needed we need you to come and lend us a hand to solve some problems

this would only work even the least bit if everybody cooperates though and if we don’t all “watch” again illuminati reference not intended each other and report whoever’s misbehaving that could just result in everything reoccuring

so basically all i’m saying is please everyone in the community don’t feel as if the mods have too much more power over you and that they can take advantage of you with their powers and you have nothing to do if any mod is being unfair feel free to report them don’t be like “but i’m a whitehat” or “but i’m not a mod” everyone can play a part in this i’m not just saying this as some lame encouragement thing because it is true because everyone is a part of the community and everyone can help to make the community a better one2agree with nietzsche — the mods have to play a part as well and be good mods remember that you are not helping anybody by trolling in chat and that you were made a mod here for a reason for once you displayed yourself as a good editor and for another you were seen as a good potential mod — a good potential helper to improve the community so don’t just sit there trolling or whatever get out there and be what you are supposed to be be what whoever modded you wanted you to be be what the community needs you to be a good beneficial modmarch 3rd 2015  in mynamescodys mediator discussion threadmfvoltron congrats for being promoted from whitehat at last 

i know i’m not a mediator but i’m just going to say this

i’m really glad to see that actually because you’re not the only one who has been discouraged by being considered “not worthy to be editor” by others after someone editored you now that we have this mediator role we will have much fewer struggles with deeditoring having more than one option for promotion makes the idea of promotion itself less pressuring for normal users and that’s definitely an improvement in the general direction genius is moving great job people2embed"
