i know the bible isnt perfect
cause it left one person out
there was adam there was eve
and there was someone else around
yeah i think his name was steve
and he was passing through town
when he heard a snake awhispering
to adam in the garden
take the fruit its good for you
steve said i beg your pardon
i know its not my business
but will you just hear me out

prechorus
he said i wouldnt lie
you should not go to that tree
the serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
oh you want what you cant have
but youve got all the things you need
there was adam there was eve and there was steve

chorus
he said adam dont be fooled by the snake
dont risk it all for a taste
oh what a waste
to have everything and give it all away
you might also likeverse 2
adam looked around and as he wrestled with his fate
steve and eve rolled up their sleeves to wrestle with that snake
in the midst of all the chaos
steve was still screaming out

prechorus
he said i wouldnt lie
you should not go to that tree
the serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
oh you want what you cant have
but youve got all the things you need
there was adam there was eve and there was steve

chorus
he said adam dont be fooled by the snake
dont risk it all for a taste
oh what a waste
to have everything and give it all away

bridge
sometimes i feel like adam
cause ive got more than i need
but even when i have it all
i want whats out of reach
maybe i should learn my lesson
like steve was talkin to me
prechorus
he said i wouldnt lie
you should not go to that tree
the serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
oh you want what you cant have
but youve got all the things you need
there was adam there was eve and there was steve

chorus
he said adam dont be fooled by the snake
dont risk it all for a taste
oh what a waste
to have everything and give it all away15embed"
