first time in a while
that everything is fine
id lie to you
been lying to myself all the time

chorus
and your voice
in the back of my head
wishing things could be quiet
and your voice
murdering the silence
consistent like a ritual

verse 2
id stop and stare
imagining that youd be there
id spend my days
wasting my time constantly

chorus
and your voice
in the back of my head
wishing things could be quiet
and your voice
murdering the silence
consistent like a ritual
