verse 1
we came to battle baby
we came to win the war
we won’t surrender till we
get what were looking for
were blowing out our speakers
there goes the neighborhood
a little scissor happy
little misunderstood

prechorus
we can turn you on
or we will turn on you

chorus
daughters of darkness
sisters insane
a little evil goes a long long way
we stand together
no were not afraid
well live forever
daughters of darkness

verse 2
were all survivors somehow
we just broke out the pack
and i dont need no dogtag

prechorus
we can turn you on
or we can turn on you

bridge
never down never out
playing hard living loud
keeping up with the boys
making out making noise
and you better get me home
before the sun comes up up up

a little evil goes a long long way
we stand together
no were not afraid
well live forever
