i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the son of god discloses
and he walks with me

chorus
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

verse 2
id stay in the garden with him
tho the night around me is falling
but he bids me go through the voice of woe
his voice to me is calling

chorus
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

outro
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever knownsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
