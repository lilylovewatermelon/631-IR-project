you fight me
flat on my lonely face i fell
finding in the end i live well
in the light of the life that i have found
its coming down

i dont know what isnt real
but its easy to beat me
suck it in
life is sink or swim
love is blinding
no surviving

i dont know what i want to be yet
but i can show that i need to see this
no time for lies and empty fights
im on your side

prechorus
cant we live a life of peace of happiness
i dont think so
no denying im scared to lose the things i love
im in control

chorus
this is how
this is how its gonna end
this is how
this is how its gonna end
end

chorus
this is how
this is how its gonna end
this is how
this is how its gonna end
