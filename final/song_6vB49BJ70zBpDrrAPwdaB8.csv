verse 1 kanye west
my homie mali used to stay at 79th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet a school full of stones
he nicknamed me krock so theyd leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
back when we rocked ellesses he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers even more by polices
howd he get the cash the day his father passed away
left him with a lil something sixteen he was stuntin
al b sure nigga with the hair all wavy
hit lake shore girls go all crazy
hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
boned so much that summer even had him a baby
see back— back then— then if you had a car
you was the chitown version of baby
and i was just a virgin a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
felt like i was almost signed when the shit got cranked
wed take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had them lincolns and auroras we was hurtin’ em all
with the girls a lot of flirting involved but dawg
fuck all that flirting im tryna get in some drawers
so put me on with these hoes homie
he told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie

drive slow homie
drive slow
you never know homie about these hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
verse 2 paul wall
what it do im posted up in the parking lot my trunk waving
the candy gloss is immaculate its simply amazing
them elbows poking wide on that candy lac
trunk open screens on neons lit with fifth relaxed
im on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
allow me to introduce you to my cl mercedes
its a starstudded event when i valet park
open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
you see them fours crawling you see them screens falling
the disco ball in my mouth insinuates im ballin
im leaning on the switch sitting crooked in my slab
but i could still catch boppers if i drove a cab
a young houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
ridin something candycoated crawling like a caterpillar
im tipping on them fours im jammin’ on this groove
im looking for them hoes baby what it do drive slow homie
chorus kanye west  glc
turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
drive slow homie
if youre riding around the city with nowhere to go
drive slow homie
live today cause tomorrow man you never know
you never know homie might meet some hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
verse 3 glc  kanye west
my cars like the movie my cars like the crib
i got more tvs in here than where i live
and that dont make no sense but baby im the shit
and everything i flip you know its something serious
i got the custom grill i got the brabus rims
i got the baller genetics baby this evidence
you see a player flicking and how you aint convinced
that you should go on and kiss it just a lil bit just a lil bit
i wear my custom kicks i got my jesus chain
my canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
they see me hoes actin like they seen a king
with that mean lean smoking on that finest cali green
my woodgrain oak im riding on vogues
my cylinder quiet like tiptoes
i sold os and this i know
when you see them hoes lil homie drive slow drive slow
