shoplifter youll never learn
when you commit the crime
shoplifter youre getting burned
and now you got to do the time

verse 2
its a 123 on the felony
well not everything is free
now that you serve the community
its the life of a petty thief

chorus
its not considered stealing
unless youre getting caught
but youll be caught stealing
trying to take something you havent got

verse 3
shoplifter youll never learn
what lies behind your back
not a burglar or a bank robber
just some kleptomaniac

its not considered stealing
unless youre getting caught
but youve been caught stealing
trying to take something you havent got
