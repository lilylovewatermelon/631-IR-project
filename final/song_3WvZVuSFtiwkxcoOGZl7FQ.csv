hold me down so i dont leap onto the wall
with the fever of it all
that would encourage mayhem
theyre quite a rowdy crowd do you think
and im going to the peak of something
lovely feeling slippy breathing
tell me how to break the news
theres no way that i can lose my love
and its taken over me

chorus
i feel as if this love could last forever
as if my luck and hope have found each other
i feel as if i should have known together
we make good sense to me and i believe

verse 2
who just said some girls dont get a second chance
when ive toyed and ive romanced
im on the edge of something
inner soothing manapproving
tell me how to take the news
theres no way that i can lose my love
and its taken over me
