new day wet shave
this is a different phase
no shame im dead without her
her veins her face
some things you cant erase
take trains and watch the weather

chorus
this looks nothing like my life really should
shes gone and made somebody else hers
i feel just like im part of a romcom gone wrong

verse 2
she had no mask
nobody understands
thats that goodbye everything
long baths podcasts
im crying when im smashed
haha welcome to grieving

chorus
this looks nothing like my life really should
shes gone and made somebody else hers
i feel just like im part of a romcom gone wrong
see matt maltese liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
and its so hard to really let you be
im just the start of your documentary
these days im gone i go for anything
i think i see you down every fucking street

chorus
this looks nothing like my life really should
shes shacked up with someone really good
i feel just like im part of a romcom gone wrong3embed"
