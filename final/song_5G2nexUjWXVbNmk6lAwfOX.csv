one day i woke up i woke up knowing
today is the day i will die

and enjoyed it one last time
i called my mother told her i loved her
and i begged her not to cry
i wrote a letter i said id miss her
and i signed that goodbye

you know the happiest day of my life
i swear the happiest day of my life is the day that i die

it sets in but its alright the day that i die
darkness falls im letting go the day that i die
all alone but i feel fine the day that i die

we took a drive and we drove through dc
to see the places we lived
long conversations we talked of old friends
and all the things that we did
