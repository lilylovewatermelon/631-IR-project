i see them gathered see them on the shore
i turned to look once more
and he who knows me not
takes me to the belly of darkness

bridge
the tears run swift and hard
and when they fall
even even the comfort of a stone
would be a gain
there was a time when i thought
i would have to give up
but im thankful that im
strong as i am and ill
try to do the best i can

prechorus
tears will run swift
and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that its swift though
tears will fall as cold as pain

chorus
i pray to the almighty
let me not to him do
as he has unto me
teach my beloved children
who have been enslaved
to reach for the light continually

so many times i prayed
so many times ive prayed for you
prayed for you

bridge
the tears run swift and
hard and cold as pain
even even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
had i not had the strength and wisdom of a warrior
i would have to give up
but im thankful that im strong as i am
and ill try to do the best i can

pre chorus
tears will run swift
and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that its swift though
tears will fall as cold as pain

chorus
i pray to the almighty
let us not do as he has unto us
teach my beloved children ive been a slave
but reach for the light continually
outro
wisdom is the flame
wisdom is the brave warrior
who will carry us into the sun
i pray that its swift though
tears will come that fall like rain
so many times so many timesembed"
