no one can see me and
ive lost all feeling and
i know i wont die alone
ill stop you from breathing and all your deceiving and
this house is not my home

prechorus elena siegman
no more forgiveness
no and the reason is i know i wont die alone
i have returned

chorus elena siegman
and everyone dies and everyone lies
theyre waiting for the second coming again
everyone tries to hold onto their lives
when no ones alive
bring me 115

verse 2 elena siegman
you stand for nothing and overlooked something
ill bring you down all on my own
im the end i can taste it ill justify hatred
i am the chosen one left hand of all thats sacred

prechorus elena siegman
no more forgiveness
no ill bring you death and pestilence
ill bring you down on my own
i have returned

and everything dies
look to the skies to see the end of all creation again

when no ones alive

bridge elena siegman
ive lost all form and unity
where has my life gone
ill bring you doom that you can see
and bring you down to see you bleed

chorus elena siegman
and everyone dies and everyone lies
theyre waiting for the second coming again
everyone tries to hold onto their lives
when no ones alive
bring me 115
and everything dies
look to the skies to see the end of all creation again
see with your eyes my army of flies
when no ones alive
bring me 115
and nobody cries when everyone dies
and no ones alive
bring me 11510embed"
