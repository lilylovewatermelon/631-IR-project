i hate gil really now
hate you because
go tippy toe
shut off to the world
shut off to all you go

i barely told a lie
now pray to be blind
and im gone for a while
shut off the world
shut off to all

chorus
im yours
im yours
therell be evil people to say things they show
say once before
i know evil people will say things
they dont know oh

verse 2
i begged gil really why
stay through the night
im here for a while
shut off to the world
shut off to all

said once before
i know evil people will say things
they dont know
