in the present chapter we have not only a striking proof of shakespeares minute acquaintance with natural history but of his remarkable versatility as a writer whilst displaying a most extensive knowledge of ornithology he has further illustrated his subject by alluding to those numerous legends popular sayings and superstitions which have in this and other countries clustered round the feathered race indeed the following pages are alone sufficient to show if it were necessary how fully he appreciated every branch of antiquarian lore and what a diligent student he must have been in the pursuit of that wide range of information the possession of which has made him one of the most manysided writers that the world has ever seen the numerous incidental allusions too by shakspeare to the folklore of bygone days whilst showing how deeply he must have read and gathered knowledge from every available source serve as an additional proof of his retentive memory and marvellous power of embellishing his ideas by the most apposite illustrations unfortunately however these have hitherto been frequently lost sight of through the readers unacquaintance with that extensive field of folklore which was so well known to the poet for the sake of easy reference the birds with which the present chapter deals are arranged alphabetically

barnaclegoose—there was a curious notion very prevalent in former times that this bird anser bernicla was generated from the barnacle leilas anatifera a shellfish growing on a flexible stem and adhering to loose timber bottoms of ships c a metamorphosis to which shakspeare alludes in the tempest iv i where he makes caliban say—

we shall lose our time and all be turn’d to barnacles

this vulgar error no doubt originated in mistaking the fleshy peduncle of the shellfish for the neck of a goose the shell for its head and the tentacula for a tuft of feathers these shellfish therefore bearing as seen out of the water a resemblance to the gooses neck were ignorantly and without investigation confounded with geese themselves in france the barnaclegoose may be eaten on fast days by virtue of this old belief in its fishy origin like other fictions this one had its variations for sometimes the barnacles were supposed to grow on trees and thence to drop into the sea and become geese as in draytons account of furness polyolb 1622 song 27 p 1190 as early as the 12th century this idea was promulgated by giraldus cambrensis in his topographia hiberniæ gerarde who in the year 1597 published his herball or generall historie of plantes narrates the following—there are found in the north parts of scotland and the isles adjacent called orcades certain trees whereon do grow certain shellfishes of a white colour tending to russet wherein are contained little living creatures which shells in time of maturity do open and out of them grow those little living things which falling into the water do become fowls whom we call barnacles in the north of england brant geese and in lancashire tree geese but the others that do fall upon the land perish and do come to nothing thus much of the writings of others and also
from the mouths of people of those parts which may very well accord with truth but what our eyes have seen and hands have touched we shall declare there is a small island in lancashire called the pile of foulders wherein are found the broken pieces of old ships some whereof have been cast thither by shipwreck and also the trunks or bodies with the branches of old rotten trees cast up there likewise whereon is found a certain spume or froth that in time breedeth into certain shells in shape like those of the mussel but sharper pointed and of a whitish colour wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of silk one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell even as the fish of oysters and mussels are the other end is made fast unto the belly of a rude mass or lump which in time cometh to the shape and form of a bird when it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string next come the legs of the bird hanging out and as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by degrees till at length it is all come forth and hangeth only by the bill in short space after it cometh to full maturity and falleth into the sea where it gathereth feathers and groweth to a fowl bigger than a mallard and lesser than a goose having black legs and bill or beak and feathers black and white spotted in such a manner as is our magpie which the people of lancashire call by no other name than a tree goose an interesting cut of these birds so growing is given by mr halliwellphillipps from a manuscript of the 14th century who is of opinion that the barnacle mentioned by caliban was the treegoose it is not to be supposed however that there were none who doubted this marvellous story or who took steps to refute it belon so long ago as 1551 says mr harting and others after him treated it with ridicule and a refutation may be found in willughbys ornithology which was edited by ray in 1678 this vulgar error is mentioned by many of the old writers thus bishop hall in his virgidemiarum lib iv sat 2 says—

the scottish barnacle if i might choose
that of a worme doth waxe a winged goose

butler too in his hudibras iii ii 1 655 speaks of it and marston in his malecontent 1604 has the following—like your scotch barnacle now a block instantly a worm and presently a great goose

blackbird—this favourite is called in the midsummer nights dream iii 1 an ousel old french oisel a term still used in the neighbourhood of leeds—

the ousel cock so black of hue
with orange tawny bill

in the 2d part of king henry iv iii 2 when justice shallow inquires of justice silence and how doth my cousin he is answered—
alas a black ousel cousin shallow a phrase which no doubt corresponded to our modern one a black sheep in spensers epithalamium 1 82 the word occurs—

the ousel shrills the ruddock warbles soft

buzzard—mr staunton suggests that in the following passage of the taming of the shrew ii 1 a play is intended upon the words and that in the second line buzzard means a beetle from its peculiar buzzing noise—

o slowwing’d turtle shall a buzzard take thee
ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard

the beetle was formerly called a buzzard and in staffordshire a cockchafer is termed a humbuz in northamptonshire we find a proverb im between a hawk and a buzzard which means i dont know what to do or how to act

chaffinch—some think that this bird is alluded to in the song in the midsummer nights dream iii 1 where the expression finch is used the chaffinch having always been a favourite cage bird with the lowerclasses in troilus and cressida v 1 thersites calls patroclus a finchegg which was evidently meant as a term of reproach others again consider the phrase is equivalent to coxcomb

chough—in using this word shakespeare probably in most cases meant the jackdaw for in a midsummer nights dream iii 2 he says—

russetpated choughs many in sort
rising and cawing at the guns report

the term russetpated being applicable to the jackdaw but not to the real chough in 1 henry iv v 1 prince henry calls falstaff chewet—peace chewet peace—in allusion no doubt to the chough or jackdaw for common birds have always had a variety of names  such an appellation would be a proper reproach to falstaff for his meddling and impertinent talk steevens and malone however finding that chewets were little round pies made of minced meat thought that the prince compared falstaff for his unseasonable chattering to a minced pie cotgrave  describes the french chouette as an owlet also a chough which many consider to be the simple and satisfactory explanation of chewet belon in his history of birds paris 1855 speaks of the chouette as the smallest kind of chough or crow again in 1 henry iv ii 2 in the amusing scene where falstaff with the prince and poins meet to rob the travellers at gadshill falstaff calls the victims fat chuffs probably says mr harting who connects the word with chough from their strutting about with much noise nares too in his explanation of chuff says that some suppose it to be from chough which is similarly pronounced and means a kind of seabird generally esteemed a stupid one various other meanings are given thus mr gifford affirms that chuff is always used in a bad sense and means a coarse unmannered clown at once sordid and wealthy and mr halliwellphillipps explains it as spoken in contempt for a fat person in northamptonshire we find the word chuff used to denote a person in good condition as in clares village minstrel—

his chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile

shakespeare alludes to the practice of teaching choughs to talk although from the following passages he does not appear to have esteemed their talking powers of much value for in alls well that ends well iv 1 he says—

choughs’ language gabble enough and good enough
and in tempest ii 1 he represents antonio as saying—
there be that can rule naples
as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily
as this gonzalo i myself could make
a chough of as deep chat

shakespeare always refers to the jackdaw as the daw the chough or jackdaw was one of the birds considered ominous by our forefathers an allusion to which occurs in macbeth iii 4—

augurs and understood relations have
by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secret’st man of blood

at the present day this bird is not without its folklore and there is a norwich rhyme to the following effect —

when three daws are seen on st peters vane together
then were sure to have bad weather

in the north too of england the flight of jackdaws down the chimney is held to presage death

cock—the beautiful notion which represents the cock as crowing all night long on christmas eve and by its vigilance dispelling every kind of malignant spirit and evil influence is graphically mentioned in hamlet i 1 where marcellus speaking of the ghost says—

it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever gainst that season comes
wherein our saviours birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallow’d and so gracious is the time
in short there is a complete prostration of the powers of darkness and thus for the time being mankind is said to be released from the influence of all those evil forces which otherwise exert such sway the notion that spirits fly at cockcrow is very ancient and is mentioned by the christian poet prudentius who flourished in the beginning of the fourth century there is also a hymn said to have been composed by st ambrose and formerly used in the salisbury service which so much resembles the following speech of horatio i 1 that one might almost suppose shakespeare had seen it —

the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine

this disappearance of spirits at cockcrow is further alluded to i 2—

the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish’d from our sight

blair too in his grave has these graphic words—

the tale
of horrid apparition tall and ghastly
that walks at dead of night or takes his stand
o’er some newopen’d grave and strange to tell
evanishes at crowing of the cock

this superstition has not entirely died out in england and a correspondent of notes and queries relates an amusing legend current in devonshire—mr n was a squire who had been so unfortunate as to sell his soul to the devil with the condition that after his funeral the fiend should take possession of his skin he had also persuaded a neighbour to be present on the occasion of the flaying on the death of mr n this man went in a state of great alarm to the parson of the parish and asked his advice by him he was told to fulfil his engagement but he must be sure and carry a cock into the church with him on the night after the funeral the man proceeded to the church armed with the cock and as an additional security took up his position in the parsons pew at twelve oclock the devil arrived opened the grave took the corpse from the coffin and flayed it when the operation was concluded he held the skin up before him and remarked well ’twas not worth coming for after all for it is all full of holes as he said this the cock crew whereupon the fiend turning round to the man exclaimed if it had not been for the bird you have got there under your arm i would have your skin too but thanks to the cock the man got home safe again various origins have been assigned to this superstition which hampson 2 regards as a misunderstood tradition of some sabæan fable the cock he adds which seems by its early voice to call forth the sun was esteemed a sacred solar bird hence it was also sacred to mercury one of the personifications of the sun

a very general amusement up to the end of the last century was cockfighting a diversion of which mention is occasionally made by shakespeare as in antony and cleopatra ii 3—

his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought

and again hamlet says v 2—

o i die horatio
the potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit

—meaning the poison triumphs over him as a cock over his beaten antagonist formerly cockfighting entered into the occupations of the old and young schools had their cockfights travellers agreed with coachmen that they were to wait a night if there was a cockfight in any town through which they passed when country gentlemen had sat long at table and the conversation had turned upon the relative merits of their several birds a cockfight often resulted as the birds in question were brought for the purpose into the diningroom cockfighting was practised on shrove tuesday to a great extent and in the time of henry vii seems to have been practised within the precincts of court the earliest mention of this pastime in england is by fitzstephens in 1191 happily nowadays cockfighting is by law a misdemeanour and punishable by penalty one of the popular terms for a cock beaten in a fight was a craven to which we find a reference in the taming of the shrew ii 1—no cock of mine you crow too like a craven we may also compare the expression in henry v iv 7—he is a craven and a villain else in the old appeal or wager of battle in our common law we are told on the authority of lord coke that the party who confessed himself wrong or refused to fight was to pronounce the word cravent and judgment was at once given against him singer 3 says the term may be satisfactorily traced from crant créant the old french word for an act of submission it is so written in the old metrical romance of ywaine and gawaine ritson i 133—

or yelde the til us als creant
and in richard coeur de lion weber ii 208—

on knees he fel down and cryde crêaunt
it then became cravant cravent and at length craven


in the time of shakespeare the word cock was used as a vulgar corruption or purposed disguise of the name of god an instance of which occurs in hamlet iv 5—by cock they are to blame this irreverent alteration of the sacred name is found at least a dozen times in heywoods edward the fourth where one passage is—

herald—sweare on this booke king lewis so help you god
you mean no otherwise then you have said
king lewis—so helpe me cock as i dissemble not

we find too other allusions to the sacred name as in cockspassion cocksbody as in taming of the shrew iv i—cocks passion silence a not uncommon oath too in shakespeares time was cock and pie—cock referring to god and pie being supposed to mean the servicebook of the romish church a meaning which says mr dyce seems much more probable than douces supposition that this oath was connected with the making of solemn vows by knights in the days of chivalry during entertainments at which a roasted peacock was served up it is used by justice shallow 2 henry iv v 1—by cock and pye sir you shall not away tonight we may also compare the expression in the old play of soliman and perseda 1599—by cock and pye and mousefoot mr harting  says the cock and pye ie magpie was an ordinary alehouse sign and may have thus become a subject for the vulgar to swear by

the phrase cockahoop which occurs in romeo and juliet i 5—

youll make a mutiny among my guests
you will set cockahoop youll be the man

—no doubt refers to a reckless person who takes the cock or tap out of a cask and lays it on the top or hoop of the barrel thus letting all the contents of the cask run out formerly a quart pot was called a hoop being formed of staves bound together with hoops like barrels there were generally three hoops to such a pot hence in 2 henry vi iv 2 one of jack cades popular reformations was to increase their number the threehooped pot shall have ten hoops and i will make it felony to drink small beer some however consider the term cockahoop  refers to the boastful crowing of the cock

in king lear iii 2 shakespeare speaks of the cataracts and hurricanoes as having—

drenched our steeples drowned the cocks

vanes on the tops of steeples were in days gone by made in the form of a cock—hence weathercocks—and put up in papal times to remind the clergy of watchfulness apart too from symbolism the large tail of the cock was well adapted to turn with the wind

cormorant—the proverbial voracity of this bird gave rise to a man of large appetite being likened to it a sense in which shakespeare employs the word as in coriolanus i 1—the cormorant belly in loves labours lost i 1—cormorant devouring time and in troilus and cressida ii 2—this cormorant war although says mr harting  shakespeare mentions the cormorant in several of his plays he has nowhere alluded to the sport of using these birds when trained for fishing a fact which is singular since he often speaks of the then popular pastime of hawking and he did not die until some years after james i had made fishing with cormorants a fashionable amusement

crow—this has from the earliest times been reckoned a bird of bad omen and in julius cæsar v 1 cassius on the eve of battle predicted a defeat because to use his own words—

crows and kites
fly o’er our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal under which
our army lies ready to give up the ghost

allusions to the same superstition occur in troilus and cressida i 2 king john v 2 etc virgil bucolic i 18 mentions the croaking of the crow as a bad omen—

sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice cornix
and butler in his hudibras part ii canto 3 remarks—

is it not ominous in all countries
when crows and ravens croak upon trees

even children nowadays regard with no friendly feelings this bird of illomen 1 and in the north of england there is a rhyme to the following effect—

crow crow get out of my sight
or else ill eat thy liver and lights

among other allusions mentioned by shakspeare to the crow may be noticed the crowkeeper—a person employed to drive away crows from the fields at present in all the midland counties a boy set to drive away the birds is said to keep birds hence a stuffed figure now called a scarecrow was also called a crowkeeper as in king lear iv 6—

that fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper
one of tussers directions for september is—

no sooner asowing but out byandby
with mother or boy that alarum can cry
and let them be armed with a sling or a bow
to scare away pigeon the rook or the crow

in romeo and juliet i 4 a scarecrow seems meant—

bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper

among further references to this practice is that in 1 henry vi i 4 where lord talbot relates that when a prisoner in france he was publicly exhibited in the marketplace—

here said they is the terror of the french
the scarecrow that affrights our children so
and once more in measure for measure ii 1—

we must not make a scarecrow of the law
setting it up to fear the birds of prey
and let it keep one shape till custom make it
their perch and not their terror

the phrase to pluck a crow is to complain goodnaturedly but reproachfully and to threaten retaliation it occurs in comedy of errors iii 1—well pluck a crow together sometimes the word pull is substituted for pluck as in butlers hudibras part ii canto 2—

if not resolve before we go
that you and i must pull a crow

the crow has been regarded as the emblem of darkness which has not escaped the notice of shakspeare who in pericles iv introd speaking of the white dove says—

with the dove of paphos might the crow
vie feathers white

cuckoo—many superstitions have clustered round the cuckoo and both in this country and abroad it is looked upon as a mysterious bird being supposed to possess the gift of second sight a notion referred to in loves labours lost v 2—

cuckoo cuckoo  o word of fear
unpleasing to a married ear

and again in midsummer nights dream iii 1 bottom sings—

the plainsong cuckoo gray
whose note full many a man doth mark
and dares not answer nay


it is still a common idea that the cuckoo if asked will tell anyone by the repetition of its cries how long he has to live the country lasses in sweden count the cuckoos call to ascertain how many years they have to remain unmarried but they generally shut their ears and run away on hearing it a few times  among the germans the notes of the cuckoo when heard in spring for the first time are considered a good omen cæsarius ad 1222 tells us of a convertite who was about to become a monk but changed his mind on hearing the cuckoos call and counting twentytwo repetitions of it come said he i have certainly twentytwo years still to live and why should i mortify myself during all that time i will go back to the world enjoy its delights for twenty years and devote the remaining two to penitence  in england the peasantry salute the cuckoo with the following invocation—

cuckoo cherrytree
good bird tell me
how many years have i to live

the allusion to the cherrytree having probably originated in the popular fancy that before the cuckoo ceases its song it must eat three good meals of cherries pliny mentions the belief that when the cuckoo came to maturity it devoured the bird which had reared it a superstition several times alluded to by shakespeare thus in king lear i 4 the fool remarks—

the hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
that its had it head bit off by it young

again in 1 henry iv v 1 worcester says—

and being fed by us you used us so
as that ungentle gull the cuckoos bird
useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
that even our love durst not come near your sight
for fear of swallowing

once more the opinion that the cuckoo made no nest of its own but laid its eggs in that of another bird is mentioned in antony and cleopatra ii 6—

thou dost o’ercount me of my fathers house
but since the cuckoo builds not for himself
remain in’t as thou mayst

it has been remarked however in reference to the common idea that the young cuckoo illtreats its foster mother that if we watch the movements of the two birds when the younger is being fed we cannot much wonder at this piece of folklore when the cuckoo opens its great mouth the diminutive nurse places her own head so far within its precincts that it has the exact appearance of a voluntary surrender to decapitation

the notion which couples the name of the cuckoo with the character of the man whose wife is unfaithful to him appears to have been derived from the romans and is first found in the middle ages in france and in the countries of which the modern language is derived from the latin but the ancients more correctly gave the name of the bird not to the husband of the faithless wife but to her paramour who might justly be supposed to be acting the part of the cuckoo they applied the name of the bird in whose nest the cuckoos eggs were usually deposited—carruca—to the husband it is not quite clear how in the passage from classic to mediæval the application of the term was transferred to the husband in further allusion to this bird we may quote the following from alls well that ends well i 3—

for i the ballad will repeat
which men full true will find
your marriage comes by destiny
your cuckoo sings by kind

the cuckoo has generally been regarded as the harbinger of spring and according to a gloucestershire rhyme—

the cuckoo comes in april
sings a song in may
then in june another tune
and then she flies away

thus in 1 henry iv iii 2 henry iv alluding to his predecessor says—

so when he had occasion to be seen
he was but as the cuckoo is in june
heard not regarded

in loves labours lost v 2 spring is maintained by the cuckoo in those charming sonnets descriptive of the beauties of the country at this season

the word cuckoo has from the earliest times been used as a term of reproach and plautus has introduced it on more than one occasion in this sense we find it quoted by shakespeare in 1 henry iv ii 4—o’ horseback ye cuckoo the term cuckold too which so frequently occurs throughout shakespeares plays is generally derived from cuculus from the practice already alluded to of depositing its eggs in other birds’ nests

domestic fowl—in the tempest v 1 the word chick is used as a term of endearment nay arise chick c and in macbeth iv 3 macduff speaks of his children as all my pretty chickens in coriolanus v 3 hen is applied to a woman—poor hen fond of no second brood and in taming of the shrew ii 1 petruchio says so kate will be my hen and once more 1 henry iv iii 3 falstaff says how now dame partlet the hen in othello i 3 iago applies the term guineahen to desdemona a cant phrase in shakespeares day for a fast woman

dove—among the many beautiful allusions to this bird we may mention one in hamlet v 1 where shakespeare speaks of the dove only laying two eggs

as patient as the female dove
when that her golden couplets are disclosed

the young nestlings when first disclosed are only covered with a yellow down and the mother rarely leaves the nest in consequence of the tenderness of her young hence the dove has been made an emblem of patience in 2 henry iv iv 1 it is spoken of as the symbol of peace—the dove and very blessed spirit of peace and in the taming of the shrew ii 1 we find the expression as modest as the dove its love too is several times referred to as in romeo ii 1 pronounce but—love and dove and in 1 henry vi ii 2 burgundy says—

like to a pair of loving turtledoves
that could not live asunder day or night
this bird has also been regarded as the emblem of fidelity as in the following graphic passage in troilus and cressida iii 2—

as true as steel as plantage to the moon
as sun to day as turtle to her mate
as iron to adamant as earth to the centre

and in winters tale iv 4 we read—turtles pair that never mean to part its modesty is alluded to in the taming of the shrew ii 1—modest as the dove and its innocence in 2 henry vi iii 1 is mentioned where king henry says—

our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall

the custom of giving a pair of doves or pigeons as a present or peaceoffering is alluded to in titus andronicus iv 4 where the clown says god and saint stephen give you good den i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here and when gobbo tried to find favour with bassanio in merchant of venice ii 2 he began by saying—i have here a dish of doves that i would bestow on your worship shakespeare alludes in several places to the doves of venus as in venus and adonis—

thus weary of the world away she venus hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is conveyed
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen


and in a midsummer nights dream i 1 where hermia speaks of the simplicity of venus’ doves this will also explain says mr harting the reference to the dove of paphos in pericles iv introduction the towns of old and new paphos are situated on the southwest extremity of the coast of cyprus old paphos is the one generally referred to by the poets being the peculiar seat of the worship of venus who was fabled to have been wafted thither after her birth amid the waves the dove of paphos may therefore be considered as synonymous with the dove of venus

mahomet we are told had a dove which he used to feed with wheat out of his ear when hungry the dove lighted on his shoulder and thrust its bill in to find its breakfast—mahomet persuading the rude and simple arabians that it was the holy ghost that gave him advice hence in 1 henry vi i 2 the question is asked—

was mahomet inspired with a dove

duck—a barbarous pastime in shakespeares time was hunting a tame duck in the water with spaniels for the performance of this amusement it was necessary to have recourse to a pond of water sufficiently extensive to give the duck plenty of room for making its escape from the dogs when closely pursued which it did by diving as often as any of them came near it hence the following allusion in henry v ii 3—

and holdfast is the only dog my duck

to swim like a duck is a common proverb which occurs in the tempest ii 2 where trinculo in reply to stephanos question how he escaped says swum ashore man like a duck i can swim like a duck ill be sworn

eagle—from the earliest time this bird has been associated with numerous popular fancies and superstitions many of which have not escaped the notice of shakspeare a notion of very great antiquity attributes to it the power of gazing at the sun undazzled to which spenser in his hymn of heavenly beauty refers—

and like the native brood of eagles kind
on that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes

in loves labours lost iv 3 biron says of rosaline—

what peremptory eaglesighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow
that is not blinded by her majesty

and in 3 henry vi ii 1 richard says to edward prince of wales—

nay if thou be that princely eagles bird
show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun

the french naturalist lacepede has calculated that the clearness of vision in birds is nine times more extensive than that of the farthestsighted man the eagle too has always been proverbial for its great power of flight and on this account has had assigned to it the sovereignty of the feathered race aristotle and pliny both record the legend of the wren disputing for the crown a tradition which is still found in ireland —the birds all met together one day and settled among themselves that whichever of them could fly highest was to be the king of them all well just as they were starting the little rogue of a wren perched itself on the eagles tail so they flew and flew ever so high till the eagle was miles above all the rest and could not fly another stroke for he was so tired then says he im the king of the birds says he hurroo you lie says the wren darting up a perch and ahalf above the big fellow the eagle was so angry to think how he was outwitted by the wren that when the latter was coming down he gave him a stroke of his wing and from that day the wren has never been able to fly higher than a hawthorn bush the swiftness of the eagles flight is spoken of in timon of athens i 1—

an eagle flight bold and forth on
leaving no track behind

the great age too of the eagle is well known and the words of the psalmist are familiar to most readers—

his youth shall be renewed like the eagles

apemantus however asks of timon timon of athens iv 3—

will these moss’d trees
that have outlived the eagle page thy heels
and skip where thou point’st out

tuberville in his book of falconry 1575 says that the great age of this bird has been ascertained from the circumstance of its always building its eyrie or nest in the same place the romans considered the eagle a bird of good omen and its presence in time of battle was supposed to foretell victory thus in julius cæsar v 1 we read—

coming from sardis on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell and there they perch’d
gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands

it was selected for the roman legionary standard through being the king and most powerful of all birds as a bird of good omen it is mentioned also in cymbeline i 1—

i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock
and in another scene iv 2 the soothsayer relates how last night the very gods shew’d me a vision thus—

i saw joves bird the roman eagle wing’d
from the spongy south to this part of the west
there vanish’d in the sunbeams which portends
unless my sins abuse my divination
success to th’ roman host

the conscious superiority of the eagle is depicted by tamora in titus andronicus iv 4—

the eagle suffers little birds to sing
and is not careful what they mean thereby
knowing that with the shadow of his wing
he can at pleasure stint their melody


goose—this bird was the subject of many quaint proverbial phrases often used in the old popular writers thus a tailors goose was a jocular name for his pressing iron probably from its being often roasting before the fire an allusion to which occurs in macbeth ii 3—

come in tailor here you may roast your goose

the wildgoose chase which is mentioned in romeo and juliet ii 4—

mercutio—nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have done

—was a kind of horserace which resembled the flight of wildgeese two horses were started together and whichever rider could get the lead the other was obliged to follow him over whatever ground the foremost jockey chose to go that horse which could distance the other won the race this reckless sport is enumerated by burton in his anatomy of melancholy as a recreation much in vogue in his time among gentlemen the term winchester goose was a cant phrase for a certain venereal disease because the stews in southwark were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of winchester to whom gloucester tauntingly applies the term in the following passage 1 henry vi i 3—

winchester goose i cry a rope a rope

in troilus and cressida v 10 there is a further allusion—

some galled goose of winchester would hiss

ben jonson  calls it—

the winchestrian goose
bred on the banke in time of popery
when venus there maintain’d the mystery

plucking geese was formerly a barbarous sport of boys merry wives of windsor v 1 which consisted in stripping a living goose of its feathers

in coriolanus i 4 the goose is spoken of as the emblem of cowardice marcius says—

you souls of geese
that hear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat

goldfinch—the warwickshire name for this bird is proud tailor to which some commentators think the words in 1 henry iv iii 1 refer

lady p—i will not sing
hotsp—’tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher

it has therefore been suggested that the passage should be read thus—’tis the next way to turn tailor or redbreast teacher ie to turn teacher of goldfinches or redbreasts 2 singer 3 however explains the words thus—tailors like weavers have ever been remarkable for their vocal skill percy is jocular in his mode of persuading his wife to sing and this is a humorous turn which he gives to his argument come sing i will not sing ’tis the next ie the readiest nearest way to turn tailor or redbreast teacher—the meaning being to sing is to put yourself upon a level with tailors and teachers of birds

gull—shakespeare often uses this word as synonymous with fool thus in henry v iii 6 he says—

why ’tis a gull a fool
the same play upon the word occurs in othello v 2 and in timon of athens ii 1 in twelfth night v 1 malvolio asks—

why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d
kept in a dark house visited by the priest
and made the most notorious geck and gull
that e’er invention played on tell me why

it is also used to express a trick or imposition as in much ado about nothing ii 3—i should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it 1 gullcatchers or gullgropers to which reference is made in twelfth nightii 5 where fabian on the entry of maria exclaims—

here comes my noble gullcatcher

were the names by which sharpers were known in shakespeares time  the gullcatcher was generally an old usurer who lent money to a gallant at an ordinary who had been unfortunate in play 4 decker devotes a chapter to this character in his lanthorne and candlelight 1612 according to him the gullgroper is commonly an old monymonger who having travailed through all the follyes of the world in his youth knowes them well and shunnes them in his age his whole felicitie being to fill his bags with golde and silver the person so duped was termed a gull and the trick also in that disputed passage in the tempest ii 2 where caliban addressing trinculo says—

sometimes ill get thee
young scamels from the rock

some think that the seamew or seagull is intended seamall or seamell being still a provincial name for this bird mr stevenson in his birds of norfolk ii p 260 tells us that the female bartailed godwit is called a scammell by the gunners of blakeney but as this bird is not a rockbreeder 6 it cannot be the one intended in the present passage if we regard it as an accurate description from a naturalists point of view holt says that scam is a limpet and scamell probably a diminutive mr dyce 7 reads scamels ie the kestrel stannel or windhover which breeds in rocky situations and high cliffs on our coasts he also further observes that this accords well with the context from the rock and adds that staniel or staunyel occurs in twelfth night ii 5 where all the old editions exhibit the gross misprint stallion

hawk—the diversion of catching game with hawks was very popular in shakespeares time and hence as might be expected we find many scattered allusions to it throughout his plays the training of a hawk for the field was an essential part of the education of a young saxon nobleman and the present of a welltrained hawk was a gift to be welcomed by a king edward the confessor spent much of his leisure time in either hunting or hawking and in the reign of edward iii we read how the bishop of ely attended the service of the church at bermondsey southwark leaving his hawk in the cloister which in the meantime was stolen—the bishop solemnly excommunicating the thieves on one occasion henry viii met with a serious accident when pursuing his hawk at hitchin in hertfordshire in jumping over a ditch his pole broke and he fell headlong into the muddywater where he was with some difficulty rescued by one of his followers sir thomas moore writing in the reign of henry viii describing the state of manhood makes a young man say—

manhod i am therefore i me delyght
to hunt and hawke to nourish up and fede
the greyhounde to the course the hawke to th’ flight
and to bestryde a good and lusty stede

in noticing then shakespeares allusions to this sport we have a good insight into its various features and also gain a knowledge of the several terms associated with it thus frequent mention is made of the word haggard—a wild untrained hawk—and in the following allegory taming of the shrew iv 1 where it occurs much of the knowledge of falconry is comprised—

my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged

for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard
to make her come and know her keepers call
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not

further allusions occur in twelfth night iii 1 where viola says of the clown—

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
and to do that well craves a kind of wit
he must observe their mood on whom he jests
the quality of persons and the time
and like the haggard check at every feather
that comes before his eye

in much ado about nothing hero iii 1 speaking of beatrice says that—

her spirits are as coy and wild
as haggerds of the rock

and othello iii 3 mistrusting desdemona and likening her to a hawk exclaims—

if i do prove her haggard—
i’ld whistle her off

the word check alluded to above was a term in falconry applied to a hawk when she forsook her proper game and followed some other of inferior kind that crossed her in her flight 3—being mentioned again in hamlet iv 7 where the king says—

if he be now return’d
as checking at his voyage


another common expression used in falconry is tower applied to certain hawks etc which tower aloft soar spirally to a height in the air and thence swoop upon their prey in macbeth ii 4 we read of a falcon towering in her pride of place in 2 henry vi ii 1 suffolk says my lord protectors hawks do tower so well and in king john v 2 the bastard says and like an eagle o’er his aery 1 towers

the word quarry which occurs several times in shakespeares plays in some instances means the game or prey sought the etymology has says nares been variously attempted but with little success it may perhaps originally have meant the square or inclosure carrée into which the game was driven as is still practised in other countries and hence the application of it to the game there caught would be a natural extension of the term randle holme in his academy of armory book ii c xi p 240 defines it as the fowl which the hawk flyeth at whether dead or alive it was also equivalent to a heap of slaughtered game as in the following passages in coriolanus i 1 caius marcius says—i’ld make a quarry with thousands of these quarter’d slaves in macbeth iv 3 2 we read the quarry of these murder’d deer and in hamlet v 2 this quarry cries on havoc

another term in falconry is stoop or swoop denoting the hawks violent descent from a height upon its prey in taming of the shrew iv 1 the expression occurs till she stoop she must not be fullgorged in henry v iv 1 king henry speaking of the king says though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing in macbeth too iv 3 macduff referring to the cruel murder of his children exclaims what at one fell swoop 1 webster in the white devil 2 says—

if she ie fortune give aught she deals it in small parcels
that she may take away all at one swoop

shakespeare gives many incidental allusions to the hawks trappings thus in lucreece he says—

harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcons bells

and in as you like it iii 3  touchstone says as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires the object of these bells was to lead the falconer to the hawk when in a wood or out of sight in heywoods play entitled a woman killed with kindness 1617 is a hawking scene containing a striking allusion to the hawks bells the dress of the hawk consisted of a closefitting hood of leather or velvet enriched with needlework and surmounted with a tuft of coloured feathers for use as well as ornament inasmuch as they assisted the hand in removing the hood when the birds for the hawks attack came in sight thus in henry v iii 7 the constable of france referring to the valour of the dauphin says ’tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate 5 and again in romeo and juliet iii 2 juliet says—

hood my unmann’d blood bating 6 in my cheeks

the jesses were two short straps of leather or silk which were fastened to each leg of a hawk to which was attached a swivel from which depended the leash or strap which the falconer 1 twisted round his hand othello iii 3 says

though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings

we find several allusions to the training of hawks they were usually trained by being kept from sleep it having been customary for the falconers to sit up by turns and watch the hawk and keep it from sleeping sometimes for three successive nights desdemona in othello iii 3 says—

my lord shall never rest
ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience
his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
ill intermingle every thing he does
with cassios suit

so in cartwrights lady errant ii 2—

well keep you as they do hawks
watching until you leave your wildness

in the merry wives of windsor v 5 where page says

nay do not fly i think we have watch’d you now

the allusion is says staunton to this method employed to tame or reclaim hawks

again in othello iii 3 3 iago exclaims—

she that so young could give out such a seeming
to seel her fathers eyes up close as oak

in allusion to the practice of seeling a hawk or sewing up its eyelids by running a fine thread through them in order to make her tractable and endure the hood of which we have already spoken henry iv 2 henry iv iii 1 in his soliloquy on sleep says—

wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains
in cradle of the rude imperious surge


in spensers fairie queen i vii 23 we read—

mine eyes no more on vanity shall feed
but sealed up with death shall have their deadly meed
it was a common notion that if a dove was let loose with its eyes so closed it would fly straight upwards continuing to mount till it fell down through mere exhaustion

in cymbeline iii 4 imogen referring to posthumus says—

i grieve myself
to think when thou shall be disedged by her
that now thou tirest on

this passage containing two metaphorical expressions from falconry a bird was said to be disedged when the keenness of its appetite was taken away by tiring or feeding upon some tough or hard substance given to it for that purpose in 3 henry vi i 1 the king says—

that hateful duke
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son

in timon of athens iii 6 one of the lords says—

upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered
in venus and adonis too we find a further allusion—

even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone c

among other allusions to the hawk may be mentioned one in measure for measure iii i—

this outwardsainted deputy
whose settled visage and deliberate word
nips youth i’ th’ head and follies doth emmew
as falcon doth the fowl

—the word emmew signifying the place where hawks were shut up during the time they moulted in romeo and juliet iii 4 lady capulet says of juliet—tonight she is mew’d up to her heaviness and in taming of shrew i 1 gremio speaking of bianca to signor baptista says—why will you mew her



when the wing or tail feathers of a hawk were dropped forced out or broken by any accident it was usual to supply or repair as many as were deficient or damaged an operation called to imp 1 a hawk thus in richard ii ii 1 northumberland says—

if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
imp out our drooping countrys broken wing
so massinger in his renegado v 8 makes asambeg say—

strive to imp
new feathers to the broken wings of time

hawking was sometimes called birding in the merry wives of windsor iii 3 master page says—i do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast after well abirding together i have a fine hawk for the bush in the same play iii 5 dame quickly speaking of mistress ford says—her husband goes this morning abirding and mistress ford says iv 2—hes abirding sweet st john the word hawk says mr harting is invariably used by shakspeare in its generic sense and in only two instances does he allude to a particular species these are the kestrel and sparrowhawk in twelfth night ii 5 sir toby belch speaking of malvolio as he finds the letter which maria has purposely dropped in his path says

and with what wing the staniel checks at it

—staniel being a corruption of stangdall a name for the kestrel hawk gouts is the technical term for the spots on some parts of the plumage of a hawk and perhaps shakspeare uses the word in allusion to a phrase in heraldry macbeth ii 1 speaking of the dagger says—i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood

heron—this bird was frequently flown at by falconers shakespeare in hamlet ii 2 makes hamlet say i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw handsaw being a corruption of heronshaw or hernsew which is still used in the provincial dialects for a heron in suffolk and norfolk it is pronounced harnsa from which to handsaw is but a single step shakespeare here alludes to a proverbial saying he knows not a hawk from a handsaw  mr j c heath explains the passage thus the expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking most birds especially one of heavy flight like the heron when roused by the falconer or his dog would fly down or with the wind in order to escape when the wind is from the north the heron flies towards the south and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun and be unable to distinguish the hawk from the heron on the other hand when the wind is southerly the heron flies towards the north and it and the pursuing hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman who then has his back to the sun and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew

jay—from its gay and gaudy plumage this bird has been used for a loose woman as merry wives of windsor iii 3—

well teach him to know turtles from jays
ie to distinguish honest women from loose ones again in cymbeline iii 4 imogen says—

some jay of italy
whose mother was her painting hath betray’d him

kestrel—a hawk 5 of a base unserviceable breed and therefore used by spenser in his faerie queen ii iii 4 to signify base

ne thought of honour ever did assay
his baser breast but in his kestrell kynd
a pleasant veine of glory he did fynd

by some it is derived from coystril a knave or peasant from being the hawk formerly used by persons of inferior rank thus in twelfth night i 3 we find coystrill and in pericles iv 6 coystrel the name kestrel says singer for an inferior kind of hawk was evidently a corruption of the french quercelle or quercerelle and originally had no connection with coystril though in later times they may have been confounded holinshed 3 classes coisterels with lacqueys and women the unwarlike attendants on an army the term was also given as a nickname to the emissaries employed by the kings of england in their french wars dyce also considers kestrel distinct from coistrel

kingfisher—it was a common belief in days gone by that during the days the halcyon or kingfisher was engaged in hatching her eggs the sea remained so calm that the sailor might venture upon it without incurring risk of storm or tempest hence this period was called by pliny and aristotle the halcyon days to which allusion is made in 1 henry vi i 2—

expect st martins summer halcyon days
dryden also refers to this notion—

amidst our arms as quiet you shall be
as halcyons brooding on a winters sea

another superstition connected with this bird occurs in king lear ii 1 where the earl of kent says—

turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters

the prevalent idea being that a dead kingfisher suspended from a cord would always turn its beak in that direction from whence the wind blew marlow in his jew of malta i 1 says—

but now how stands the wind
into what corner peers my halcyons bill

occasionally one may still see this bird hung up in cottages a remnant no doubt of this old superstition


kite—this bird was considered by the ancients to be unlucky in julius cæsar v 1 cassius says—

ravens crows and kites
fly o’er our heads and downward look on us

in cymbeline too i 2 imogen says—

i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock

puttock here being a synonym sometimes applied to the kite formerly the kite became a term of reproach from its ignoble habits thus in antony and cleopatra iii 13 antony exclaims you kite and king lear i 4 says to goneril detested kite thou liest its intractable disposition is alluded to in taming of the shrew by petruchio iv 1 a curious peculiarity of this bird is noticed in winters tale iv 3 where autolycus says—my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen—meaning that his practice was to steal sheets leaving the smaller linen to be carried away by the kites who will occasionally carry it off to line their nests mr dyce quotes the following remarks of mr peck on this passage—autolycus here gives us to understand that he is a thief of the first class this he explains by an allusion to an odd vulgar notion the common people many of them think that if anyone can find a kites nest when she hath young before they are fledged and sew up their back doors so as they cannot mute the mother kite in compassion to their distress will steal lesser linen as caps cravats ruffles or any other such small matters as she can best fly with from off the hedges where they are hanged to dry after washing and carry them to her nest and there leave them if possible to move the pity of the first corner to cut the thread and ease them of their misery

lapwing—several interesting allusions are made by shakespeare to this eccentric bird it was a common notion that the young lapwings ran out of the shell with part of it sticking on their heads in such haste were they to be hatched horatio hamlet v 2 says of osric—

this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head


it was therefore regarded as the symbol of a forward fellow webster in the white devil 1859 p 13—

forward lapwing
he flies with the shell on’s head

the lapwing like the partridge is also said to draw pursuers from her nest by fluttering along the ground in an opposite direction or by crying in other places thus in the comedy of errors iv 2 shakespeare says—

far from her nest the lapwing cries away

again in measure for measure i 4 lucio exclaims—

though ’tis my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
tongue far from heart

once more in much ado about nothing iii 1 we read—

for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
close by the ground to hear our conference

several too of our older poets refer to this peculiarity in ben jonsons underwoods lviii we are told—

where he that knows will like a lapwing fly
farre from the nest and so himself belie

through thus alluring intruders from its nest the lapwing became a symbol of insincerity and hence originated the proverb the lapwing cries tongue from heart or the lapwing cries most farthest from her nest

lark—shakespeare has bequeathed to us many exquisite passages referring to the lark full of the most sublime pathos and lofty conceptions most readers are doubtless acquainted with that superb song in cymbeline ii 3 where this sweet songster is represented as singing at heavens gate and again as the bird of dawn it is described in venus and adonis thus—

lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty

in loves labours lost v 2 song we have a graphic touch of pastoral life—

when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
and merry larks are ploughmens clocks

the words of portia too in merchant of venice v 1 to sing as sweetly as the lark have long ago passed into a proverb

it was formerly a current saying that the lark and toad changed eyes to which juliet refers in romeo and juliet iii 5—

some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes

warburton says this popular fancy originated in the toad having very fine eyes and the lark very ugly ones this tradition was formerly expressed in a rustic rhyme—

to heav’n i’d fly
but that the toad beguil’d me of mine eye

in henry viii iii 2 the earl of surrey in denouncing wolsey alludes to a curious method of capturing larks which was effected by small mirrors and red cloth these scaring the birds made them crouch while the fowler drew his nets over them—

let his grace go forward
and dare us with his cap like larks

in this case the cap was the scarlet hat of the cardinal which it was intended to use as a piece of red cloth the same idea occurs in skeltons why come ye not to court a satire on wolsey—

the red hat with his lure
bringeth all things under cure

the words tirralyra winters tale iv 3 are a fanciful combination of sounds meant to imitate the larks note borrowed says nares from the french tirelire browne british pastorals bk i song 4 makes it teeryleery in one of the coventry pageants there is the following old song sung by the shepherds at the birth of christ which contains the expression—

as i out rode this endenes night
of three joli shepherds i sawe a syght
and all aboute there fold a stare shone bright
they sang terli terlow
so mereli the sheppards their pipes can blow

in scotland and the north of england the peasantry say that if one is desirous of knowing what the lark says he must lie down on his back in the field and listen and he will then hear it say—

up in the lift go we
tehee tehee tehee tehee
theres not a shoemaker on the earth
can make a shoe to me to me
why so why so why so
because my heel is as long as my toe

magpie—it was formerly known as magotpie probably from the french magot a monkey because the bird chatters and plays droll tricks like a monkey it has generally been regarded as a mysterious bird and regarded with superstitious awe and is thus alluded to in macbeth iii 4—

augurs and understood relations have
by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secret’st man of blood
and again in 3 henry vi v 6 it is said—

chattering pies in dismal discords sung
there are numerous rhymes relating to the magpie of which we subjoin as a specimen one prevalent in the north of england—

one is sorrow two mirth
three a wedding four a birth
five heaven six hell
seven the de’ils ain sell

in devonshire in order to avert the illluck from seeing a magpie the peasant spits over his right shoulder three times and in yorkshire various charms are in use one is to raise the hat as a salutation and then to sign the cross on the breast and another consists in making the same sign by crossing the thumbs it is a common notion in scotland that magpies flying near the windows of a house portend a speedy death to one of its inmates the superstitions associated with the magpie are not confined to this country for in sweden 1 it is considered the witchs bird belonging to the evil one and the other powers of night in denmark when a magpie perches on a house it is regarded as a sign that strangers are coming

martin—the martin or martlet which is called in macbeth i 6 the guest of summer as being a migratory bird has been from the earliest times treated with superstitious respect—it being considered unlucky to molest or in any way injure its nest thus in the merchant of venice ii 9 the prince of arragon says—

the martlet
builds in the weather on the outward wall
even in the force and road of casualty

forster says that the circumstance of this birds nest being built so close to the habitations of man indicates that it has long enjoyed freedom from molestation there is a popular rhyme still current in the north of england—

the martin and the swallow
are god almightys bow and arrow
the nightingale—the popular error that the nightingale sings with its breast impaled upon a thorn is noticed by shakespeare who makes lucreece say—

and whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking
in the passionate pilgrim xxi there is an allusion—

everything did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
lean’d her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefull’st ditty
that to hear it was great pity
beaumont and fletcher in the faithful shepherdess v 3 speak of—

the nightingale among the thickleaved spring
that sits alone in sorrow and doth sing
whole nights away in mourning

sir thomas browne asks whether the nightingales sitting with her breast against a thorn be any more than that she placeth some prickles on the outside of her nest or roosteth in thorny prickly places where serpents may least approach her in the zoologist for 1862 the rev a c smith mentions the discovery on two occasions of a strong thorn projecting upwards in the centre of the nightingales nest another notion is that the nightingale never sings by day and thus portia in merchant of venice v 1 says—

i think
the nightingale if she could sing by day
when every goose is cackling would be thought
no better a musician than the wren

such however is not the case for this bird often sings as sweetly in the day as at nighttime there is an old superstition 3 that the nightingale sings all night to keep itself awake lest the glowworm should devour her the classical fable of the unhappy philomela turned into a nightingale when her sister progne was changed to a swallow has doubtless given rise to this bird being spoken of as she thus juliet tells romeo iii 5—

it was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale

sometimes the nightingale is termed philomel as in midsummer nights dream ii 2 song 1—

philomel with melody
sing your sweet lullaby

osprey—this bird also called the seaeagle besides having a destructive power of devouring fish was supposed formerly to have a fascinating influence both which qualities are alluded to in the following passage in coriolanus iv 7—

i think hell be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature

drayton in his polyolbion song xxv mentions the same fascinating power of the osprey—

the osprey oft here seen though seldom here it breeds
which over them the fish no sooner do espy
but betwixt him and them by an antipathy
turning their bellies up as though their death they saw
they at his pleasure lie to stuff his gluttonous maw

ostrich—the extraordinary digestion of this bird is said to be shown by its swallowing iron and other hard substances in 2 henry vi iv 10 the rebel cade says to alexander iden—ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him but ill make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part cuvier speaking of this bird says it is yet so voracious and its senses of taste and smell are so obtuse that it devours animal and mineral substances indiscriminately until its enormous stomach is completely full it swallows without any choice and merely as it were to serve for ballast wood stones grass iron copper gold lime or in fact any other substance equally hard indigestible and deleterious sir thomas browne writing on this subject says the ground of this conceit in its swallowing down fragments of iron which men observing by a forward illation have therefore conceived it digesteth them which is an inference not to be admitted as being a fallacy of the consequent in loudons magazine of natural history no 6 p 32 we are told of an ostrich having been killed by swallowing glass

owl—the dread attached to this unfortunate bird is frequently spoken of by shakespeare who has alluded to several of the superstitions associated with it at the outset many of the epithets ascribed to it show the prejudice with which it was regarded—being in various places stigmatised as the vile owl in troilus and cressida ii 1 and the obscure bird in macbeth ii 3 etc from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of illomen and pliny tells us how on one occasion even rome itself underwent a lustration because one of them strayed into the capitol he represents it also as a funereal bird a monster of the night the very abomination of human kind virgil describes its deathhowl from the top of the temple by night a circumstance introduced as a precursor of didos death ovid too constantly speaks of this birds presence as an evil omen and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets this superstitious awe in which the owl is held may be owing to its peculiar look its occasional and uncertain appearance its loud and dismal cry as well as to its being the bird of night 5 it has generally been associated with calamities and deeds of darkness 6 thus its weird shriek pierces the ear of lady macbeth ii 2 while the murder is being committed—

hark—peace
it was the owl that shriek’d the fatal bellman
which gives the stern’st good night

and when the murderer rushes in exclaiming—

i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise
she answers—

i heard the owl scream

its appearance at a birth has been said to foretell illluck to the infant a superstition to which king henry in 3 henry vi v 6 addressing gloucester refers—

the owl shriek’d at thy birth an evil sign

its cries 1 have been supposed to presage death and to quote the words of the spectator a screechowl at mid night has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers thus in a midsummer nights dream v 1 we are told how—

the screechowl screeching loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance of a shroud

and in 1 henry vi iv 2 it is called the ominous and fearful hour of death again when richard iii iv 4 is exasperated by the bad news he interrupts the third messenger by saying—

out on you owls nothing but songs of death
the owl by day is considered by some equally ominous as in 3 henry vi v 4 1—

the owl by day
if he arise is mock’d and wonder’d at
and in julius cæsar i 3 casca says—

and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noonday upon the marketplace
hooting and shrieking when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
these are their reasons—they are natural
for i believe they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon

considering however the abhorrence with which the owl is generally regarded it is not surprising that the owlets wing should form an ingredient of the cauldron in which the witches in macbeth iv 1 prepared their charm of powerful trouble the owl is too in all probability represented by shakespeare as a witch 1 a companion of the fairies in their moonlight gambols in comedy of errors ii 2 dromio of syracuse says—

this is the fairy land o spite of spites
we talk with goblins owls and elvish sprites
if we obey them not this will ensue
theyll suck our breath and pinch us black and blue

singer in his notes on this passage ii p 28 says—it has been asked how should shakespeare know that screechowls were considered by the romans as witches do these cavillers think that shakespeare never looked into a book take an extract from the cambridge latin dictionary 1594 8vo probably the very book he used strix a scritche owle an unluckie kind of bird as they of olde time said which sucked out the blood of infants lying in their cradles a witch that changeth the favour of children an hagge or fairie so in the london prodigal a comedy 1605—soul i think i am sure crossed or witch’d with an owl in the tempest v 1 shakespeare introduces ariel as saying—

where the bee sucks there suck i
in a cowslips bell i lie
there i couch when owls do cry

ariel who sucks honey for luxury in the cowslips bell retreats thither for quiet when owls are abroad and screeching according to an old legend the owl was originally a bakers daughter to which allusion is made in hamlet iv 5 where ophelia exclaims—they say the owl was a bakers daughter lord we know what we are but know not what we may be douce says the following story was current among the gloucestershire peasantry—our saviour went into a bakers shop where they were baking and asked for some bread to eat the mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him but was reprimanded by her daughter who insisting that the piece of dough was too large reduced it to a very small size the dough however immediately began to swell and presently became a most enormous size whereupon the bakers daughter cried out heugh heugh heugh which owllike noise probably induced our saviour to transform her into that bird for her wickedness another version of the same story as formerly known in herefordshire substitutes a fairy in the place of our saviour similar legends are found on the continent

parrot—the popinjay in 1 henry iv i 3 is another name for the parrot—from the spanish papagayo—a term which occurs in brownes pastorals ii 65—

or like the mixture nature dothe display
upon the quaint wings of the popinjay

its supposed restlessness before rain is referred to in as you like it iv 1—more clamorous than a parrot against rain it was formerly customary to teach the parrot unlucky words with which when anyone was offended it was the standing joke of the wise owner to say take heed sir my parrot prophesies—an allusion to which custom we find in comedy of errors iv 4 where dromio of ephesus says—prophesy like the parrot beware the ropes end to this butler hints where speaking of ralphos skill in augury he says 2—

could tell what subtlest parrots mean
that speak and think contrary clean
what member ’tis of whom they talk
when they cry rope and walk knave walk

the rewards given to parrots to encourage them to speak are mentioned in troilus and cressida v 2 3—the parrot will not do more for an almond hence a proverb for the greatest temptation that could be put before a man

p 135

seems to have been an almond for a parrot to talk like a parrot is a common proverb a sense in which it occurs in othello ii 3

peacock—this bird was as proverbially used for a proud vain fool as the lapwing for a silly one in this sense some would understand it in the much disputed passage in hamlet iii 2—

for thou dost know o damon dear
this realm dismantled was
of jove himself and now reigns here
a very very—peacock

the third and fourth folios reads pajock the other editions have paiock paiocke or pajocke and in the later quartos the word was changed to paicock and pecock whence pope printed peacock

dyce says that in scotland the peacock is called the peajock some have proposed to read paddock and in the last scene hamlet bestows this opprobrious name upon the king it has been also suggested to read puttock a kite  the peacock has also been regarded as the emblem of pride and arrogance as in 1 henry vi iii 3 4—

let frantic talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail
well pull his plumes and take away his train

pelican—there are several allusions by shakespeare to the pelicans piercing her own breast to feed her young thus in hamlet iv 5 laertes says—

to his good friends thus wide ill ope my arms
and like the kind liferendering pelican
repast them with my blood

and in king lear where the young pelicans are represented as piercing their mothers breast to drink her blood an illustration of filial impiety iii 4 the king says—

is it the fashion that discarded fathers
should have thus little mercy on their flesh
judicious punishment ’twas this flesh begot
those pelican daughters

it is a common notion that the fable here alluded to is a classical one but this is an error shakespeare says mr harting was content to accept the story as he found it and to apply it metaphorically as the occasion required mr houghton in an interesting letter to land and water  on this subject remarks that the egyptians believed in a bird feeding its young with its blood and this bird is none other than the vulture he goes on to say that the fable of the pelican doubtless originated in the patristic annotations on the scriptures the ecclesiastical fathers transferred the egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican but magnified the story a hundredfold for the blood of the parent was not only supposed to serve as food for the young but was also able to reanimate the dead offspring augustine commenting on psalm cii 6—i am like a pelican of the wilderness—remarks—these birds male pelicans are said to kill their offspring by blows of their beaks and then to bewail their death for the space of three days at length however it is said that the mother inflicts a severe wound on herself pouring the flowing blood over the dead young ones which instantly brings them to life to the same effect write eustathius isidorus epiphanius and a host of other writers

according to another idea pelicans are hatched dead but the cock pelican then wounds his breast and lets one drop of blood fall upon each and this quickens them


pheasant—this bird is only once alluded to in winters tale iv 4 where the clown jokingly says to the shepherd—advocates the court word for a pheasant say you have none

phœnix—many allusions are given to this fabulous bird which is said to rise again from its own ashes thus in henry viii v 4 cranmer tells how—

when
the bird of wonder dies the maiden phœnix
her ashes new create another heir
as great in admiration as herself

again in 3 henry vi i 4 the duke of york exclaims—

my ashes as the phœnix may bring forth
a bird that will revenge upon you all

once more in henry vi iv 7 sir william lucy speaking of talbot and those slain with him predicts that from their ashes shall be rear’d a phœnix that shall make all france afeard

sir thomas browne tells us that there is but one phœnix in the world which after many hundred years burns herself and from the ashes thereof ariseth up another from the very earliest times there have been countless traditions respecting this wonderful bird thus its longevity has been estimated from three hundred to fifteen hundred years and among the various localities assigned as its home are ethiopia arabia egypt and india in the phœnix and the turtle it is said—

let the bird of loudest lay
on the sole arabian tree
herald sad and trumpet be

pliny says of this bird howbeit i cannot tell what to make of him and first of all whether it be a tale or no that there is never but one of them in the whole world and the same not commonly seen malone 3 quotes from lylys euphues and his england p 312 ed arber for as there is but one phœnix in the world so is there but one tree in arabia wherein she buyldeth and florios new worlde of wordes 1598 rasin a tree in arabia whereof there is but one found and upon it the phœnix sits

pigeon—as carriers these birds have been used from a very early date and the castle of the birds at bagdad takes its name from the pigeonpost which the old monks of the convent established the building has crumbled into ruins long ago by the lapse of time but the bird messengers of bagdad became celebrated as far westward as greece and were a regular commercial institution between the distant parts of asia minor arabia and the east in ancient egypt also the carrier breed was brought to great perfection and between the cities of the nile and the red sea the old traders used to send word of their caravans to each other by letters written on silk and tied under the wings of trained doves in titus andronicus iv 3 titus on seeing a clown enter with two pigeons says—news news from heaven marcus the post is come sirrah what tidings have you any letters from the same play we also learn that it was also customary to give a pair of pigeons as a present the clown says to saturninus iv 4 i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here

in romeo and juliet i 3 the dove is used synonymously for pigeon where the nurse is represented as sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall 3 mr darwin in his variation of animals and plants under domestication i pp 204 205 has shown that from the very earliest times pigeons have been kept in a domesticated state he says—the earliest record of pigeons in a domesticated condition occurs in the 5th egyptian dynasty about 3000 bc but mr birch of the british museum informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty domestic pigeons are mentioned in genesis leviticus and isaiah pliny informs us that the romans gave immense prices for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race in india about the year 1600 pigeons were much valued by akber khan 20000 birds were carried about with the court in most countries too the breeding and taming of pigeons have been a favourite recreation the constancy of the pigeon has been proverbial from time immemorial allusions to which occur in winters tale iv 3 and in as you like it iii 3

quail—the quail was thought to be an amorous bird and hence was metaphorically used to denote people of a loose character in this sense it is generally understood in troilus and cressida v 1 heres agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails mr harting however thinks that the passage just quoted refers to the practice formerly prevalent of keeping quails and making them fight like gamecocks the context of the passage would seem to sanction the former meaning quail fighting is spoken of in antony and cleopatra ii 3 where antony speaking of the superiority of cæsars fortunes to his own says—

if we draw lots he speeds
his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought and his quails ever
beat mine inhoop’d at odds

it appears that cocks as well as quails were sometimes made to fight within a broad hoop—hence the term inhoop’d—to keep them from quitting each other quailfights were well known among the ancients and especially at athens julius pollux relates that a circle was made in which the birds were placed and he whose quail was driven out of this circle lost the stake which was sometimes money and occasionally the quails themselves another practice was to produce one of these birds which being first smitten with the middle finger a feather was then plucked from its head if the quail bore this operation without flinching his master gained the stake but lost it if he ran away some doubt exists as to whether quailfighting prevailed in the time of shakespeare at the present day 1 the sumatrans practise these quail combats and this pastime is common in some parts of italy and also in china mr douce has given a curious print from an elegant chinese miniature painting which represents some ladies engaged at this amusement where the quails are actually inhooped

raven—perhaps no bird is so universally unpopular as the raven its hoarse croak in most countries being regarded as ominous hence as might be expected shakespeare often refers to it in order to make the scene he depicts all the more vivid and graphic in titus andronicus ii 3 tamora describing a barren detested vale says—

the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
o’ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven

and in julius cæsar v 1 cassius tells us how ravens

fly o’er our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey

it seems that the superstitious dread  attaching to this bird has chiefly arisen from its supposed longevity and its frequent mention and agency in holy writ by the romans it was consecrated to apollo and was believed to have a prophetic knowledge—a notion still very prevalent thus its supposed faculty of smelling death still renders its presence or even its voice ominous othello iv i exclaims—

o it comes o’er my memory
as doth the raven o’er the infected house
boding to all

there is no doubt a reference here to the fanciful notion that it was a constant attendant on a house infected with the plague most readers too are familiar with that famous passage in macbeth i 5 where lady macbeth having heard of the kings intention to stay at the castle exclaims—

the raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan
under my battlements come you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
of direst cruelty

we may compare spensers language in the faerie queene bk ii c vii 23

after him owles and night ravens flew
the hateful messengers of heavy things
of death and dolor telling sad tidings

and once more the following passage from draytons barons’ wars book v st 42 illustrates the same idea—

the ominous raven often he doth hear
whose croaking him of following horror tells

in much ado about nothing ii 3 the nightraven is mentioned benedick observes to himself—i had as lief have heard the nightraven come what plague could have come after it this inauspicious bird according to steevens is the owl but this conjecture is evidently wrong being  at variance with sundry passages in our early writers who make a distinction between it and the nightraven

thus johnson in his seven champions of christendom part i speaks of the dismal cry of nightravens     and the fearefull sound of schriek owles cotgrave regarded the nightcrow and the nightraven as synonymous and mr yarrell considered them only different names for the nightheron  in 3 henry vi v 6 king henry says—

the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time

goldsmith in his animated nature calls the bittern the nightraven and says—i remember in the place where i was a boy with what terror the birds note affected the whole village they consider it as the presage of some sad event and generally found or made one to succeed it if any person in the neighbourhood died they supposed it could not be otherwise for the nightraven had foretold it but if nobody happened to die the death of a cow or a sheep gave completion to the prophecy

according to an old belief the raven deserts its own young to which shakespeare alludes in titus andronicus ii 3—

some say that ravens foster forlorn children
the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
it was supposed that when the raven says mr harting saw its young ones newly hatched and covered with down it conceived such an aversion that it forsook them and did not return to the nest until a darker plumage had shown itself to this belief the commentators consider the psalmist refers when he says—he giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry psalm cxlvii 9 we are told too in job who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat job xxxviii 41 shakespeare in as you like it ii 3 probably had the words of the psalmist in his mind—

he that doth the ravens feed
yea providently caters for the sparrow

the raven has from earliest times been symbolical of blackness both in connection with colour and character in romeo and juliet iii 2 juliet exclaims—

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dovefeather’d raven

once more ravens’ feathers were formerly used by witches from an old superstition that the wings of this bird carried with them contagion wherever they went hence in the tempest i 2 caliban says

as wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d
with ravens feather from unwholesome fen
drop on you both

robin redbreast—according to a pretty notion 1 this little bird is said to cover with leaves any dead body it may chance to find unburied a belief which probably in a great measure originated in the wellknown ballad of the children in the wood although it seems to have been known previously thus singer quotes as follows from cornucopia or divers secrets c by thomas johnson 1596—the robin redbreast if he finds a man or woman dead will cover all his face with moss and some think that if the body should remain unburied that he would cover the whole body also in dekkers villaines discovered by lanthorn and candlelight 1616 quoted by douce it is said—they that cheere up a prisoner but with their sight are robin redbreasts that bring strawes in their bills to cover a dead man in extremitie shakespeare in a beautiful passage in cymbeline iv 2 thus touchingly alludes to it making arviragus when addressing the supposed dead body of imogen say—

with fairest flowers
while summer lasts and i live here fidele
ill sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
the flower that likes thy face pale primrose nor
the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
outsweeten’d not thy breath the ruddock would
with charitable bill—o bill sore shaming
those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this
yea and furr’d moss besides when flowers are none
to winterground thy corse
the ruddock being one of the old names for the redbreast

which is nowadays found in some localities john webster also refers to the same idea in the white devil 1857 edit dyce p 45—

call for the robin redbreast and the wren
since o’er shady groves they hover
and with leaves and flowers do cover
the friendless bodies of unburied men

drayton too in the owl has the following lines

cov’ring with moss the deads unclosed eye
the little redbreast teaching charitie

rook—as an ominous bird this is mentioned in macbeth iii 4 formerly the nobles of england prided themselves in having a rookery in the neighbourhood of their castles because rooks were regarded as fowls of good omen on this account no one was permitted to kill them under severe penalties when rooks desert a rookery 2 it is said to foretell the downfall of the family on whose property it is a northumbrian saying informs us that the rooks left the rookery of chipchase before the family of reed left that place there is also a notion that when rooks haunt a town or village mortality is supposed to await its inhabitants and if they feed in the street it shows that a storm is at hand

the expression bullyrook in merry wives of windsor i 3 in shakespeares time says mr harting 4 had the same meaning as jollydog nowadays but subsequently it became a term of reproach meaning a cheating sharper it has been suggested that the term derives its origin from the rook in the game of chess but douce 5 considers it very improbable that this noble game never the amusement of gamblers should have been ransacked on this occasion

snipe—this bird was in shakespeares time proverbial for a foolish man 1 in othello 1 3 iago speaking of roderigo says—

for i mine own gain’d knowledge should profane
if i would time expend with such a snipe
but for my sport and profit

sparrow—a popular name for the common sparrow was and still is philip perhaps from its note phip phip hence the allusion to a person named philip in king john i 1—

gurney good leave good philip
bastard philip—sparrow

staunton says perhaps catullus alludes to this expression in the following lines—

sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc
ad solam dominam usque pipilabat

skelton in an elegy upon a sparrow calls it phyllyp sparowe and gascoigne also writes the praise of philip sparrow

in measure for measure iii 2 lucio speaking of angelo the deputyduke of vienna says—sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous

sparrowhawk—a name formerly given to a young sparrow hawk was eyasmusket 3 a term we find in merry wives of windsor iii 3—

how now myeyasmusket
what news with you

it was thus metaphorically used as a jocular phrase for a small child as the invention too of firearms took place at a time when hawking was in high fashion some of the new weapons were named after those birds probably from the idea of their fetching their prey from on high musket has thus become the established name for one sort of gun some however assert that the musket was invented in the fifteenth century and owes its name to its inventors

starling—this was one of the birds that was in days gone by trained to speak in 1 henry iv i 3 hotspur says—

ill have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but mortimer and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion

pliny tells us how starlings were taught to utter both latin and greek words for the amusement of the young cæsars and there are numerous instances on record of the clever sentences uttered by this amusing bird

swallow—this bird has generally been honoured as the harbinger of spring and athenæus relates that the rhodians had a solemn song to welcome it anacreon has a well known ode shakespeare in the winters tale iv 3 alludes to the time of the swallows appearance in the following passage—

daffodils
that come before the swallow dares and take
the winds of march with beauty

and its departure is mentioned in timon of athens iii 6 the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship

we may compare tennysons notice of the birds approach and migration in the may queen—

and the swallow ’ll come back again with summer o’er the wave

it has been long considered lucky for the swallow to build its nest on the roof of a house but just as unlucky for it to forsake a place which it has once tenanted shakespeare probably had this superstition in his mind when he represents scarus as saying in antony and cleopatra iv 12—

swallows have built
in cleopatras sails their nests the augurers
say they know not—they cannot tell—look grimly
and dare not speak their knowledge


swan—according to a romantic notion dating from antiquity the swan is said to sing sweetly just before its death many pretty allusions to which we find scattered here and there throughout shakespeares plays in merchant of venice iii 2 portia says—

he makes a swanlike end
fading in music

emilia too in othello v 2 just before she dies exclaims—

i will play the swan
and die in music

in king john v 7 prince henry at his fathers deathbed thus pathetically speaks—

’tis strange that death should sing
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
and from the organpipe of frailty sings
his soul and body to their lasting rest

again in lucrece 1611 we have these touching lines—

and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
and once more in phœnix and the turtle—

let the priest in surplice white
that defunctive music can
be the deathdivining swan
lest the requiem lack his right

this superstition says douce was credited by plato chrysippus aristotle euripides philostratus cicero seneca and martial pliny ælian and athenæus among the ancients and sir thomas more among the moderns treat this opinion as a vulgar error luther believed in it this notion probably originated in the swan being identified with orpheus sir thomas browne says we read that after his death orpheus the musician became a swan thus was it the bird of apollo the bird of music by the greeks alluding to this piece of folklore carl engel remarks—although our common swan does not produce sounds which might account for this tradition it is a wellknown fact that the wild swan cygnus ferus also called the whistling swan when on the wing emits a shrill tone which however harsh it may sound if heard near produces a pleasant effect when emanating from a large flock high in the air it is heard in a variety of pitches of sound increasing or diminishing in loudness according to the movement of the birds and to the current of the air colonel hawker 2 says the only note which i ever heard the wild swan make in winter is his wellknown whoop

tasselgentle —the male of the goshawk was so called on account of its tractable disposition and the facility with which it was tamed it occurs in romeo and juliet ii 2—

o for a falconers voice
to lure this tasselgentle back again

spenser in his faerie queene bk iii iv 49 says—

having far off espied a tasselgent
which after her his nimble wings doth straine

this species of hawk was also commonly called a falcongentle on account of her familiar courteous disposition

turkey—this bird so popular with us at christmastide is mentioned in 1 henry iv ii 1 where the first carrier says—gods body the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved this however is an anachronism on the part of shakespeare as the turkey was unknown in this country until the reign of henry viii according to a rhyme written in 1525 commemorating the introduction of this bird we are told how—

turkies carps hoppes piccarell and beere
came into england all in one yeare

the turkey is again mentioned by shakespeare in twelfth night ii 5 where fabian says of malvolio—contemplation makes a rare turkeycock of him how he jets under his advanced plumes

vulture—in several passages shakespeare has introduced most forcibly this bird to deepen the beauty of some of his exquisite passages thus king lear ii 4 when complaining of the unkindness of a daughter bitterly exclaims—

o regan she hath tied
sharptooth’d unkindness like a vulture here

what too can be more graphic than the expression of tamora in titus andronicus v 2—

i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind

equally forcible too are pistols words in the merry wives of windsor i 3—

let vultures gripe thy guts

johnson considers that the vulture of sedition in 2 henry vi iv 3 is in allusion to the tale of prometheus but of this there is a decided uncertainty

wagtail—in king lear ii 2 kent says—

spare my grey beard you wagtail

the word being used in an opprobrious sense to signify an officious person

woodcock—in several passages this bird is used to denote a fool or silly person as in taming of the shrew i 2—

o this woodcock what an ass it is

and again in much ado about nothing v 1 where claudio alluding to the plot against benedick says—

shall i not find a woodcock too

in loves labours lost iv 3 biron says—

o heavens i have my wish
duncans transformed four woodcocks in a dish

the woodcock has generally been proverbial as a foolish bird—perhaps because it is easily caught in springes or nets thus the popular phrase springes to catch woodcocks meant arts to entrap simplicity as in hamlet i 3—

aye springes to catch woodcocks

a similar expression occurs in beaumont and fletchers loyal subject iv 4—

go like a woodcock
and thrust your neck i’ th’ noose

it seems says nares that woodcocks are now grown wiser by time for we do not now hear of their being so easily caught if they were sometimes said to be without brains it was only founded on their character certainly not on any examination of the fact formerly one of the terms for twilight was cockshut time because the net in which cocks ie woodcocks were shut in during the twilight was called a cockshut it appears that a large net was stretched across a glade and so suspended upon poles as to be easily drawn together thus in richard iii v 3 ratcliff says—

thomas the earl of surrey and himself
much about cockshut time from troop to troop
went through the army cheering up the soldiers

in ben jonsons masque of gypsies we read—

mistress this is only spite
for you would not yesternight
kiss him in the cockshut light

sometimes it was erroneously written cockshoot come come away then a fine cockshoot evening in the two noble kinsmen iv i we find the term cocklight

wren—the diminutive character of this bird is noticed in a midsummer nights dream iii 1 song—

the wren with little quill


lady macbeth iv 2 says—

the poor wren
the most diminutive of birds will fight
her young ones in her nest against the owl

considering too that as many as sixteen young ones have been found in this little birds nest we can say with grahame in his poem on the birds of scotland—

but now behold the greatest of this train
of miracles stupendously minute
the numerous progeny claimant for food
supplied by two small bills and feeble wings
of narrow range supplied—ay duly fed—
fed in the dark and yet not one forgot

the epithet poor applied to the wren by lady macbeth was certainly appropriate in days gone by when we recollect how it was cruelly hunted in ireland on st stephens day—a practice which prevailed also in the isle of manembed"
