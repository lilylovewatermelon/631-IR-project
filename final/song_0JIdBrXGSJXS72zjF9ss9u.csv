friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we dont say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side

prechorus
and i know everything about you
i dont wanna live without you

chorus
im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only tryin to
let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me when im with you

verse 2
just a smalltown boy and girl
livin in a crazy world
tryna figure out what is and isnt true
and i dont try to hide my tears
my secrets or my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do

and you know everything about me
you say that you cant live without me

chorus
im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only tryin to
let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me when im with you

bridge
when im with anybody else
its so hard to be myself
and only you can tell

chorus
that im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only tryin to
let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me
who i wanna be
well im only me when im with you
