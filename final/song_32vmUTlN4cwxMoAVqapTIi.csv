when i reach to hold you ill still be alone
when i hear the ringing of the telephone
ill think it is you
it will not be true

chorus
i know why the river runs
to a place somewhere far away
i know why the sky is cryin
when there arent any words to say

verse 2
i could play the message that you left for me
i can hear your voice and i could still believe
that you will soon be home
but you will never come

chorus
i know why the river runs
to a place somewhere far away
i know why the sky is cryin
when there arent any words to say

verse 3
theres a silence that i dont want to hear
theres a hole now where my heart used to be
they say that healing comes in time
but i dont know what that means
see lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likebridge
i lie here for so long
but you will never come

chorus
i know why the river runs
to a place somewhere far away
i know why the sky is cryin
when there arent any words to sayembed"
