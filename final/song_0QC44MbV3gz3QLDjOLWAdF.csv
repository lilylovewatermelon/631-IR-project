ttturn up
ttturn up the bass
ttturn up the bass

verse 1
i still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
i still feel your touch in my dream in my dream
forgive me my weakness but i dont know why
without you its hard to survive

chorus
cause everytime we touch
i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss
i swear i could fly
cant you feel my heart beat fast
i want this to last
need you by my side
cause everytime we touch
i feel the static
and everytime we kiss
i reach for the sky
cant you hear my heart beat so
i cant let you go
want you in my life

verse 2
your arms are my castle your heart is my sky
they wipe away tears that i cry that i cry
the good and the bad times weve been through them all
you make me rise when i fall

chorus
cause everytime we touch
i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss
i swear i could fly
cant you feel my heart beat fast
i want this to last
need you by my side
cause everytime we touch
i feel the static
and everytime we kiss
i reach for the sky
cant you hear my heart beat so
i cant let you go
want you in my life
outro
cause everytime we touch
i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss
i swear i could fly
cant you feel my heart beat fast
i want this to last
need you by my sideembed"
