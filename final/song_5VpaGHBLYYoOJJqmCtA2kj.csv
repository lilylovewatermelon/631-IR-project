verse 1
maybe im just wrong feeling the way i do
thoughts indecent want to propose them to you
i know you have a girl i dont want to tie
when youre free one night just make those hours mine

chorus
i can be the other woman in your life
i can be the other reason youre out at night
i can be all the things you thought she might
i can be on the side that would be alright alright alright

verse 2
love just aint my thing the half of you might be
enough for two or more no hurting me indeed
fine like expensive wine drunk off one glass of you
i think more might be too much so weekends for me are cool

chorus
i can be the other woman in your life
i can be the other reason youre out at night
i can be all the things you thought she might
i can be on the side that would be alright alright alright
you might also likei can be the other woman in your life
i can be the other reason youre out at night
i can be all the things you thought she might
i can be on the side that would be alright alright alright

outro
alright
