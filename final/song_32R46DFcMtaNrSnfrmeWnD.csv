i feel you crawling under my skin
sickened by your face
by the way
to think that youre so fucking kind
you aint

chorus
hard to find how i feel
especially when youre smothering me
hard to find how i feel
oh please someone help me

verse 2
i knew when
an angel whispered into my ear
you gotta get him away
hey little bitch
be glad you finally walked away
or you may have not lived another day

chorus
hard to find how i feel
especially when youre smothering me
hard to find how i feel
oh please someone help me
hard to find how i feel
controlling me every step of the way
hard to find how i feel
you greedy little baby
