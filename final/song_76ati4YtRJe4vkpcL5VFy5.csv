for the way you changed my plans
for being the perfect distraction
for the way you took the idea that i had
of everything that i wanted to have
and made me see there was something missing oh yeah

verse 2
for the ending of my first beginning ooh yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah
and for the rare and unexpected friend ooh yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah
for the way youre something that id never choose
but at the same time something i dont wanna lose
and never wanna be without ever again

chorus
youre the best thing i never knew i needed
so when you were here i had no idea
youre the best thing i never knew i needed
so now its so clear i need you here always

verse 3
my accidental happily ever after
the way you smile and how you comfort me with your laughter
i must admit you were not a part of my book
but now if you open it up and take a look
youre the beginning and the end of every chapter
