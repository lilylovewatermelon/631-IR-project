said its all love shore club mia
party at bungalow 8 when i stay
pool look like a hundred beyoncés

come and talk to me mami in the yves saint
laurent i hope she aint too young woo
only twentyone and older let another nigga mold her
im just tryna show her how a baller and a roller
sleep one place tell the pilot keep the engine
runnin then i wake up in marthas vineyard
st barts this year i think im gon spend christmas
reminiscin bout the time my mom couldnt spend christmas
now im gon send her on her own little wish list
