this is for my mother
from the older brother of your children made of three
now you found your lover
cause it wasnt our father who made you laugh and happy
its been a long five years
ive cried a thousand tears and here we are after the war
but were so much better
now the skies are clearer now theres no more slammin doors

chorus
now i say
dear mother how youve come so far
your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
i hope youre proud mother of what youve done
its a lifelong lesson and im not pretendin when i say
you cleared up my scars
you cleared up my scars

verse 2
this is for my father
from the older brother of your children made of three
yeah youve been so good to us
and showed us how to live and taught us to be free
but when mother told you
that she didnt love you all these bridges hit the sea
so you built another one
and helped us cross it even though you were in need

your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
i hope youre proud father of what youve done
its a lifelong lesson and im not pretendin when i say
you cleared up my scars
you cleared up my scars
you cleared up my scars
cleared up my scars

outro

your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
i hope youre proud mother of what youve done
its a lifelong lesson and im not pretendin when i say
