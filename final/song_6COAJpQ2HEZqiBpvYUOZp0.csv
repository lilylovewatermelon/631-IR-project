all of the drugs she takes at night
keep her awake give me a fright
i dont know what goes through her mind
when she takes drugs
all of the lies she tells herself
wont be believed by anybody else
and i cant buy just what she sells
when she tells lies

chorus
and she takes her pills and she tells her lies
and she breaks my heart and breaks her word
but i still act sur surprised

verse 2
every kiss she gives away might be a good time
but you know the sad thing is the boys all say
shes something of a slut

chorus
and she takes her pills and she tells her lies
and she breaks my heart and breaks her word
but i still act surprisedyou might also like6embed"
