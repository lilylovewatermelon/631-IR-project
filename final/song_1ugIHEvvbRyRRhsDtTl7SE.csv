the dirty lord of the manor
surveys his filthy domain
too many nights raising hell
worked a little all too well
constructed a monument
to denial and excess
sunk so low crawled so far back
theres nowhere left to regress

verse 2
if these walls could talk
they would tell a horror story
neverending winter
violence and infidelity
shadows fall through broken panes
careless words that are filled with hate
just enough to keep it together
never enough to make it work
all the tongues here are forked
we are a hailstorm of broken glass
follow the path of least expectance

prechorus
a huge stinking pile of sick
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
pile it higher and higher
light the match start the fire
level this place until nothings left
and take us with it

verse 3
surroundings are irate
crack of dawn brings naught but pain
resentment steadily grows
laughing in the gallows
full throttle determined to fail
pedal to the metal asleep at the wheel
we are the lucky ones
welcome home

chorus
pile it higher and higher
light the match start the fire
level this place until nothings left
and take us with it

bridge
poisoned nerves and a bloody antidote
violence is not an aberration
its a rule
dying beyond the pale
your beatings will continue
until my morale improves
i dont hate you
im just removing an enemy
remorse is for the dead
outro
im just removing an enemy
remorse is for the dead my enemy
remorse is for the dead1embed"
