lay my head upon your breast
throw your loving arms around me
i am weary let me rest

seems the light is swiftly fading
brighter scenes they do now show
i am standing by the river
angels wait to take me home

kiss me mother kiss your darlin
see the pain upon my brow
while ill soon be with the angels
fate has doomed my future now

through the years youve always loved me
and my life youve tried to save
but now i shall slumber sweetly
in a deep and lonely grave

kiss me mother kiss your darlin
lay my head upon your breast
throw your loving arms around me
i am weary let me rest
i am weary let me restyou might also likeembed"
