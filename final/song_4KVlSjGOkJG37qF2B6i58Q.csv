im in conniptions for the final act you came here for
the one derivative you manage is the one i abhor
i need a minute to elaborate for everyone the everyday
bullshit things that you have done
your impossible ego fuck
is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
you fucking touch me i will rip you apart
ill reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart
yeah yeah yeah
i dont mind being ogled ridiculed made to feel minuscule
if you consider the source its kinda pitiful
the only thing you really know about me is
thats all youll ever know

chorus
i know why you blame me
i know why you blame yourself
i know why you plague me
i know why you plague yourself

verse 2
im turning it around like a knife on the shelf
i wanna understand why but im hurting myself
i havent seen a lotta reasons to stop it i cant just drop it
im just a bastard but at least i admit it at least i admit it

i know why you blame yourself
i know why you plague me
i know why you plague yourself

chorus
