youve been targeted in the night
by violent mercenaries
your identitys been confused
with one that looks like you
youre a simple man living life
you are an electrician
but a bountys on your head
a billion unmarked travelers checks
run

verse 2
find your way deep into the woods
the dogs can smell your path
try to find a way out of this
there seems to be no chance
bounty hunters closer to you
start to remember back
when you studied biology
back in your high school class

chorus
wait now what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things
blood is an energy conductor
i am full of that all i need is an outlet

theyre getting closer
but now you have a plan
lead them to the generator
where theres solid land
the concrete floors will do just fine
and electric outlets
open up your veins and splash the blood
and hit the power lines

bloodrocuted
bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
right now
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
youll be bloodrocuted
right now

verse 4
enemies stand dead in your blood
the stench of cooking skin
every one of them hair on end
their eyes exploded in
you stand with your arms bleeding still
you cannot stop the flow
though you are the victor tonight
your time has come to
bridge
go go go go go go go go
and your time has come to
go go go go go go go go
and your time has come to

chorus
wait now what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things
blood is an energy conductor
i am full of that all i need is an outlet
