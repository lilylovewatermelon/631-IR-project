tattoo our sweat in tears
forever you and i
hold your breath till we cross the sundown
this is the moment
time is racing slow it down

cause you a feeling i cant deny

we are only here for one more night
so scream it like you mean it
one more time
well tear down the building
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young

lets light the kerosene tonight
spark up like fireworks
exploding in the sky
kick down the new year and the future
we cant get closer here
the walls are falling down

cause you a feeling i cant deny
you might also likewe are only here for one more night
so scream it like you mean it
one more time
well tear down the building
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young
well be holding on to this so tight
scream it like you mean it
one more time
well tear down the building
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young

feel my breath im alive
when were side by side now
now this is dedicated to you

come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
we are only here for one more night
so scream it like you mean it
one more time
well tear down the building
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young
well be holding on to this so tight
scream it like you mean it
one more time
well tear down the building
come on come on
sing along whoa
come on come on
stay young
well be holding onembed"
