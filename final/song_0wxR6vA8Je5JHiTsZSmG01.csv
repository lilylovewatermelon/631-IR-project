listen now and let me speak
i will be the dog at your feet
come along when you call
be the little bird in your straw and sing you a song
ill be there to take the fall
though you tread upon me for no reason at all

chorus
just when you think youve left me blind
well ill need to
yeah i will keep you in the corner of my eye
the corner of my eye

verse 2
i will never leave your side
though you call me your number one zero you never mind
ill be your king ill be your pawn
i will build a pedestal and put you upon it baby

chorus
just when you think youve left me blind
i will be creeping right up behind
because baby if i need to
yeah i will keep you in the corner of my eye
yeah

down on the street over your night
out of your sleep out of your sight
if i need to yeah if i need to
out of your mouth in every word
down in your ego one thing is sure
i will keep you i will keep you

chorus
just when you think youve left me blind
i will be creeping right up behind
because maybe if i need to
yeah i will keep you in the corner of my eye
corner of my eye

outro
i will be the bird in your straw but you wont get far
i will keep you in the corner of my eye8embed"
