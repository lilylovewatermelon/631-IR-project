put your hands all over me

verse 1
i cant seem to find the pretty little face i left behind
wandered out on the open road
looking for a better place to call home
gave her a place to stay and she got up and ran away
well now ive had enough
her pretty little face has torn me up

chorus
put your hands all over me
please talk to me talk to me
tell me everything is gonna be alright
put your hands all over me
please walk with me walk with me now
love is a game you say
play me and put me away put your hands all over me

verse 2
now youve lost your mind
the pretty little girl i left behind
and now youre getting rough
but everybody knows youre not that tough
wandered out on the open road
looking for a place to call your own
scared to death of the road ahead
pretty little thing dont get upset
