verse 1
wish i could say it breaks my heart
like you did in the beginning
its not that we grew apart
a nightingale no longer singin
its something i know you cant do
separate sex with emotion
i sleep alone the sun comes up
youre still clinging to that notion

prechorus
everything is slowin down
river of no return
recognise my every sound
theres nothin new to learn

chorus
youll never get my mind right
like two ships passing in the night
in the night in the night
want the same thing when we lay
otherwise mines a different way
a different way from where im going
oh its you again
listen this isnt a reunion
so sorry if i turn my head
yours is a familiar face
but that dont make your place safe
in my bed my bed my bed

i never thought my memory
of what we had could be intruded
but i couldnt let it be
i needed it as much as you did
now its not hard to understand
why we just speak at night
the only time i hold your hand
is to get the angle right

prechorus
everythin is slowing down
river of no return
recognise my every sound
theres nothin new to learn

chorus
youll never get my mind right
like two ships passing in the night
in the night in the night
want the same thing when we lay
otherwise mines a different way
a different way from where im going
oh its you again
listen this isnt a reunion
so sorry if i turn my head
yours is a familiar face
but that dont make your place safe
in my bed my bed my bed10embed"
