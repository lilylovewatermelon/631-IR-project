ive been kicked right down
ive been spat in the face
ive been pulled way down to the lowest place
ive been lied to shamed
i have been disgraced
been excommunicated from every holy place

ive been beat up and robbed
ive been left for dead
for the way i look for the things ive said
and when trouble thinks its found us
the world falls down around us
i promise baby you wont ever
you wont ever feel a thing

cause i will take it on the chin eh for you
so lay your cuts and bruises over my skin
i promise you wont feel a thing no
cause everything the world could throw
ill stand in front ill take the blow
for you
for you

ive been left in the cold
had my dreams held up
had them shot full of holes
ive been laughed at hurt
been the butt of the joke
ive been lit up in flames
i have gone down in smoke

ive been stabbed in the back
while they promised the earth
tryna keep my head high for all im worth
outside im double glazing
i know a war is raging
i promise baby you wont ever
you wont ever feel a thing

cause i will take it on the chin eh for you
so lay your cuts and bruises over my skin
i promise you wont feel a thing no
cause everything the world could throw
ill stand in front ill take the blow
