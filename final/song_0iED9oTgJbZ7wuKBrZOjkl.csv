amys got the letters i wrote
my picture in a frame
shes had a year to let go
shes still wearing my ring
it hasnt left her finger since the night that i proposed
when i promised her forever before i took her home
but i never made it home that night
part of her died too
ive watched her losing her mind
and theres nothing i can do oh
sometimes she goes crazy screaming out my name
saying baby please come save me
i wish she knew id do anything

chorus
to kiss the tears right off her face
tell her everythings okay
feel her heart beat next to mine
and make up for lost time
oh but god i know i cant
but you cant let her live this way
its too late for saving me
but theres still hope for saving amy

verse 2
now 3 years have gone by
shes finally living life
and i still watch her sometimes
just to make sure shes alright
she knows ill always be there
in her heart and in her dreams
cause god i promised her forever and thats one promise i intend to keep

to kiss the tears right off her face
tell her everythings okay
feel her heart beat next to mine
and make up for lost time
oh but god i know i cant
but you cant let her live this way
its too late for saving me
but theres still hope for saving amy

to kiss the tears right off her face
tell her everythings okay
feel her heart beat next to mine
and make up for lost time
oh but god i know i cant
but you cant let her live this way
its too late for saving me
but theres still hope for saving amy
