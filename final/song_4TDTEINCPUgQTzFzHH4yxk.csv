frighten me with desolation
you and i we both agree
better off without the tension
eyes can see eyes can see what we can’t be
take these stones
now we’re falling
as it grows
we are soaring down
better all this intervention
then another perfect night
teary eyed you tried you mention
it’s not alrightx2
we’re not alright
take these stones
now we’re falling
dearest hopes
we are calling
faces frozen in the mourning
as it grows
we are soaring down
see this now
as it dies
take these words
as a sign
take these stones
now we’re falling
dearest hopes
we are calling
faces frozen in the mourning
as it grows
we are soaring downx2you might also likeembed"
