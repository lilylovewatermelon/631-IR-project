sitting on the edge of an armchair
my seatbelt unfastened
shoelaces not tied
letting the wind mess my hair
makeup all smudged
waking up all blurryeyed

prechorus
its too early in the morning
for my words to come out right
just getting used to sunshine
im still squinting in the light

chorus
and it looks like a perfect day
just to get away
all the mundane
has brought out the rebel i was born to be
and it feels like the perfect time
just to break away
this is my life
its a sojourn from the norm
oh
hey yeah yeah
you might also likeverse 2
im a nonconformist
i like doing stupid things like laughing on a train ha
or falling in love again
television magazines
they tell you how to live your life but not how to use your brain

prechorus
its too early in the morning
for my words to come out right
just getting used to sunshine
im still squinting in the light

chorus
and it looks like a perfect day
just to get away
all the mundane
has brought out the rebel i was born to be
and it feels like the perfect time
just to break away
this is my life
its a sojourn from the norm
yeah yeah
ohoh hey yeah

bridge
i wanna do something ive never done
dip my toe beneath the surface of a sea
that ive never seen the bottom of
im not perfect dont have to be
can walk around in just bare feet
im comfortable in my own skin
my confidence it starts within oh
chorus
and it looks like a perfect day
just to get away
all the mundane
has brought out the rebel i was born to be
and it feels like a perfect time
just to break away
this is my life
its a sojourn from the norm
sojourn from the norm
oh yeah ohembed"
