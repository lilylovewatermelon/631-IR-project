god is king we the soldiers
ultrabeam out the solar
when i get to heavens gates
i ain’t gotta peek over
keepin perfect composure
when i scream at the chauffeur
i aint mean i’m just focused
i aint mean im just focused
pour the lean out slower
got us clean out of soda
before the flood people judge
they did the same thing to noah
everybody wanted yandhi
then jesus christ did the laundry
they say the week start on monday
but the strong start on sunday
wont be in bondage to any man
john 833
we the descendants of abraham
ye should be made free
john 836
to whom the son set free is free indeed
he saved a wretch like me

chorus sunday service choir

if you woke then wake up
with judas kiss and make up
even with the bitter cup
forgave my brothers and drank up
did everything but gave up
stab my back i cant front
still we win we prayed up
even when we die we raise up hallelujah
aint no wantin no we need it
the powers that be done been greedy
we need ours by this evening
no white flag or no treaty
we got the product we got the tools
we got the minds we got the youth
we goin wild we on the loose
people is lying we are the truth
everything old shall now become new
the leaves’ll be green bearing the fruit
love god and our neighbor as written in luke
the army of god and we are the truth
