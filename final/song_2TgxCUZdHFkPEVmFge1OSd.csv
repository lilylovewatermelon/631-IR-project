what time you coming out
we started losing light
ill never make it right
if you dont want me round
im so excited for the night
all we needs my bike and your enormous house
you said someday we might
when im closer to your height
til then well knock around and see
if youre all i need

chorus
dont you see me i
i think im falling im falling for you
and dont you need me i
i think im falling im falling for you
and on this night and in this light
i think im falling i think im falling im falling for you
and maybe you change your mind
i think im falling i think im falling

verse 2
im caught on your coat again
you said oh no its fine
i read between the lines and touched your leg again again
ill take it one day at a time
soon you will be mine oh
but i want you now i want you now
when the smoke is in your eyes
you look so alive
do you fancy sitting down with me maybe
cause youre all i need
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likebridge
according to your heart
my place is not deliberate
feeling of your arms
i dont wanna be your friend
i wanna kiss your neck

chorus
dont you see me i
i think im falling im falling for you
and dont you need me i
i think im falling i think im falling im falling for you
and on this night and in this light
i think im falling i think im falling im falling for you
and maybe you change your mind102embed"
