twenty miles from anyone
set my sights on the setting sun
heaven talks but not to me
cause heaven knows that nothing good comes free

prechorus
desolation tragedy
is there nothing good in me is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me is there nothing good in me

chorus
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down

verse 2
petty lies to everyone
in the hopes that i could be someone
heaven talks but not to me
and now i wonder if its meant to be

prechorus  chorus
desolation tragedy
is there nothing good in me is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me is there nothing good in me
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likebridge
ill take your word cause after all
youve never lied oh not at all
but look at me oh what a mess
i get caught up in the things that matter the least
oh let me have release

chorus
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down
ive let me down down down down8embed"
