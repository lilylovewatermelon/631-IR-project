warn your warmth to turn away
here its december every day i like that
press your lips to the sculptures
and surely youll stay love like winter
for of sugar and ice
i am made i am made

chorus
its in the blood its in the blood
i met my love before i was born
he wanted love i taste of blood
he bit my lip and drank my warmth
from years before from years before

verse 2
she exhales vanilla lace
i barely dreamt her yesterday yesterday
read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
por siempre
she said it seems youre somewhere far away to his face

chorus
its in the blood its in the blood
i met my love before i was born
she wanted love i taste of blood
she bit my lip and drank my warmth
from years before from years before

chorus
its in the blood its in the blood
i met my love before i was born
he wanted love i taste of blood
he bit my lip and drank my warmth
from years before from years before
from years before2embed"
