you left me bleeding out when i was down i had to heal myself
got a lot of friends but i feel alone only one i hear is myself
nowhere to run nowhere to hide not a single soul i can tell
i look around i got everything but im still livin in hell
uh talkin to the voices in my head let em tell it id be better dead
pour a cup of my problems out and i smoke a zip of my regrets
mob money over sex til i die boy i need my checks
walkin out on me cut deep ive been scarred since the day you left

chorus
im over waiting on you
i told you im over waiting on you
you can have it your way
yeah you dont have a place in my heart no more
its time to go separate ways
cause im over waiting on you yeah

verse 2
cuts too deep for a bandaid with my new bitch thinkin old things
cause after how you left me i wont ever trust these bitches again
paranoia on my mind i cant help it i wont change
ben frank the only one i know in this whole world that wont fail
runnin and runnin in circles with you you keep on doing the same shit again
i swear that you left me no other choice i cannot look at these bitches the same
i cannot look at all bitches the same when i take your heart know im taking your name
and the way that you ran my heart into the grave i guess i have to charge it to the game

im over waiting on you
i told you im over waiting on you
you can have it your way
yeah you dont have a place in my heart no more
its time to go separate ways
cause im over waiting on you8embed"
