verse 1
the pressures buildin up oh i feel like givin up oh
how in the fuck am i gonna back my first album up
when everything has changed oh itll never be the same oh
nobody knew me then now everybody knows my name
and i feel so ashamed
i never been the kind of nigga that would complain
but its so crazy man
its no different every day its just the same thing
now its been months out on the road
on tour doin so many different shows
head spinnin feelin like its gonna explode
and i just wanna know
if anybody out theres feelin me
im losin my mind and i cant believe
i let this shit get the best of me
and now i gotta let you know

chorus
