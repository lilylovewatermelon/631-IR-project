shes in love with a hustla
she only messing with them suckas
looking so good little tight jeans on and gstring on
and i know that she be feeling me

verse 1 baby beesh
she in love with a hustla someone she could trust uh
someone she could get down with cause she dont mess with suckas
sleep all day and grind all night
living in the fast lane the games nothing polite
so im laced up tight cause i aint into lagging
she love to watch me in the mirror when im doing my stabbing
and she aint into punks giving em bruises and bumps
and she know i blow big so she be twisting my blunts
thats real talk coming from a real hog on the block
she love the playboy lifestyle the knots and the rocks
and even though sometime it might seem strange
she wouldnt trade it in with none of she thangs

chorus russell lee
shes in love with a hustla
she only messing with them suckas
looking so good little tight jeans on and gstring on
and i know that she be feeling me
you might also likeverse 2 baby beesh
well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
but shed rather stick with me instead of rolling the dice
cause she know im official so why take a chance
and end up with a over jealous sucka romance
love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
now thats living like whos the boss
yeah she liking the money but she loving my sauce
even though she approached by them big time ballas
she aint having that cause aint another like papa
and her parents just dont understand
what kind of man she in love with but she dont give a damn

chorus russell lee
shes in love with a hustla
she only messing with them suckas
looking so good little tight jeans on and gstring on
and i know that she be feeling me
