chorus
give em your all they gon say you never gave em nothin never gave em nothin
i go hard in this shit because i came from nothin because i came from nothin
barely had clothes lights was off you know my momma was strugglin
its bringin tears to my eyes i wanna change the subject change the subject
yeah no more pain and sufferin pain and sufferin
they tell me switch it up but i wont change for nothin i cant change

if we aint chopping bout no paper then lets change the subject change the subject

verse
in the streets im movin righteous out here dodgin twelve strategic
makin sure everybody straight sometimes you forget yourself thats easy
i wont cross no one i love but fuck everybody else nah for real
certain scars never heal real street niggas hard to kill cant die
i just hope i see the top show they hand i wash my hand but they aint been doin that a lot straight
i tell everybody im good cause what you gon do if im not huh
traumatized im from the hood wont hesitate to fire no shots baow baow baow go yeah
i remember momma crying bout her light bill like damn
i told momma wipe your tear your son got a skill we in

give em your all they gon say you never gave em nothin never gave em nothin
i go hard in this shit because i came from nothin because i came from nothin
barely had clothes lights was off you know my momma was strugglin
its bringin tears to my eyes i wanna change the subject change the subject
yeah no more pain and sufferin pain and sufferin
they tell me switch it up but i wont change for nothin i cant change
aint got no change on me now i tip the waitress a hunnid
