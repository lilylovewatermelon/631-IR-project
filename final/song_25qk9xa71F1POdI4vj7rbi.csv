damn mikey

chorus
i heard he been dissin on the squad we left his man sleep
duckin’ silver bracelets be precautious when the feds sweep
i want that brand new bentley with the red seats
my pops was there for me so ill be damned i be a deadbeat uh
when you said you loved me girl you scared me
im fakin’ smiles im hurt inside cant let my fans see
they hear me talkin but i dont think they understand me
chеcks and deposits young nigga swimmin in them bands deep

verse 1
head on a swivеl opposition like a block away
teeth grittin off them x pills so high that i couldnt concentrate
i’m timtim gang don’t add a k cause i don’t think thats smart to say
rock out with that tec might make a nigga do the harlem shake
make sure that grass low keep your pole and always watch for snakes
be careful who you trust cause theyll cross you like tim hardaway
impatient in the slums i couldn’t afford to let my mama wait
longdistance relationship with god so it get hard to pray
you cant really plan whats meant to be i think they call it fate
like girl i love you but its only so much i can tolerate
like girl i love you but its only so much that my heart can take
like lets give it a rest girl i just wanna give my heart a break

verse 2
fee say like two hundred racks but the price keep goin up
im the hottest out the raq they dont like me blowin up
back against the wall no one to trust
aint no limit in these streets can ride a bike you old enough
gotta fight no foldin up lack pay the price you know whats up
and when they say who winnin bitch act like you know its us
from the soil you gotta share the same scars to roll with us
say its smoke then roll it up off the act im pourin up
its crackin where im from watch what you throwin up
just reckless gangbangin no big homies over us
fatuated by dollars yeah on that guap i got a crush
been racin to millions the money talks give me a rush
