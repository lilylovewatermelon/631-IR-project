uh
i fuck around with amnesia pour four inside of my liter
one day ima get it all cleaned up right now ima dirty my jeans up

all that shit thats hard to say had a vision lost its way
this planet different that we live in yeah i bet it is
product of the new world you stuck in genesis
and im just tryna rep my city right like bettis did
i got a crazy girl thats filled with all these fetishes

prechorus
plus she can get me high when im feelin low
fill my cup with purple baby drink it slow
and i can take you anywhere you wanna go
dont dont be afraid

chorus
i told her please dont take this back from me this feelin come so naturally
exactly what i wanna do im actin so erratically

its only fair i warned you that love a drug that can kill you
got your open heart id have it never grow apart or last forever
hopin youll remember what i tell you lookin in your eyes
dont be afraid of what can get you high
just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
