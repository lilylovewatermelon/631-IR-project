hahaha nick youre stupid

chorus
we was taught to fight no matter what it aint no givin up
never really know when its your time you gotta live it up
standin on that corner like a rush and we cant get enough
war zone im on my way to school got my blicker tucked
prayed to the lord for better days felt like he skippin us
you gon either die or see the system aint no slippin up
in these streets theyll take your life and they dont give a fuck
aint worried bout the opps i just been tryna run my digits up

verse 1
lost touch with god im so happy that i found you
money only change the ones around you
nonbelievers listened to your dreams and they clowned you
all the same niggas showin love used to doubt you
feel out of place when all that fake love surround you
bitch i run my city they know who to give the crown to
my dawgs on go and it aint shit to bring them hounds through
we dont give a fuck we shed blood on that ground too
and when you fightin for your life aint no round two
in the hood watchin my big homies pushin pounds through
used to daydream of shinin in the hood with these bands
tryna leave these hard times and run through millis with my friends
but my homies died young and that wasnt part of the plan
flyin on these planes wish i could reach and touch your hand
i dont wanna be awake thats why i keep poppin these xans
my good heart became a weakness i did everything i can

we was taught to fight no matter what it aint no givin up
never really know when its your time you gotta live it up
standin on that corner like a rush and we cant get enough
war zone im on my way to school got my blicker tucked

you gon either die or see the system aint no slippin up
in these streets theyll take your life and they dont give a fuck

verse 2
all my shorties know its spark load that 40 up and spray it
tweak with the squad and we start clappin like a standin ovation
doin all this sinnin feelin like im gettin close to satan
this streets a dirty ho give her your heart and she gon break it
just wanted to be rich was out there hustlin with frustration
felt like i was behind so i got tired of being patient
if your mind stuck on the finer things then you supposed to chase it
ridin in that brand new bimmer i feel motivated
fake niggas show support but deep inside i know they hate it
fuck the industry its all cap this shit overrated
promise im gon be the greatest til it aint no more debatin
prodigy a young king thats what my mama cultivated
in that cell public defender tried to offer me probation
now i step out on that stage and see a thousand different faces
thinkin bout my life i probably would have died if i aint make it
rip timtim i remember our last conversation
chorus
we was taught to fight no matter what it aint no givin up
never really know when its your time you gotta live it up
standin on that corner like a rush and we cant get enough
