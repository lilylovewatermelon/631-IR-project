one thousand friends said
have you heard what we expected
we are all working late and
waiting to win a prize we dont deserve
and live to collect it

cant you see im weary
maybe this news can wait

the night of a thousand verses
one thousand strivers strain to hear
a voice thats left us
and the magazines still have to sell us
twelve master geniuses a year
its all so shameless

cant you see im weary
maybe this news can wait
cant you see im blurry
maybe this blues can wait

maybe there was a message in it
i dont know where you hid it
maybe there was a piece that will fit
i dont know how to fit it
tell me what kind of prize can you get
where you dont want to win it
you might also likemaybe there was a message in it
i dont know where you hid it
maybe there was a piece that will fit
i dont know how to fit it
tell me what kind of prize can you get
where you dont want to win it

cant you see im weary
maybe this news can wait
cant you see im blurry
maybe this blues can waitembed"
