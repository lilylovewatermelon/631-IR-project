–plegic boogying down to frank sinatra

always you can see him lurkin in the hallways
carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space
how the hell did he fit em all into such a small place
hide em in the wall well how long will the drywall take
well fuck it then i got nothing but time ill wait
until it dries for the moment i guess youre all safe
after i sand it and buff it i guess that ill paint
my chainsaws out of gas my regular saw aint
now here i come again damn stomach rumbling
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
someones in the back of my damn house rummaging
its a girl she looks pretty thin but i want her skin
vinn— on the hunt again when will it ever end
evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win
severin legs arms damn there goes another limb
pull the lever then trapdoor death is evident

chorus eminem
once again they call me buffalo bill
buffalo bill buffabuffalo bill
skin em up hem em sew em up in those kilts
up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts
man you dont want to go up in those hills
up in those hills uppaup in those hills
you better beware stay clear of buffalo bill

verse 3 eminem
now what you know about buffalo bill
nothin so chill
fuckin ho you better fuckin hold still
make sure none of that lotion in the bucket dont spill
cut em gut em and just get to stuffin those girls
man i think she had enough of those pills
sedate her then i wait i come back later
just aclutching those steel
blades baby when i cut ya dont squeal
i hate the loud noises i fuckin told you
i keep hearing voices like
wouldnt you like to go and get your butcher knife
and push it right through her
while you put your shish kebab skewers into her
barbecue her would you do to her
what you usually do to a girl whose skins newer
in a world of sin you are this is turning into a
torment tournament of sorts christmas ornament you are
ill be sure to ginsu ya til theres no more skin to ya
booyah who ya think youre fucking with
duck because here he comes again

chorus eminem
once again they call me buffalo bill

up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts
man you dont want to go up in those hills
up in those hills uppaup in those hills
