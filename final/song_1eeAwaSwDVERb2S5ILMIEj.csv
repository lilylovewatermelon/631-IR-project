id conjure up the thought of being gone
but id probably even do that wrong
i try to think about which way
would i be able to and would i be afraid
cause oh im bleeding out inside
and oh i dont even mind yeah

chorus
its all your fault
you called me beautiful
you turned me out
and now i cant turn back
i hold my breath
cause you were perfect
but im running out of air
and its not fair

to make you turn around and come back this way
