with this whiskey on my breath again
im ashamed about the shape im in

damn these tears
damn this habit that ive had for years
im tryin hard to make it disappear
i swear i will

so dont lose faith in me
i know i can win this battle wait and see
thanks to you ive got a reason to believe
i can be a stronger man
i know you need me to be a better dad
baby i need you to help me make it through
so im here talking to you my angel

i watch you sleep
my life changes with every breath you breathe
i want you to think the world of me
i wanna make you proud
no its not too late
to make a man out of this mess ive made
to put that bottle down and walk away
