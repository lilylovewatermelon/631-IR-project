i cant tell hows this shit all my fault
its a department i fill but they should
and i send commands just because i can
oh i can just imagine the difference it has

chorus
straight out of your mind
you see im well aware
youre out of your mind straight

verse 2
i said your name it slipped off my tongue
pointed at the camera laughing at you haha
once again you see no one cares
its how you wear it not what it is

chorus
straight out of your mind
you see im well aware
youre out of your mind
straight out

verse 3
i cant tell hows this shit not your fault
bitch youre barbaric king kong get some
switching command just because i can
id like to see you wear it why cant i stare
switching command just because i can
and if i let my guard down who knows what then
once again just because i can
just because i canyou might also like2embed"
