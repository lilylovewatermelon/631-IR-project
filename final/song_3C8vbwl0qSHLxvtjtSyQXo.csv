south africa is where i come from
get me my banjo get me my drum
kidnap career and dont take ransom
dont let me come out of my dungeon
when mi did ah leave then take it down
true say mi come out of england and it done
true say the pattern come from kingston
trinidad trinidad my island

verse 1
i see you in here dancing
your preview is quite romantic
i envy your perfect kind of life
who knew youd be so sexy
i think youre quite fantastic
screw your flaws youre perfect in my eyes

prechorus
and maybe im naive for loving you
youre a cheat and a liar
but tonight youre everything i desire

chorus

i love your wicked heart
beautiful sinner

i didnt know that bad could look so good
you are the type of bad that feels so good
you beautiful sinner
