with conviction
you must stand your ground
dont be deceived
strength is salvation

hook 1
it is so easy to live the life of a follower

verse 2
we must kill the idols
dont fall prey to seduction
with singlemindedness
we must pursue the truth

prechorus
nevermore the victim
let them say that we are not of their world

chorus
with the promise of life
we are strong
we will carry on

hook 2

no more disillusion
let them say what they will what they will what they will
their answer to our higher calling
is conceived by their hatred

prechorus
nevermore the victim
let them say that we are not of their world

chorus
with the promise of life
we are strong
we will carry on

chorus
with the promise of life
we are strong
we will carry on

bridge
be one for your conviction
be one for your devotion
you will be hated for your dedication
you will be hated
you will be hated
chorus
with the promise of life
we are strong
we will carry onembed"
