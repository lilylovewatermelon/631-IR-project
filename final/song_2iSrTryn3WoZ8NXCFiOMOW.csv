old dogs country roads
front porches corn rows
fireflies fillin up a jar
mamas cookin bare feet
tire swingin kids out in the yard
corner bars neon lights
old guitars and bonfires
and haggard songs my daddy used to sing
screen doors slammin shut
tin roof sleepin to the rain

chorus
country knows how i feel
it always has it always will
its in my heart its been there from the beginning
its saved my soul healed my pain
paved every road down my memory lane
when nobody knows how i feel
country always will

verse 2
old barn that leans a little
tractor fields and train whistles
heartache on am radio
when a little hurt a little lonely is layin on me
theres a place i go
where the lights arе low
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
country knows how i feel
it always has it always will
but its in my heart its been there from thе beginning
its saved my soul its healed my pain
its paved every road down my memory lane
when nobody knows how i feel
country always will

instrumental

chorus
country knows how i feel
it always has it always will
its in my heart its been there from the beginning

when nobody knows how i feel
yeah when nobody knows how i feel
country always will
country always willembed"
