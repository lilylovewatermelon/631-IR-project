mafia

verse 1
i put your picture on my mirror
start to blush when somebody says your name
in my stomach theres a pain
see you walk in my direction
i go the other way
i start to stutter when i speak
try to stand but my knees go weak
whats happening to me
in the dark can you tell me what it means

prechorus
i lay my head on my pillow
staring out the window
wish on a star for a sign
is this the reason why

chorus
youre always on my mind
when you come around i get shy
when i see you when i see you
never know when you might walk by
so i gotta be right on time
when i see you when i see you
see fantasia liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeverse 2
i scribble xs and os in my notebook
checking how my hair and my nails look
i feel myself in the zone
i get nervous when you call
so i say im not home
i see your face
when i hear my favorite song
should i send a email at home
youre the number one topic on the phone
i wonder if you know or do you have a clue

prechorus
i lay my head on my pillow
you got me staring out the window
wish on a star for a sign
whats the reason why
yeah

chorus
youre always on my mind
when you come around i get shy
when i see you when i see you
never know when you might walk by
so i gotta be right on time
when i see you when i see you
bridge
something now is taking over me

im not gonna run
im just gonna stand here and see
ooooo yeah

chorus
youre always on my mind
when you come around i get shy
when i see you when i see you
never know when you might walk by
so i gotta be right on time
when i see you when i see you
youre always on my mind
when you come around i get shy
when i see you when i see you
never know when you might walk by
so i gotta be right on time
when i see you when i see you14embed"
