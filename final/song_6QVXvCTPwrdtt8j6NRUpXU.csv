as i walk through the grass
i see little bluebirds
making love while i pass
bees are hummin and theyre singin everywhere
everyones in love

oh oh
i love you baby i love you so
i need you honey ill never ever let you go
cause youre the girl in my heart
youre the one i adore
and ii i love you

as i walk by the schoolyard
as i walk by the gate
i see the weeping willow
where we kissed on every date
and carved in the bark
youll find an arrow and a heart
and underneath it says

oh oh
i love you baby i love you so
i need you honey ill never ever let you go
cause youre the girl in my heart
youre the one i adore
and ii i love you

as i walk to the corner
and i pass the candy store
i hear the very music
that i once heard before
oh how you held me as the music softly played
i was so in love

oh oh
i love you baby i love you so
i need you honey ill never ever let you go
cause youre the girl in my heart
youre the one i adore
and ii i love you
ii i love you
ii i love you
