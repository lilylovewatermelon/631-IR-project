you have been gone for so long
dont know if youre ever coming back
all i know is if you ever come around again

prechorus
baby its so cold
where you are
another chilly winter in new york
cold where you are
another chilly winter in new york

verse 1
i get so hungry
but what i got is not enough
dont got any money
no fancy car and no sexy scars
but i i do have something
that you want
and ill love you till i crumble to the ground

chorus
you have been gone for so long
dont know if youre ever coming back
all i know is if you ever come around again
