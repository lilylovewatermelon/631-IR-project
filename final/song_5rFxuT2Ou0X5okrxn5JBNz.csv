those boys are always up to something
and its bringing me to tears cause
just before you get home it always just magically disappears

chorus
those boys are evil
but before you get home they somehow always clean up the mess
those boys are evil
let me spell out for you mom
evilboys

verse 1
they built a rollercoaster
and a beach in the backyard
drove cattle through the city
and messed up the boulevard
they took me back in time when we went to that museum
they built 50 feet tree house robots
but still you didnt see them

chorus
those boys are evil
those crazy shimanigans caused me all kinds of distress
those boys are evil
sing it with me
evilboys
