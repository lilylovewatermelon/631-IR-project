i found a pile of polaroids in the crates of a record shop
they were sexy sexy looking back from a night that time forgot
oohoh boy he was something debonair in 1979
and she had farrah fawcett hair carafes of blood red wine

prechorus
in the summertime
in the summertime

chorus
oh dont you wonder when the light begins to fade
and the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
forever younger growing older just the same
all the memories that we make will never change
well stay drunk well stay tan let the love remain
and i swear that ill always paint you

refrain
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days

verse 2
i bet they met some diplomats on bianca jaggers new yacht
with their caviar and dead cigars the air was sauna hot
i bet they never even thought about the glitter dancing on the skin
the decades mightve washed it out as the flashes popped like pins
you might also likeprechorus
in the summertime
in the summertime

chorus
oh dont you wonder when the light begins to fade
and the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
forever younger growing older just the same
all the memories that we make will never change
well stay drunk well stay tan let the love remain
and i swear that ill always paint you

refrain
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days

bridge
time can never break your heart but itll take the pain away
right now our futures certain i wont let it fade away

refrain
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days
golden days
