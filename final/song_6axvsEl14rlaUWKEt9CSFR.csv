the knife of insight tore its way in me
a brash collision without sympathy
and maybe when the sun goes down
ill come round ill come out
maybe we could take some time
unwind figure out
when the knife of insight tore its way in me

chorus
hit me up if youre feeling down
give a little oh well figure this out
keep me up keep my mind around
after dark after light
let it go if you want get loud
make a little fuss oh its all allowed
beautiful how it all pours out
after dark after light
after dark after light
after dark after light

verse 2
oh the knife of insight brought me to my knees
broke me down and taught me how to see
and i know and i know and i know
that maybe we should take some time
get this out make this right
maybe when the sun goes down
ill come round tell you all about
when the knife of insight brought me to my knees
