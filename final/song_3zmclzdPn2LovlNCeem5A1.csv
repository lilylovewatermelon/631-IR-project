you know when i grow up
i’m gonna look back at the place i left
rollin the dice on the weekend
conversations and the company kept

verse 2
smokin cigarettes behind the school with my best friends
i never will forget takin that with me till the end
football and tall trees the autumn never ends
summer lovin

chorus
and ohio
treat me well
and ohio
treat me well

verse 3
some things you can’t forget like your first kiss
under the bleachers in the seventh grade i damn near missed
all these memories shootin shivers down my spine
make them into melodies play me yours and i’ll play mine

chorus
and ohio
treat me well
and ohio
treat me well
you might also likeinstrumental interlude

outro
and oh when i grow up
gonna look back at the place i leftembed"
