all i ever wanted was somebody to hear me
and all i ever wanted was somebody to feel me
and everybody wanna tell me that im out of my head
when im on the mic thats fine but that dont scare me
its been a long time but im back now
rap pow welcome to the rap house
rap pow will live til i pass out
blackout blackout everybody keep on wonderin if i still rap now
are you serious
anybody out there hearin this
yo i came in the game as a lyricist
and ima leave like that period
you sniff lines i write lines
youve now entered in my mind
and you better get ready cause you might find
im from a different place and my kind
its a little bit different than yours is
quit snoring hiphop isnt dead
its just been in mournin
from the moment i quit recording
quick record this
listen im warming up and youre misinformed if
you think that im slipping up this aint sick enough
then ill skip the chorus
ive been here aint nobody heard of me
yeah ima turn this beat to a murder scene
i dont live for the world
i live for the king i live for the king focus
wrote this with emotion
its hard to get a break when the doors aint open
its hard to get a shot when the gun aint loaded
and its hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice hold it
what am i insane maybe plain crazy
you put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
you do what you wanna but you cant contain me lazy
is not a character trait of mine dont wait in line
this is the current condition of my state of mind
see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
dont tell me that this isnt real
dont tell me this aint how i feel
this is all i have all i have

verse 2
all i ever wanted was somebody to get this
all i ever wanted was somebody to play this
yeah take my song put it on their playlist
and get goosebumps every time they play it rate us
if thats my calling or not father maybe i should just not bother
go back to that ninetofive but i am not a quitter so quit that
i never been a killer but i guarantee i kill tracks
put them in a coffin lost in rip that
tryin to make an impact in rap is that insane
well i guess so
rap though better give me that pencil
and you aint ever gonna make it its all mental
i am in a place where i cant let go agh
i still work a job and do this and yall know whats stupid
i thought all you had to do was get a record deal and your things start moving
but thats not the case because most of the times—the artists you hear
you keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has prolly been at it for years
yeah in the back of my mind thinking am i wasting my time dreamin
and i aint got no money in my wallet but i guarantee there aint no way that i am gonna leave this
i need this i swear to yall i need this
and this hiphops in my veins if you cut me ima bleed it
and yo what you think i write raps for no reason no
take my pain and i put em in a song—ever since them pills they took my mom
ive been a different person dont try to predict my verses
what youre hearing now is me whether im in front or behind that curtain
i stand behind these words and im a christian but im not perfect
dont tell me to calm down im calm now listen im just working
yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
i dont think they see my vision here i dont think they see my vision here
chorus
dont tell me that this isnt real
dont tell me this aint how i feel
this is all i have all i have
dont tell me that this isnt real
dont tell me this aint how i feel
this is all i have all i have
dont tell me that this isnt real
dont tell me this aint how i feel
this is all i have all i have
all i have
dont tell me that this isnt real this isnt real this isnt real
this is all that i have this is all that i have73embed"
