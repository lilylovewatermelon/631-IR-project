like a rush shot through you
everyone is watching you
told you why i see no need for the sun
ive found a reason to say
a love you light is a love soon gone
if this is it dont bother cause this love is a lie
im a chemical kid youre a mechanical bride

verse
when every vein is red out of the blue
i held a diamond to the sun
to count the moments on account of the way you
smile smile for me
oh were in slow motion when you
smile smile for me
but oh my god ive been looking
but i still hold your breath so you wont leave
pastelred and porn starwhite
ghost on the altar we breathe dont leave

bridge
say that the night sings alone
and if theres a god then im letting him go
all for you you alone
raise my hands
at the thought of you leaving me alone
what if i what if i
what if i i still care
dont torture me or beg me
can you make me believe in tiring
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeoutro
as you fall fast asleep it reminds me
of the slow symphonies behind me
they sing along
all the nightmares youll see tomorrow
all the stars on your ceiling
they glow but not for you
through the trees ill blow14embed"
