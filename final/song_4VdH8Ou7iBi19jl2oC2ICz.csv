verse
ayy let me take you to a place where we never can be found
on the edge of carolina where the sun come out the ground
dont nobody judge nobody only broken hearts allowed
right outside of savannah bout an hour from the town
and while away i was alone hoping you can hold it down
i seen some things when i was gone i want you to come see em now
where you at im gon come get you it aint right when you aint round
i ease my pain with my pen write your name in the clouds
pack yourself a toothbrush still pack yourself your favorite blouse
take yourself a withdrawal slip and take all of your savings out
cause if we dont leave this town we might not make it out
i was born to drown i was born to drown yeah
