im not tryna break the silence
baby im just tryin to fix it
i been tryin to show you the difference
you can slam the door tell me that im like my mother
you dont need to tell me youre sorry
we dont need to talk til youre ready

prechorus
it takes a lot more than a rose
more than a kiss more than a hug

chorus
cause love is not enough
but at least weve got that much
baby lay your head down
you can sleep at my house
woah cause love is not enough
but at least ive got your touch
the middle of a long night
we dont need it all right now no

verse 2
im not fragile as you think
seems like youvе been walkin on eggshells
didnt put them thеre when we first fell in love
when early days have faded
everything gets complicated
you said you want a girl with a future
but everybody comes with a past
you might also likeprechorus
it takes a lot more than a ring
more than a vow more than a promise

chorus
love is not enough
but at least weve got that much
baby lay your head down
you can sleep at my house
woah cause love is not enough
but at least ive got your touch
the middle of a long night
we dont need it all right now no

instrumental bridge

chorus
love is not enough
but its all were dreamin oh
you can lay your head down
you can sleep at my house
woah cause love is not enough
but at least ive got your touch
the middle of a long night
we dont need it all right now no
outro
we can take our sweet time
everything will be just fine6embed"
