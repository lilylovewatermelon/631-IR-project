i told you i was down bad

you let me in when you should have your guard up
what a painful back and forth oh

calling it love but this isnt falling

cause im no good ooh you could do better ooh
you should walk out its now or never
i took the most ooh that you could offer ooh
im gonna drag you right down to the bottom ooh
