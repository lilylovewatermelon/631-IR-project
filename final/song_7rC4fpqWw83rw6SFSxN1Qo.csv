fall of joyful fights
left  me dreaming so long
hiding  in my sleep
twenty of your hands left on
must be something in water

chorus
in  this land with no sea
hoping  time forgot me
‘cause i can’t hold your love
only  your full weight on me
must be something in water

verse 2
i should go away
far from the dashoa
far  from the same stairs
your bathroom drawn in fake vanilla smell
knowing i don’t want better

chorus
in this land with no sea
hoping time forgot me
‘cause i don’t need your love
only your full weightsee men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeembed"
