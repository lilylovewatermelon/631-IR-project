when its my time i know youll tailor a new suit for me
and buy a new tie so ill look this good
boy you were right
you said only the good ones die young
never in my life did i look this good

chorus
everyone welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived it was amazing
ooh ooh ooh
all of my friends are in the room
ooh ooh ooh
party for me id party too

verse 2
youre all on my tab
bartenders pour out the whiskeys on me
and dont be so sad
cause i lived this good
we were closer
now its over
but it doesnt mean its closure
i see you and i love you
