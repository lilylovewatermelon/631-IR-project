the sugary smell of springtime
remembering when you were mine
in 1994
when every thursday
id brave those mountain passes
and youd skip your early classes
and wed learn how our bodies worked

god damn the black night
with all its foul temptations
ive become what i always hated
when i was with you then
we looked like giants
in the back of my grey subcompact
fumbling to make contact
as your parents slept inside

and from this floor
i can see through your window next door
h–µs strumming a tune
on the toy guitar i gave to you
you throw your head back
so overcome with laughter

break
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likedo you remember the jamc
and reading aloud from magazines
i dont know about you
but i swear on my name they could smell it on me
and ive never been that good at secrets no

break

and from this floor
i can see through your window next door
hes strumming a tune
on the toy guitar i gave to you
you throw your head back
so overcome with laughter

so overcome with laughter
so overcome with laughter
so overcome with laughterembed"
