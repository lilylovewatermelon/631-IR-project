i dont know why i never told you
i dont know why i never tried
when we shed these bitter skins again skins again
all the reasons come to life

chorus
but now its over
now its over
now its over
now its over

verse 2
i dont know why you never asked me
and i dont know why you never cared
when we hide these little sins again sins again
all the reasons have to die

chorus
but now its over
now its over
now its over
now its over
now its over
and now its over
now its over
and now its over
