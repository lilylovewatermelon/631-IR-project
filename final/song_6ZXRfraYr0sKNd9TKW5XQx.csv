one two three

verse 1
all alone in my room think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
i keep looping my memories of you in my head
i pretend that you want me
and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

chorus
and i cant stop thinking about you
and i cant stop thinking about you
you never call what do i do
and i cant stop thinking about your love

break
oh yeah

verse 2
cant believe i could think that she would just follow me everywhere i go
i just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow
and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

chorus
and i cant stop thinking about you
and i cant stop thinking about you
you never call what do i do
and i cant stop and i cant stop
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likebridge
what i would give to have you look in my direction
and id give my life to somehow attract your attention
and i touch myself like its somebody else
thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
let me show you

chorus
and i cant stop thinking about you
and i cant stop thinking about you
youll never go what do i do
and i cant stop thinking about you
and i cant stop thinking about you
and i cant stop thinking about you
youll never go what do i do
and i cant stop thinking about you1embed"
