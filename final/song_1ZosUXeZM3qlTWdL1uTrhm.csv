verse 1 andré 3000  big boi
niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
tootin like its cool hes a fool and i cant just
sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
my ends is loose and you cant stop that rain
when it starts to fall

im speaking about these pros cause you know nothing bout that man
the nigga the big is high and fly like valujet
you thinkin about the beatin this my ends is never met nigga
black man white man jew man aint no joke
remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
and talk about when we get older now we up against the ropes
yeah they kickin niggas door down cause it aint no dope on the streets
and a quarter pound of feet weed thats all a nigga like me need
talkin about that southern sess nigga you all up in that mess
but never shall you test and never shall you quit
runnin up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin but dead nigga

so mayday may dré knock em up off they ass boi

verse 3 big boi  andré 3000
well like flipflops and football socks
a nigga be rockin the mic like birthdays
lil jon and sercy so are you worthy
im callin yo ass a flawed pimp
yappin about this crew you run wit
bankhead bouncin to that dumb shit
so what mo can you come wit
yeah they can bite but cannot be us
they can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
you ought to be ashamed trying to fit in my adidas
so run like dmc is me and no dont got no heater
well we zippin around the corner in that golden stankin lincoln
i got my heat up under my seat
just in case these youngsters tryin to take it
pullin the pistol on another black man was never the plot
but sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
they come like black stallions in the night
usually around fo or five is when they figure the time is right
when you good and sleep i couldnt sleep until i seen it
wit my own eyes til they come over the hill—surprise

hook sleepy brown
be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
in the junction in the junction
dont you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
junction junction
to all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
llac and pimps and macks i love the corners that you bend
yall yes yes uhh
