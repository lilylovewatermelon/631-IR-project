tim westwood marley marl and slim shady and mc proof
proof on my side my sidekick
yall can suck my wide ick
said the ick without the d in front of it
none of you rappers want none of it
i’ll put you on punishment like big pun
wanna suck my ickick heres a big one
ill do it with the fluid that i’m spillin
im illin plus im chillin im not a villain
forget the controversy surroundin me
and all these fakeass press people surroundin’ me houndin’ me
but i dont give a damn ’cause i smoked a pound of weed
yall dont want none of me
so get from in front of me like chuck d
all the these bitches wanna walk up and fuck me
whoops did i say that or did i think it
i dont know but my brain starts shrinkin’
my spine starts shrivelin givin em adrenaline
when im killin em and no dnr for benylin
and this is right off the top
take a bottle of pop and bit off the top
tim i said that last time when i was on your show
but it really doesnt matter cause i kick this slowest flow
with a flow thats slow really doesnt matter
said it backwards but all you fakeass rappers are actors
and ima bring it to ya
you got a life and you got a song
but dont know how to sing it do ya
no you dont so ima kill it
ima cook a cracked egg in a skillet and eat it
and smoke it and whatever take my dick and poke it

ill do a head spin a windmill and then chill and then kill westwood
whatever im clever with these beat that i kick over these techniques

like a glock that cock
i rock the microphone and rock the spot
and rappers jock a lot proof come in whether youre wack or not these voices
