i have a death note that has a lot of content

been in this basement wishing to become a songwriter

i am afraid to put my book out there so im freestyling because you cant steal a freestyle if you wanted too

just listening to music every day
all sorts of artists inspire me eminem devilish trio i enjoy a lot of rap and hiphop if you are out there i probably heard of you

if i havent i guess i had better listen soon im trying to find the few that seem to have a view towards god
i rap about heaven and the fight against the devil
im on a different level so when i throw this pebble i want the ripples to shake like an earthquake
this is just a long song that i hope you will understand in the end

when friends and family are dying side by side its hard not to cry
im on top of the world though trying to get the edge off not trying to slit a wrist just want to be with a chick whos down for a nonrenown rockstar a god fearing man im in a basement with a bunch pavement wanting to see god suicidal on the spot

i dont know you but i will reload my gun hunt you down lets have some fun kill you dead in your tracks thats a fact i hunt sinners and killers of satan i need a patent for my words because i got so much mileage its criminal no taxation its a sin that you havent heard what i have to say i just want to up your spirits with my lyrics

i got love i got pain i got inspiration in my dna born from the light and been through the flames but they make me humble i pull through the hell

verse 1
sacred geometry
i am going to go farther than thee
you hardly know it
dont even think of bothering me
ill go on a killing spree
ill go and smoke some trees
believe me man ill bury you deep
watch me creep while you sleep eat your dreams for my beam of power shooting it like a sniper these people are running like they are hyper
rolling with fake diamonds cause im not about that material shit maybe a roof over my head food on my table water in my sink

verse 2

just want to be about the click dont want the clip to hit so i dodge it like its the matrix its a heaux of life i create to protect myself from evil things it just brings me power from the others and empowers me to bring the light out just fight it out with my heart out in the open i just need some love from a one and only woman whos down for me and my words and my flaws the one i thought she was is now lost and left us out there now in heaven so i search for a new soul one who will not flicker and die out
as beautiful as it was i must stay strongdoomshop let me rob from the devil let me rob from under his nose pierced i know seeping out souls to heaven lazy is he just sleeping therewith the shots with a glock and desert eagle
just want to mingle with some girls and have some fun
holy wow are you the one mmm i want that one
be a part of my squad do not hide open wide show me what you hide inside that heart of yours show me im the one you adore show me you have a soul have a heart one you know you ought to flaunt and cherish with another soul for one thing we grow old and wise together as a pair

verse 3
hey there show me illuminati is real bullets to the head just stay in your bed get this party started i can barely dance i can barely sing but i can write for sure murder bodies all laying on the floor blood and gore there is no more souls
im just praying for a few words
im just helping god and jesus christ
im just staying strong nothing much wrong just got those bills though yeah well who doesnt i know the evil is all about that money i know you got to stay stunning bright in my own way like god made me souls of loved ones never fading im just saving souls every day while demons slay away the humans angels save them the sharp blade it cuts deep the flesh is quite thick your body it will be weak in the knees eyes crisscrossed cant see me blade bleeding you out weeding out evil trees of thee every leaf and peddle will swell wither die go byebye new design new garden a new design of a maze that amazes all ablaze from a phase in my life because i want to destroy everything i want to save good souls and burn evil ones titanium katanas cutting fighting my enemies not a ninja not a samurai but ill have you dripping blood and drop your limbs to the ground i have found my sound somehow and dont even know how its happening now
im nothing like no one
im my own person
im my own soul in this intense world
i hear all these people supporting the wrong people all these evil ones growing in power cutting them down from there pedestal as soon as one can that is the plan make a new flight plan for a vacation no celebration just need to get out that is what im talking about being my own person before situations worsen im thirsty for my success
devil trying to put me in a position where i hate god but i know its the devils doing when they have those thoughts suicide let me tell you i never could hate god i can hate the devil satan is to evil and manipulative god you are the father of many children in this world every single one that pray must be many so many voices rising up for the sign of you and your son so many answers are always hidden behind heavens gate you can not wait but you wait for the last days anyway
bloody is the floor of a ritual so dark it cannot hide from the light
flooding the bodies guts and insides trails and piles of the sight
gore lore of many who rest in peace testing my anger im not angry but the yingyang is a balance between good and evil my soul it lingers here you should fear the beast so wield the weapons you keep against him leak out information of him and let everyone be of knowledge of him feed the beast not the flesh of innocent sinners better repent before the blood it drips down spreads out the lakes of the fire crackling of hells fire as the souls they scream in pain like redhot iron to the skin they will wale in painembed"
