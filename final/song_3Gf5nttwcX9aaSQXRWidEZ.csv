verse 1 nelly
in the club on the late night feeling right
looking trying to spot something real nice
looking for a little shorty i noticed so that i can take home
i can take home she can be
18 18 with an attitude
or 19 kinda snotty acting real rude
but as long as you a thicythicythic girl you know that its on
you know that its on i peep something
coming towards me on the dance floor sexy and real slow
saying she was peeping and i dig the last video
so when nelly can we go how could i tell her no
her measurements was 362534 yelling
i like the way you brush your hair
and i like those stylish clothes you wear
i like the way the light hit the ice and glare
and i can see you boo from way over there
see nelly liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus nelly

oh why must i feel this way

verse 2 nelly
face and body frontenac dont know how to act
without no vouchers on her boots shes bringing nothing back
you should feel the impact shop on plastic
when the skys the limit and them haters cant get past that
watch me as i gas that 4 dot 6 range
watch the candy paint change every time i switch lanes
it feel strange now making a living off my brain
instead of caine now i got the title from my
momma put the whip in my own name now damn shit done
changed now running credit checks with no shame now
i feel the fame now come on i cant complain now no more
shit im the mayne now in and out my own town
im getting pages out of new jersey from courtney b
telling me about a party up in nyc
and can i make it damn right i be on the next flight
paying cash first class  sitting next to vanna white cmon
