verse 1
when youre around i dont know what to do
i do not think that i can wait
to go over and to talk to you
i do not know what i should say

and i walk out in silence
thats when i start to realize
what you bring to my life
damn this guy can make me cry

chorus

i cannot get it out of my mind
its so outrageous
you make me feel so high
all the time
