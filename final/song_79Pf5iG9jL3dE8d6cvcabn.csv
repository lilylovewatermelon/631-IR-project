teachers
they try to
reach us
they said it too you know
but now youre grown up
and its time
you were tested
this city made you gold and only when you fucked up
do you miss the friends
the names you crossed off

chorus 1
and i know its hard to be sane
temptation is so friendly
i need this release now
ill find the keys that freed me

verse 2
im awake
in a parking lot
where are all the friends
the names are crossed off

wont you ask me
are you in love with the city
all the stars
whiskey bars
and im on my back im waiting
yeah you could say that im praying
will i remember
where i misplaced you
you might also likechorus 2
and i know its hard to be sane
temptation is so friendly
you come back
to see it
the fever
you feel it
i need this release now
ill find the keys that freed me

verse 3
im awake
in a car
hollywood
boulevard
is this who you are

oh
run now
run now

outro
i need this release now
ill find the keys that freed me1embed"
