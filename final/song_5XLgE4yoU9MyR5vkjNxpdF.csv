i bet that if you could youd go on a date with yourself

chorus

got a new girl and some new tattoos
yeah way too fucking cool too cool
but all your best friends really hate you too
every time i hear your name whys it make me sick

i cant seem to gеt away from you from you
i would say hi but youre way too fucking cool
