im not afraid
of the war youve come to wage against my sins
im not okay
but i can try my best to just pretend

prechorus
so will you wait me out
or will you drown me out
so will you wait me out
or will you drown me out
i have to let you go

chorus
i can wait for you at the bottom
i can stay away if you want me to
i can wait for years if i gotta
heaven knows i aint getting over you

verse 2
i know the pain
that you hide behind the smile on your face
and not a day
goes by where i dont think i feel the same

prechorus
so will you wait me out
or will you drown me out
so will you wait me out
or will you drown me out
