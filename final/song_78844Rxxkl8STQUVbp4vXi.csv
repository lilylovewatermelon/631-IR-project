hey hahaha
im all grownsed up man

alright look hey

verse 1
im so drunk its a bad idea to talk
cause i aint makin any sense im just here to rock
not sleepin all grown up
now the places that we go they know us
tell me mac its so good to see you blow up
cause now i be with cheese like cold cuts
and i aint dealin with a ho got no butt
gotta do more than chillin just show up
im just out my mind
stay dealin with some girls who be out all the time
and the higher that i get on this mountain i climb
to the clouds ima rise over balcony shine
from the light of the sun tonightll be fun
cause the night is still young and the rhyme to the drum
is flowin an island
see the ocean when im chillin got me smilin like

prechorus
ayy tonight will be great
walkin through the door with a smile on my face
like hate me or love me
chase dreams aint worried bout money
ima get it then spend it the way its gon be
and you aint know me if you aint part of the team
if you aint part of the team
you aint know me if you aint part of the team like

too many people always thought i wouldnt ever do shit
im ruinin my life and ill never get rich

my fans in the back in the stand and they clap
give me love all day so im handin it back
they believe so they family
