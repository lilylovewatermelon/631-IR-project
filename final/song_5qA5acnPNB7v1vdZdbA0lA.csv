in the darkest hour when i cannot breathe
fear is on my chest the weight of the world on me
everything is crashing down everything i had known
when i wonder if im all alone

chorus
i remember i remember
you have always been faithful to me
i remember i remember
even when my own eyes could not see
you were there always there

verse 2
i will lift my eyes even in the pain
above all the lies i know you can make a way
i have seen giants fall i have seen mountains move
i have seen waters part because of you

chorus
i remember i remember
you have always been faithful to me
i remember i remember
even when my own eyes could not see
you were there always there

i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about your goodness goodness
i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about your goodness goodness
i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about
i cant stop thinking about your goodness goodness

chorus

even when my own eyes could not see
