feeling outta place plus its getting kinda late
tryna make it home safe and not get raped where you live
tina tummy ache gina got the funny face
monas sniffing dope so her dome is leaning on your rib
i bet you wish you had a benz cause you just helped your friends
flag a taxi now you walking not too far from your crib
craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
said you feeling flabbergasted you just had to have it
made your way to 7th ave flagged a yellow cab
now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
black kid french braids and he keep the potent
hold ya purse dont trust him cause his teeth is golden
dice rolling reefer blowing in the streets he smoking
blowing weed while police patrolling uh
acid strips purple drank you can have a sip
have a fix of this acid drip drip

chorus
hands on her thighs kiss on her lips
eye for an eye drip for a drip
i get ya high please dont forget
i can supply the fix for ya trip
hands on her thighs kiss on her lips
eye for an eye drip for a drip
i get ya high please dont forget
i can supply the fix for ya trip
