theres a place where the sun doth shine
and the birds keep time with the pines up yonder
thats the home of my caroline
shes dancing in the sky

verse 1
oh how sweet when we meet
on the golden streets of the great wide valley
these old chains around my feet
theyre pulling me back down

chorus 2
caroline oh caroline
ill be home just any old time
the grave in the garden wont be satisfied
till your names next to mine

verse 2
and my bones do break and my hands do shake
as i lie in the wake of times cruel slaughter
but if i die before i wake
im gonna see my caroline

chorus 2
caroline oh caroline
ill be home just any old time
the grave in the garden wont be satisfied
till your names next to mine
