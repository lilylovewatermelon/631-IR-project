all he could think about was
im too young for this
got my whole life ahead
hell im just a kid myself
how am i gonna raise one

verse 2
all he could see were his dreams
going up in smoke
so much for ditching this town
and hangin out on the coast
oh well
those plans are long gone and he said

chorus
there goes my life
there goes my future my everything
might as well kiss it all goodbye
there goes my life

verse 3
a couple years of up all night
and a few thousand diapers later
that mistake he thought he made
covers up the refrigerator
oh yeah
he loves that little girl
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 4
mamas waiting to tuck her in
as she fumbles up those stairs
she smiles back at him
dragging that teddy bear
sleep tight
blue eyes and bouncing curls

chorus
he smiles there goes my life
there goes my future my everything
i love you daddy goodnight
there goes my life

bridge
she had that honda loaded down
with abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes
and his american express
he checked the oil and slammed the hood
said youre good to go
she hugged them both and headed off to the west coast

chorus
and he cried there goes my life
there goes my future my everything
i love you baby goodbye
there goes my life
outro
there goes my life
baby goodbye
baby goodbye
there goes my life3embed"
