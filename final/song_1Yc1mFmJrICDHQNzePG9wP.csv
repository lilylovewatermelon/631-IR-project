im damned if i do and damned if i dont
holla fuck the world with my chest full of smoke
i choke on my breakfast the end of my necklace
say dopehouse records screwston texas
the diamonds in my emblem is cut like a princes
you can keep the lexus cause i got two benzes
im in your girlfriends hot intestines
cause i bought her two dresses and some contact lenses
got a message in a bottle hit the throttle in my carro
click and clack my semiauto cause im trying to see tomorrow
bought a condo for my top ho cause she working that taco
its the topselling vato twenty threes on the tahoe
tv screens margarita machines with street marines
got love for the crips and bloods and latin kings
if it means anything this for all my gs
im in jail cause i forgot my fucking abcs
another dwi drunk and fucking high
ill be out before the motherfucking sun can touch the sky
they call me young thurston howell the third
and thats my word
im a swang im a swerve
im a park and scrape the curb

verse 2 south park mexican
imma use my three wishes im very superstitious
no matter where i go i meet a bunch of horny bitches
burn a few bridges feed a few pigeons
fuck em so good they wake up and wash dishes
the food was delicious bacon eggs and biscuits
no french kisses and no hippopotamuses
im picky if you strictly dickly you cant get with me
as i represent houston like the damn whitney
im a get em when i get em i loved em and i fed em
lived in peace i aint gonna let em when i see em im gonna wet em
shut em down like dtown and the homie ackavelie
peace to happareli and my nigga john freddy
my drink is thick as jelly i love my shit muddy
four of us in this bitch and we gonna do them boys ugly
ready for the rumble leave em lying in a puddle
yall dont really want no trouble with the lord of the jungle

verse 3 south park mexican
i walks in the club all grabbing on my dick
is the police officers pattin down my click
they say my bandana breaks the dress code
every fine fucking bitch i see is my exhoe
im hoggin and im doggin creeping and im crawling
believe me this my calling its time to do you all in
everybody jump jump boys trip what what
let my double barrel shotty go barumppapumppum
slanging slam or the rocks up in no man’s land
burnin off in my smokey and the bandit trans am
the rope around my neck is just dangling and jangling
sometime i smoke the rain and get wetter than a penguin
aunt jemima sipper hoes like jack tripper
peace to big dipper what the deal my nigga
hook like johnny” tapia its dopehouse living prosperous
i tip my waitress and she cant stop saying gracias

hook
why when im not high does my life feel like its missing something

i know that i must be high20embed"
