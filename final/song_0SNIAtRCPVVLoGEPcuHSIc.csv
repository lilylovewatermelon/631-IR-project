my life is a movie
and everyones watching
so lets get to the good part
and past all the nonsense

prechorus
sometimes its hard to do the right thing
when the pressures coming down like lightning
its like they want me to be perfect
when they dont even know that im hurting

dont forget that im human dont forget that im real
act like you know me but you never will
but theres one thing that i know for sure

postchorus
