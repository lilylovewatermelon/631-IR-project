verse 1
everybody know i got the kids yelling
dont get mad cause the kids like soulja boy tell em
and they parents they cant see it
they blind
they wonder why they kids talkin bout soulja boy all the time all the time
they cant understand they ways
they wonder why they son and they daughter got they name on they shades on they shades
or why they only wear bathing apes
or why they sit at the computer watching soulja boy all day
if you dont get it its a movement
i aint saying that you stupid you just need improvement improvement
they say the records aint selling no more
its cause everybody on the internet hitting download
now its my turn to hit it my turn to hit it
if you dont get it by the end of this song you wont get it you wont get it
real talk i spit it i spit it
i got the kids on lock and its just the beginning lets go
