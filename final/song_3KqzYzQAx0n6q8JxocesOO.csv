of the far distant spring
or a bed full of hens
or the ghost of a friend
all the while that she wept
shed a gun by her bed
and the letter he wrote
from a dry foundered boat
and the train track will take
all the wounded ones home
and ill be alone
fare thee well sara jones
now we lie on the floor
while the radio war
finds its way through the air
of the dead market square
and the beast never seen
licks its red talons clean
sara curses the cold
no more snow no more snow no more snowsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
