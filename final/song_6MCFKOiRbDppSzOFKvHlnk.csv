shes from a world
of popcorn and candy
pony rides for a dime
little children laughing
im from a world
of disappointments and confusions
but i want her to be mine
i started talking
she kept on walking
she disappeared into the crowd ohoh

chorus
i lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who left my heart in pieces
lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who ran away

verse 2
i was the clown
and she was the dancer
we both knew it wouldnt work
but we took our chances
what i cant recall
is if there was a girl at all
or was it my imagination
i still remember
all of those faces
and now all i have is memories

i lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who left my heart in pieces
lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who ran away

bridge
two different people
in love for an instant
to see that the circus came today
sometimes i can hear the calliope
and i can hear her calling me
