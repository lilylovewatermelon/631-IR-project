she take a shot of hennessy
i take a shot of pimp c and slow up
i do this shit for him and me
im the next lone star to blowup
picture being locked in a box
selling beats cause you need dollars
they say i can make it to the league mama
500 dollars all we need mama
then we gon be on
tired of seeing the lights off
pops heatin up the stove
was close to stealing and killing now just to get em on
couple drinks down of rosé
im tipsy yall faces done look like an emoji
the rav4 turned into a rover
til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
now our money a little longer
lookin back how we finnesin we aint know shit
they gave me three got twentyfive on the low
who knew that lump sum would get me on
my fifteen seconds last a little longer longer
i can shit all day diaper
call that eatallday itis
will i ever fall off i doubt it
you might also likechorus
no no no no
all these diamonds shinin
all this gold on me all these foes on us
how do i dodge these zombies
they want my soul from me
know that im gone but one thing
they will never catch me
falling off falling off
never catch me falling off falling off
never catch me falling off falling off
never catch me falling off falling off
