they make a moanful sound
no one sees and no one hears
my midnight tears fallin down
my friends wonder how i am doing
they look for the proof in my eyes
but theyll never know how my heart is breakin
or how you can make a man cry

those midnight tears find me in the darkness
they make a moanful sound
no one sees and no one hears
my midnight tears fallin down

im stronger with each brand new morning
i wake up swearin i dont miss you
but till i learn to dry the pain of goodbye
theres a nightly routine i go through

those midnight tears find me in the darkness
they make a moanful sound
no one sees and no one hears
my midnight tears fallin downsee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
