where have you been
been searching all along
came facing twilight on and on
without a clue
without a sign
without grasping yet
the real question to be asked
where have i been

chorus
im a shapeshifter
at poes masquerade
hiding both face and mind
all free for you to draw
im a shapeshifter
what else should i be
please dont take off my mask
revealing dark

verse 2
moments of calm
nothing left to be found
a mirror right in front of me
thats where i find
an empty glass
reflecting the sad truth
its telling words not to be told
i need the mask

im a shapeshifter
at poes masquerade
hiding both face and mind
all free for you to draw
im a shapeshifter
chained down to my core
please dont take off my mask
my place to hide

bridge
i cant tell you
how to see me
just a cage of bones
theres nothing inside
will it unleash me
burning down the walls
is there a way
for me to break

chorus
im a shapeshifter
at poes masquerade
hiding both face and mind
all free for you to draw
im a shapeshifter
have no face to show
please dont take off my mask
my disguise2embed"
