well shes not bleeding
on the ballroom floor just for the attention
cause thats just ridiculously on
well she sure is gonna get it
heres the setting fashion magazines line the walls
now the walls line the bullet holes

shotgun wedding shotgun wedding

verse 2
she didnt choose this role
but shell play it and make it sincere so
you cry you cry give me a break
but they believe it from the tears and the teeth
right down to the blood at her feet
boys will be boys hiding in estrogen
and wearing aubergine dreams give me a break
