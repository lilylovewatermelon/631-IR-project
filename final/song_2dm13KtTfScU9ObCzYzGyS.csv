run run dont trail behind keep moving
the beasts wont stop till were dead
all the scrapes on our knees
will tell you where weve been where we have bled

prechorus
oh we play
in autumn days

chorus
wont lay down our heads till the day is won
wont stop running till we reach the sun
chasing all the things that are keeping us young
we wont stop running till we reach the sun

verse 2
oh were building a home
with the mud and the stones and the branches we find
were all just searching for something
bigger than were all able to find

oh we play
in autumn days

we are all creatures of the sunlight
we are all children of the day
we are just chasing what we cant ever get ever have

wont lay down our heads till the day is won
wont stop running till we reach the sun
chasing all the things that are keeping us young
we wont stop running till we reach the sun
