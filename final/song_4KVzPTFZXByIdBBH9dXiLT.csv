oh ive been hurtin lately
im down on all my luck
sometimes theres no one there by your side
i dont deserve this baby
but i know i cant give up
tough times ill just take them in stride

chorus
mmm im almost there only one more step
whoa left right left right left
mmm im movin on i got no regrets
whoa left right left right left

verse 2
i said times are changin
tell me how can i keep up
every time i turn around theres a wall
but im climbing daily until i see the top
and i get up right after every fall
when youre brokenhearted and your lost without me
yeah you gotta walk alone yeah its true
flash every smile cause ive been lost for miles
cause yeah i know youve felt this way before too

chorus
mmm were almost there baby one more step
whoa left right left right left
mmm were movin on we got no regrets
whoa left right left right left
whoa left right left right left
whoa left right left right left
whoa were almost there only one more step
whoa left right left right left

mmm i know it looks like its too far
but its nothing compared to how far weve come
walking down this boulevard
when the darkest times come right before the sun

chorus
were almost there baby one more step
whoa left right left right left
were movin forward and theres no regrets
whoa left right left right
whoa left right left right left
whoa left right left right left
whoa were almost there only one more step
whoa left right left right left
whoa left right left right left
whoa left right left right left
whoa were almost there only one more step
whoa left right left right left2embed"
