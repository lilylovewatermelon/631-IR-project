he was seconds from glory or moments from death
they knew with this bull it could go either way
he said let her go boys an pray

he hung on for eight but he couldnt get loose
thats when a clown they call crazy came to his rescue
when the dust finally settled they both walked away
yeah they became best of friends that day

the cowboy an clown close as two brothers
chips up or down they could count on each other
buckles an beers winnin an losin
laughter an tears broken hearts an bruises
they lived for the next final round
the cowboy an clown

from denver to dallas to the calgary stampede
they took all those towns an a few in between
but it ernded one night in a west texas town
the bulls either got faster or ol crazy slowed down

five hundred pickups lights on drivin slow
a tent on the hill at the end of the road
when the last bible closed one cowboy stayed
he said let her go boys and pray
