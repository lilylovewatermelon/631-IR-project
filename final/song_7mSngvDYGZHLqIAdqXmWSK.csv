thank you you know exactly who you are
you played the role of superglue when i was fallin apart
through all the papercuts and all the broken hearts
you played the role of superglue when i was fallin apart
thank you you know exactly who you are
you played the role of superglue when i was fallin apart
through all the nightmares and anxiety scares
you played the role of superglue when i was fallin apart

outro computerized voice
hi its so quiet
where did the music go
i was boppin my head and tappin my feet
and having a grand old time more please
i want more give me more music
give me it now i want it
hey do you remember that time when we were listening
to some fine music by the gym class heroes
and it was two minutes ago
do you remember that that was cool
hey do you remember that time when we went fishing
with fat tommy and we wore clown shoes
and we caught some lake trout
but they had big teeth and antlers and fat tommy said
those are not lake trout
those are space cowboys from west lancanshire
and i said i dont believe you
and fat tommy said i dont believe me
well so be it says i do you remember that
and now it never happened
hey anyways im outta here
