verse 1
i didnt mean to end his life i know it wasnt right
i cant even sleep at night cant get it off my mind
i need to get out of sight fore i end up behind bars
what started out as a simple altercation
turned into a real sticky situation
me just thinking on the time that im facing
makes me wanna cry

prechorus
cause i didnt mean to hurt him
coulda been somebodys son
and i took his heart when
i pulled out that gun
rumpumpumpum rumpumpumpum rumpumpumpum
man down
rumpumpumpum rumpumpumpum rumpumpumpum
man down

chorus
oh mama mama mama
i just shot a man down
in central station
in front of a big ol crowd
oh why
oh why
oh mama mama mama
i just shot a man down
in central station
