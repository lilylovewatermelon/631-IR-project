sticks and stones shattered bones
but in the end they always heal
take a sip make a joke
to numb the pain but this is real
every time i look in the mirror
all your words i keep on hearing
are tearing me apart
all the names secret games
what you did behind my back
memories echoing
making sense not playing back
every time i look in the mirror
all your words i keep on hearing

chorus
i think you mightve said too much
sorry isnt good enough
i thought that you would call this love love
no you cant take it back
i think you mightve said too much
man you really messed me up
i thought that you would call this love love
no you cant take it back
but i think you mightve said too much

i can glue back broken glasses
but i cant fix what you were smashing
dont apologize again
i wont make a frozen bed
no no no
sticks and stones shattered bones
but in the end they always heal
all the lies you crossed the line
you showed me how you really deal
every time i look in the mirror
i can see my future clearer

chorus
i think you mightve said too much
sorry isnt good enough
i thought that you would call this love love
no you cant take it back
i think you mightve said too much
man you really messed me up
i thought that you would call this love love
no you cant take it back
but i think you mightve said too much

chorus
i think you mightve said too much
sorry isnt good enough
i thought that you would call this love love
