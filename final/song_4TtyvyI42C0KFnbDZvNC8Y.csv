this is a song i did with jack antonoff and jack is one of my friends and so we were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes i made this amazing track the other day its so cool i love these guitar sounds
and he played it for me and immediately i could hear this finished song in my head and i just said please please let me have that let me play with it like send it to me
and so he sent it to me and i was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called i wish you would because jack wrote back and said i love that
so this is another way of writing its writing to track

okay so this is an idea called i wish you would its kind of about this guy whos like hes driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his exgirlfriends house and its like he thinks she hates him but shes still in love with him very dramatic this track is sick hope you like this
its 2 am in your car
windows down past my street the memories start
its in the past
you drive straight ahead
you thinking that i hate you now
cause you still dont know what i never said

i wish you would come back
wish i never hung up the phone like i did
i wish you knew that
id never forget you as long as i live and i
wish you were right here right now its all good
i wish you would
