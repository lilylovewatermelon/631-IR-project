no better colour
looked everywhere
driving home every night
the shadows stay by your side

verse 2
you built a city
all in your head
triangle of ever light
it turns you on every night

instrumental

verse 3
need a companion
a hidden prayer
you know youre not losing your mind
what’s left you make something of it
the sky and whats left above it
the way you want nothing of it
baby im yours

verse 4
no better color
look everywhere
you built a city
all in your head
you know youre not losing your mind
what’s left you make something of it
the sky and whats left above it
the way you want nothing of it
