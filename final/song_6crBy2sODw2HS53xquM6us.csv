this is the greatest and best song in the world…
…tribute

verse 1
long time ago me and my brother kyle here
we was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
all of a sudden there shined a shiny demon
in the middle of the road
and he said “play the best song in the world
or ill eat your soul” soul

verse 2
well me and kyle we looked at each other
and we each said “okay”
and we played the first thing that came to our heads just so happened to be
the best song in the world it was the best song in the world

chorus
look into my eyes and its easy to see
one and one make two two and one make three
it was destiny
once every hundredthousand years or so
when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
and the grass doth growho
see tenacious d liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likeverse 3
needless to say the beast was stunned
a whipcrack went his whippy tail and the beast was done
he asked us snort “be you angels”
and we said “nay we are but men” rock
ahhh ahhh ahhhahah
ohhh whoah
ahwhoahoh

chorus
this is not the greatest song in the world no
