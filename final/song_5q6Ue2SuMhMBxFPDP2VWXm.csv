weathered and faded
who feels alone in the world
you do
too complicated
its not the same anymore
youre through

prechorus
youre signing off again
but youre my only friend
i dont know what to say
i feel the ending close

chorus
pick up the pieces
finding a place in the world to be
too many reasons
to keep an ear at the door for me

outro
will you come back again
i only need a friend
when its all said and done
will you need me too girl
girl
