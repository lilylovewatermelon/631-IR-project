the prince is back
may day trey day
mister thanksgiving
street anthems
dj drama
talk to em trey

verse 1
so here we go with this again running at them lips again
yelling in my ear and shit all i hear is whispering
no matter what it is she always start to bitching and
tripping and i almost start to call that girl a bitch again
so i blaze out the house in a rage out the house
shawty got a sharp tongue she spit blades out her mouth
i throw my stunnas on i chop blades out the house
she get to growling and im out its like a cage in the house
phone on silent and im wilding cause im bout
five shots of henny in man im making plenty friends
black white dominican back right i break it in
this is the act right i need to take it in lets go
i been drinking tryna take my mind up off all the yelling and all the screaming
but all that its doing is taking me far from your loving
got this girl in my ear telling me what i dont need to hear
sipping what im sipping and she bout to catch me slipping

verse 2
now shes grinding and the way she popping that thang
dropping that thang reminds me it aint a girl in this world like mines
wish she come find me its gettin heated up if she keep it up we gon be leaving here
sipping what im sipping and she bout to catch me slipping

im tryna keep myself from going down
with all the love i give you all you ever do is frown
sipping what im sipping and she bout to catch me slipping
