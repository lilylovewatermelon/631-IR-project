hey ten thousand dollar hands million dollar plan
my fams still the only people that really know me for who i am
damn got me askin when i got this fly
the type to change because of fame im just not that guy
still sippin on my 40 when the cops drove by
when i go gotta tell my girl to stop dont cry
see iii been buyin these diamonds
all designer clothes and a benz just to drive in
autograph signin mustve got to my head
fuck that ive been the same lil mufucka
always down to share my shit melody with snare kick
so i dont give a fuck about some lames i rode the ferry with
my larynx is imperative to live musics what i need boy
destroy all of these fake mes they decoys
everywhere i go these companies give me free toys
these random strangers just treatin me like we boys

chorus
ayo pennsylvania nights nights 930 flights flights
thinking to myself where does all this go go
no time to care care got more i can share share
by now this life is all i know
so this is all i know know this is all i know know
taught myself to walk then got up and took flight took flight
hey bullshits always gonna be bullshit bullshit
so make a toast to a good life good life

hey hey ten thousand dollar hands billion dollar plan
listenin to jams while im sittin in my van
this is who i am wrote these lyrics on my dna code
happy as hell mdma yo
fuck a job there aint no one that i call my boss
we just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov
and it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
thinkin bout my people who was murdered in the holocaust
got me thankful just for life by itself
and theres way more people here i should be tryna help
am i wrong for spendin money how i do prolly yes
its just funny old people see the logo on my chest
you got ya thumb held high we can be friends
other people pretend we hang out on the weekends
these fuckers lil bit creepy so we just leave them
say get some rest when i die ima sleep in
