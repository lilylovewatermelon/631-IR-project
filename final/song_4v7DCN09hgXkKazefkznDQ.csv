interlude akon
yo this one here
goes out to all my players out there man you know
that got that one good girl dawg thats always been there man
like took all the bullshit
but then one day she cant take it no more and decides to leave

verse 1 akon
yeah i woke up in the middle of the night
and i noticed my girl wasnt by my side
couldve sworn i was dreamin for her
i was feenin so i had to take a little ride
backtrackin on these few years
tryin to figure out what i do to make it go bad
cause ever since my girl left me
my whole life came crashin and im so

cant believe i had a girl like you
and i just let you walk right out of my life
after all i put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side
what really hurt me is i broke your heart

i really wanna make things right
cause without you in my life girl im so

verse 3 akon
been all about the world aint never met a girl
that could take the things that you been through
never thought the day would come
where you would get up and run
and i would be out chasin you
cause aint nowhere in the globe id rather be
aint no one in the globe id rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be
so happy but now so lonely
