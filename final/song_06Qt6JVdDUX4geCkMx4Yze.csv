theres so many things ive been wanting to say

i made you a song
i promised your mom that id write while im gone
you say daddy come home
well youll just have to wait
i hope when i get there that it wont be too late

skylar i just missed your first step today
i have no excuses and nothing to say
i live on a bus with a rock n roll band
i hope when your older that youll understand

im coming home soon
this tours almost through
i promise ill try to spend more time with you
you say daddy come home
youll just have to wait
i hope when i get there that it wont be too late

not a single day passes that i dont think of you
im running on empty and a mountain so high
i can pull out your pictures and look in your eyes

i long for the day when your old man comes home
it kills me to hear you say daddy dont go
you say daddy come home
youll just have to wait
i hope when i get there that it wont be too late

daddys at work now hes trying to pay bills
egos and assholes are part of my deal
i make some money and i have some fun
the tax man he cometh and im back to square one

dont worry bout your daddy
you girls be good
give a kiss to your mother
i sure wish i could
this life has its moments
im not always sad
take care and i love you
your rock n roll dadembed"
