youre so far from silhouette
you tell on yourself between every word
and leave all this room for me

outro
you speak in dictionaries while fearing less than all will understand
virgo moon im so used to your dance
tongue too swole to comprehend
i see you duck and dodge at every bend
afraid to play your card be forced to show your hand
i hope you take from this that itll make you no less of a man
to break your walls and simply grab my hand
love shouldnt be contraband
it shouldnt trample on your confidence
shouldnt be seen as less than compliments4embed"
