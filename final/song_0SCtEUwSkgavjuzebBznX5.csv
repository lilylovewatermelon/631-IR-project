eighteen years have come and gone
for mama they flew by
but for me they drug on and on
we were loading up that chevy
both trying not to cry
mama kept on talking
putting off goodbye
and she took my hand and said
baby dont forget

chorus 1
before you hit the highway
you better stop for gas
theres a 50 in the ashtray
in case you run short on cash
heres a map and heres a bible
if you ever lose your way

interlude
just one more thing before you leave
dont forget to remember me

verse 2
this downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
and those bills there on the counter
keep telling me im on my own
and just like every sunday i called mama up last night
and even when its not i tell her everythings alright
before we hung up i said
hey mama dont forget
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likechorus 2
to tell my baby sister ill see her in the fall
and tell meemaw that i miss her
yeah i should give her a call
and make sure you tell daddy
that im still his little girl

interlude
yeah i still feel like im where im supposed to be
but dont forget to remember me

verse 3
tonight i find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
i havent done this in a while
so i dont know what to say
but lord i feel so small sometimes
in this big old place

outro
yeah i know theres more important things
but dont forget to remember me
dont forget to remember me1embed"
