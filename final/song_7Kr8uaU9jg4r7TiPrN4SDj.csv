how can one fall all the time
and climb again
how does one heart feel so lost
to find again
how can one road
lead the way today
before givin it all

chorus
i wish i could
fly to the top of the mountains
so that i could
see just how far this will go go go
feels like im stuck in the battle
equipped with no armor
but still standing strong
cause to be a survivor yall gotta know
how yall better know
how to keep holdin on

verse 2
how does one give all they got trust
receive a half
how does one live day to day day
forget the past
im all here on my own if so
ima do this all alone
i can never live and be afraid yeah

bridge
against the wind

a prophet he said dont stop til you got it ooooh
