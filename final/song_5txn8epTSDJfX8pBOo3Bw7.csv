we heard the word now we know just what your thinking
you want us dead now you wanna see us sinking
we have no choice now this is the game youve chosen
my clique is killer just like the dank im smoking
its time for action time for retaliation
you aint a real g been watching too much jason

verse 1
ball my fist around clips
may you sleep in peace with the fish
yous a ho and in the pen you be a bitch
using red mms for a lipstick

hook
they want to come to bloody war
are you sure you want to take me to war
they want to come to bloody war
are you sure you want to take me to war

verse 2
i got my gs i got my team
put me down for murder in 1st degree
my clip is full but thatll change
heard you got your vest on but i want brains
these lonely days and lonely nights
cause i need my revenge right by my side
my gun is hot my heart is cold
every one around me has killed before
you might also likehook
they want to come to bloody war
are you sure you want to take me to war

verse 3
i snatched your bitch then snatched your life
and keep your fingers from bragging rights
next week youll be washing my troca
cus your ass aint shit but a panocha
you got a choice die or be miserable
no vowels homie the invisible
i warned you all to stay off my genitiles
now i gotta turn you fruits into vegetables
having nightmare homie you aint dead yet
waking up with your muthafucken bed wet
i have fun with fucken punks like you
tell his momma not to worry hell be dead by 2
his head impounded they never found it
he in the dirt you could say he got grounded
imma shout it live it how i tell it
and if u see him tell him i said

hook
they want to come to bloody war
are you sure you want to take me to war
they want to come to bloody war
are you sure you want to take me to war5embed"
