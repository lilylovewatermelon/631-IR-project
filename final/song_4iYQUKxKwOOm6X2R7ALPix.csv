theres a little moonlight dancin on the sand
theres a warm breeze blowin by the ocean as youre taking my hand
you need to know where im standing now
that im right on the edge of giving in to ya
baby its a long way down

chorus
if i fall can you let me down easy
if i leave my heart with you tonight
will you promise me that youre gonna treat it right
im barely hangin on
if i fall can you let me down easy

verse 2
the scent of your perfume floatin in the air
youre looking like an angel lyin on a blanket with a halo of hair
and those lips look to good to be true
once i taste that kiss i know whatll happen
ill be at the mercy of you

chorus
if i fall can you let me down easy
if i leave my heart with you tonight
will you promise me that youre gonna treat it right
im barely hangin on
so if i fall can you let me down easy
