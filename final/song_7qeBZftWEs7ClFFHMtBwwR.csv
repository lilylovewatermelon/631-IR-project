ayo bans what you cookin

verse 1
no new shoes til mama get her taxes
police harass me cause its thug life survival tactics
from a shoebox to my mattress from my mattress to the bank
been doin this shit since i was seventeen you think that i cant think
my gangster what the fuck you thinkin
bout these cold killers and dope sniffers that run with me
seen that i dont fuck with em now they come for me
they know he keep it tucked with him
now which one yall wanna romp with me
back against the wall real through it all now they wan see me bleed

chorus
the sun dont shine no more the rain dont fall
ill be back on my feet soon as the time come round
i stack that money up tall just in case bad days call
i heard they comin to see me tell em it wont be easy woah
let down that window then they spray round nigga walk walk
bitch lay your pussy ass on the floor big 4ktrey and i want all the smoke
two hundred for lil bro a pole and he told me he aint need it
we fell off cause i was loaded she just flashed and i was leanin
