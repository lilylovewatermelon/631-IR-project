i got close
to your skin
while you were sleeping
i taste the salt on your hands
i reached out
to touch you
the morning light disarms you
wont you let me in

chorus
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
its a long way for heartbreak
let your heart wait and bleed
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender to me

verse 2
ive become your shadow
i love but dont know how to
im always lost for words
you look like a thousand suns
i wanna be the only one
left when your day is done

ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
its a long way for heartbreak
let your heart wait and bleed
ohhhhhhh

bridge
i cant have you close
so i become a ghost
and i watch you
i watch you
maybe if you stay
we could die this way
but i wont stop you
i wont stop you

chorus
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
its a long way for heartbreak
let your heart wait and bleed
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender to me
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender
its a long way for heartbreak
let your heart wait and bleed
ohhhhhhh
how long till your surrender to meembed"
