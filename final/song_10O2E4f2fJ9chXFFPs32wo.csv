penniless and tired with your hair grown long
i was looking at you there and your face looked wrong
memory is a fickle sirens song
i didnt understand
in the gentle light as the morning nears
you dont say a single word of the last two years
where you were or when you reached the frontier
i didnt understand

verse 2
see your rugged hands and a silver knife
twenty dollars in your hand that you hold so tight
all the evidence of your vagrant life
my brother you were gone
and you will try to do what you did before
pull the wool over your eyes for a week or more
let your family take you back to your
original mind

interlude
theres nothing i can do
theres nothing i can do
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing i can say i can say
