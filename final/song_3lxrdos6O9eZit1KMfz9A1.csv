got up on the wrong side of life today yeah
crashed the car and im gonna be really late
my phone doesnt work cause its out of range
looks like its just one of those kind of days
you cant kick me down im already on the ground
no you cant cause you couldnt catch me anyhow
blue skies but the sun isnt coming out no
today is like im under a heavy cloud

and i feel so alive
i cant help myself

i just wanna scream and lose control
throw my hands up and let it go
forget about everything and run away yeah
i just wanna fall and lose myself
laughing so hard it hurts like hell
forget about everything and run away yeah
