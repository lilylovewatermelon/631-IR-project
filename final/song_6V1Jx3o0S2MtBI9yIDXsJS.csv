dmac on the fuckin track
tahj money

chorus
i stood ten toes i couldnt fold or panic
them streetsll turn a good kid into a cold lil savage
no point in church cause the preacher cant keep them poles from clappin
it seem like evil and my soul attractin
hope for forgiveness for my sins while i load the ratchet
playin with bundles of that raw that dope get sold to addicts
forever scarred cause the way i lost my bros was tragic
member how we came up like damn this wasnt supposed to happen

verse 1
a nigga plot on me and ima have his homies cryin
go handle that they wipe his nose way before we try
cant really feed into a nigga when i know he lyin
love my lil killer keep him with me cause i know he ridin
hood on my back was bustin twofours like kobe bryant
sometimes i think like whats the likelihood of kobe dyin
in that i8 i drop the top to let my rollie shine
make all these bitches stop and stare like girl he know he fine
lookin at this jewelry thinkin back when we was schemin for meals
i took my glock on tour with me way ot with the steel
might pour my heart out on these beats til all my secrets revealed
you know the fake gon knock a nigga when he keepin it real
too much madness in this world shit got me fiendin for pills
if them bullets aint take out lil bit hed be in the field
i got soldiers marchin lookin for a reason to kill
he passionate about the murder slang that heat with some skill

i stood ten toes i couldnt fold or panic
them streetsll turn a good kid into a cold lil savage
no point in church cause the preacher cant keep them poles from clappin
it seem like evil and my soul attractin
hope for forgiveness for my sins while i load the ratchet
playin with bundles of that raw that dope get sold to addicts
forever scarred cause the way i lost my bros was tragic
member how we came up like damn this wasnt supposed to happen

verse 2
you know the comeup was real when your mans hate
i just want a bag put in that work and grow my fanbase
i just spill my life up on that beat and switch my landscape
i been tryna load up on them hundreds til them bands break
they say money talk them vvss help it translate
and robbers get some hot shit out the nine when them cans shake
these days niggas logged in to who they wanna be
feet up in the county nigga better give that phone to me
i aint got it all so could you please watch your tone with me
got my granny trippin tryna figure out whats wrong with me
im from where you gotta make it happen when you wanna eat
they know ima spazz every time i breathe on the beat

chorus
i stood ten toes i couldnt fold or panic
them streetsll turn a good kid into a cold lil savage
no point in church cause the preacher cant keep them poles from clappin
it seem like evil and my soul attractin
hope for forgiveness for my sins while i load the ratchet
playin with bundles of that raw that dope get sold to addicts
forever scarred cause the way i lost my bros was tragic
