patience only gets you so far
blood will get you further
pain will only make your heart hard
tossed in furys weather
innocence is beautiful to see
wont you box it up for me for me
for me

prechorus
oh give me strength and give me peace
does anyone out there want to hear me

chorus
its just another downpour dont let it get the best of you
its only up from the floor light everything inside of you
dont burn out dont burn out on me
dont burn out dont burn out on me

verse 2
sadness is my enemy
i fear time will age him gently
walking by my side for all these years
seems that weve grown friendly
happiness is beautiful to see
wont you box it up for me for me
for me
