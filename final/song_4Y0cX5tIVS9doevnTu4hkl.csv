under this national rain cloud
im gettin soaked to the skin
tryin to find my umbrella
but i dont know where to begin
and its simply irrational weather
i cant even hear myself think
constantly bailin out water
but still feel like im gonna sink

chorus
cause im under the weather
just like the world
so sorry for bein so bold
when i turn out the light
youre out of sight
although i know that im not alone
it feels like home
feels like home

verse 2
you say you feel like a natural person
you havent got nothin to hide
so why do you feel imperfection
cut like a sword in your side
you might also likechorus
cause youre under the weather
just like the world
so sorry for bein so bold
when i turn out the light
youre out of sight
although i know that im not alone
feels like home

bridge
feels like home
feels like home
feels like home
yes it feels like home
yes it feels like home

chorus
oh cause im under the weather
just like the world
and i need somebody to hold
when i turn out the light
youre out of sight
although i know that im not alone
it feels like homeembed"
