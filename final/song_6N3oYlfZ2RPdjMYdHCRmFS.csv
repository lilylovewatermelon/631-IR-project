this one right here goes out for your mind and 2 and 12 and
to my homie with the dream nah mean uh

verse 1 lupe fiasco
he said i write what i see
write to make it right dont like where i be
id like to make it like the sights on tv
quite the great life so nice and easy
sí now you can still die from that
but its better than not being alive from straps
agreed a mead notebook and a bic that click when its pushed
and a wack ass beat
thats a track thats weak that he got last week
cause everybody in the stu was like thats that heat
a bassheavy medley with a sample from the 70s
with a screwedup hook that went stack that cheese
somethin somethin somethin stack that cheese
mother sister cousin stack that cheese
he couldnt think of nothin stack that cheese
he turns down the beat writers block impedes
crying from the next room a baby in need
of some pampers and some food and a place to sleep
that plus a black cadillac on ds
is what keep him on track to be a great mc yeah

verse 2 lupe fiasco
reps northside so he rocks them braids
1100 friends on his myspace page
stack that cheese got 700 plays
producer made him take it down said he had to pay
open mic champ two weeks in a row
ex dboy with a bboy flow
glow like leroy you should see boy go
got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
best homie in the grave tatted up while in the cage
minute maid got his momma working like a slave
down baby mama who he really had to honor
‘cause she was his biggest fan even let him use her honda
to drive up to dallas went to open up for amateurs
let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
told her when he get on he gon take her to the galleria
buy her everything but the mannequins ya dig

verse 3 lupe fiasco
his man called said your time might be now
they played your freestyle over wipe me down
they played it two times said it might be crowned
as the best thing out the htown in a while
he picked up his son with a great big smile
rapped every single word to the newborn child
then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
and put on another beat and got back to the mission of
get his momma out the hood put her somewhere in the woods
keep his lady looking good have her rolling like she should
show his homies theres a way other than that flippin yay
bail his homie out of jail put a lawyer on his case
throw a concert for the school show the shorties that its cool
throw some candy on the caddy chuck the deuce and act a fool
man it feels good when it happens like that
two days from going back to selling crack yessir
