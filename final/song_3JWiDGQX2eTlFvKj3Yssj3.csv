closed on sunday youre my chickfila
closed on sunday you my chickfila
hold the selfies put the gram away
get your family yall hold hands and pray
when you got daughters always keep em safe
watch out for vipers dont let them indoctrinate
closed on sunday you my chickfila
youre my number one with the lemonade
raise our sons train them in the faith
through temptations make sure theyre wide awake
follow jesus listen and obey
no more livin for the culture we nobodys slave

verse
stand up for my home
even if i take this walk alone
i bow down to the king upon the throne
my life is his im no longer my own
i pray to god that hell strengthen my hand
they will think twice steppin onto my land
i draw the line its written in the sand
try me and you will see that i aint playin
now back up off my family move your hands
i got my weapons in the spirits land
i jezebel dont even stand a chance
jezebel dont even stand a chance
