how can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes
how come weve both become a version of a person we dont even like
were in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down
by puttin ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
when i was a child every single thing could blow my mind
soaking it all up for fun but now i only soak up wine
they say to play hard you work hard find balance in the sacrifice
and yet i dont know anybody whos truly satisfied

prechorus
you better believe im tryin tryin tryin
to keep climbin climbin climbin
but the higher we climb feels like were both none the wiser

chorus
so i hope i learn to get over myself
stop tryin to be somebody else
so we can love each other for free
everybody wants somethin you just want me

verse 2
why am i obsessin about the things i cant control
why am i seekin approval from people i dont even know
in these crazy times i hope to find somethin i can cling on to
cause i need some substance in my life somethin real somethin that feels true

chorus

bridge
listen i know how low i can go i give as good as i get
you get the brunt of it all cause youre all ive got left
oh i hope in time hope in time
we both will find peace of mind we both find
sometimes the road less travelled is a road best left behind

chorus
well i hope i learn to get over myself
stop tryin to be somebody else
oh i just want to love you love you for free yeah
cause everybody wants somethin from me you just want me

refrain

outro
the only regret i have
i wish that it was just at a different time
a most turbulent period of my life
why would i put that on you
thats just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
but because of that period of time
even though it was so much fun
i didnt get to go on and make new memories with him
there was just memories in a big storm16embed"
