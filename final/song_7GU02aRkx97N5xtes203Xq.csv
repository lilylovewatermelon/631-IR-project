i got to tell you that he waited all his life
for someone like you to come make the wrong things right
i know he didnt have the answers all the time
but you cant tell me that youve never told a lie

chorus
were almost twentythree and youre still mad at me
so much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
twentythree and its so sad to me
you tell the world im dead to you
but i know you want me back now

verse 2
was it fun for you to watch him fall apart watch me fall
and suffocate him while you held him in your arms in your arms
i swear to god i wish he never let you in let you in
and i just hope we never hear from you again

chorus
were almost twentythree and youre still mad at me
so much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
twentythree and its so sad to me
you tell the world im dead to you
but i know you want me back now

outro
twentythree and youre still mad at me
so much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
twentythree and its so sad to me
you tell the world im dead to you
but i know you want me back nowembed"
