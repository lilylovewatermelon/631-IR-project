i havent thought of you for years you know
your memory seems to come and go
our time meant so much to me
now you cant be found

verse 2
you were the first to want me
the first to love me the first to need me
who was the last to know you
the last to love you
the last to hold you

chorus
its a wonderful wonderful life so wonderful
its a wonderful wonderful life so wonderful
its a wonderful wonderful life so wonderful
its such a wonderful wonderful life

verse 3
i thought of you again today
reminded me how with time ive changed
if you only knew what you gave to me
now you cant be found

verse 4
and you were the first i trusted
i learned what love is when we were just kids
when did you get so lost
and how could you think youd be better off
