ah

verse 1
i go walking each night
get a physical reaction
when youre on the path and my mind
metaphysical attraction
call it a curse from the full moon
flowin in my bloodstream
i can feel it like a monsoon
hoverin above me

prechorus
oh but i dont mind it
i cant escape the air
the wind always brings me the scent of her hair

chorus
ooh
all kinds of crazy youre makin me
i cant keep my mind off you
you got me losing my cool
got me actin like a fool
fool fool fool
yeah yeah yeah
fool fool fool
like a fool

i go walkin seaside hear the music of the ocean
swimmin through the wreckage of my mind in the deepest of emotions

prechorus
oh but i dont mind it
watchin you in the sand
the thought of you slippin through the cracks of my hands

chorus
ooh
all kinds of crazy youre makin me
i cant keep my mind off you
you got me losing my cool
got me actin like a fool
fool fool fool
yeah yeah yeah
fool fool fool
like a fool
ooh
all kinds of crazy youre makin me
i cant keep my mind off you
you got me losing my cool
got me actin like a fool
