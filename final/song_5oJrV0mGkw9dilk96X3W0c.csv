give me the wheel
so we can move a little faster
i make it real
im not a glorious disaster
what part of living says you gotta die
i plan on burning through another nine lives
one more for measure thats ten for the soul
that never sleeps so are you ready to go

chorus
bloodshot against the clear blue sky
tick tock i think the well is running dry
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
dead scared cause im fearless in the head
bang bang cause the needles in the red
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
my my my sweet adrenaline

verse 2
crack in the vision
who said the motivations all wrong
not your decision
the detonation of a time bomb
which way is up
when your high is low
its time to find it
are you ready to go

bloodshot against the clear blue sky
tick tock i think the well is running dry
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
dead scared cause im fearless in the head
bang bang cause the needles in the red
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
my my my sweet adrenaline

bridge
my my i just cant lie
its the speed and the sound that im dying to try
my my i just cant lie
its the love of the chase that created the ride

chorus
bloodshot against the clear blue sky
tick tock i think the well is running dry
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
dead scared cause im fearless in the head
bang bang cause the needles in the red
my my i cant lie
i need a shot again that sweet adrenaline
