verse 2 young thug
they hate the fact they gotta see me
cause im on flatscreens and poor people tv
i feed my dawgs and my bitch but they aint needy
five hundred thousand dollar bills on the ceiling
lil shawty natural with malaysian hair
the penthouse suite i just go bathe in there
i got mansions and exotic bitches in the living room
inside and outside pool its okay to drool lets go
you look like a fool tryna tie your tubes
aint talkin yeezys but the lambo got some new shoes
i could trick you up with red bottoms oh
before i ever try to deaden the problems i dont gotta say its
