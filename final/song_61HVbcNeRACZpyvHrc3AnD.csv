where the north wind meets the sea
theres a river full of memory
sleep my darling safe and sound
for in this river all is found

verse 2
in her waters deep and true
lie the answers and a path for you
dive down deep into her sound
but not too far or youll be drowned

bridge
yes she will sing to those wholl hear
and in her song all magic flows
but can you brave what you most fear
can you face what the river knows

verse 3
where the north wind meets the sea
theres a mother full of memory
come my darling homeward bound
when all is lost then all is foundyou might also like9embed"
