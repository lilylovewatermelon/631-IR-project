im feeling so afraid
cause everything that i do lately makes you angry
ive never been so ashamed
it really felt like you and me were getting better

prechorus
i hope that you still want me
i hope its not too late

dont walk away
and leave without a reason when theres
too much to say

i know i was wrong
and im sorry for making the same mistake
dont walk away

verse 2
can you really throw away
all the times that weve recovered one another
and i know i make it hard
but how long should i pay for being unappealing

i know you want to want me
i see it in your eyes
