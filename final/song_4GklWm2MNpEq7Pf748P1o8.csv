bitch we at every show
we got 40s we got nines we got every pole
call my chopper keyshia cole how i let it go
we gon wipe a nigga face like a runny nose
have to separate the real from the fake
to make this saint laurent coat i had to kill a snake
they talk behind your back and they smile in your face
thats what you call love i dont know what to say
every day my mom say watch your back
cause she know the streets is cold
and she know she didnt raise no ho

the police ride round with my picture i think i thug too much
and we aint gon pillowtalk to these hoes thats what i love bout us
bro called from the county i gave him a jail freak
when he get out ima give him 20k and chanel sneaks
and if my sister fight her boyfriend they gon tell me
and im parked outside my og crib every week yeah

i cock my gun i tell my kids that im coming home
we at the war with the city if we five strong
they into it with you they into it with me so you aint gon die alone yeah
