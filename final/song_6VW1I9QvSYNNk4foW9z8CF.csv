i could lose my heart tonight
if you dont turn and walk away
cause the way i feel i might
lose control and let you stay
cause i could take you in my arms
and never let go

chorus
i could fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you baby

verse 2
i can only wonder how
touching you would make me feel
but if i take that chance right now
tomorrow will you want me still baby will you want me
so i should keep this to myself
and never let you know

chorus
i could fall in love with you i could fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you baby

bridge
and i know its not right
and i guess i should try
to do what i should do
but i could fall in love
fall in love with you baby
i could fall in love with you

siempre estoy soñando en ti
besando mis labios acariciando mi piel
abrazándome con ansias locas
imaginando que me amas
como yo podria amar a tí
so i should keep this to myself
and never let you know

chorus
i could fall in love with you i could fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you baby
i could fall in love fall in love
i could fall in love fall in love
with you baby
i could fall fall in love with you i could fall in love with you
i could fall in love10embed"
