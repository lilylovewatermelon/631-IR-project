well work till you die thats all youll ever do
in this little town where i come from
aint got no option do what you gotta do
aint got much time for no fun
unless you roll it up in paper lord
or snort it up your nose
or drink it down like beer and moonshine
but you can retire early if you have enough fun
to a sixbythree box made of pine

chorus
and that neon right there beyond my barstool
made me feel much warmer than you ever did at home
and the older i get lord the more that i see
i will never be alone
as long as that neon stays on ive always got a place to call home

verse 2
and im a long way from temple hill
bout halfway down to georgia
i gotta be in atlanta by five
and the same ghost i left at home
followed me down here to dixie
makes me wonder how im even still alive
cause when that feeling comes over me lord
its hard to turn it down theres a thirst i can feel in my bones
and the troubles i ran from met me right there at the door
makes me feel like im right back at home
you might also likechorus
and that neon right there beyond my barstool
made me feel much warmer than you ever did at home
and the older i get lord the more that i see
i will never be alone
as long as that neon stays on lord ive always got a place to call homeembed"
