breathing in the dark lying on its side
the ruins of the dead painted with a scar
and the more i straighten out the less it wants to try
the feelings start to rot one wink at a time

chorus 1
ohoh
forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
just know that if you hide it doesnt go away
when you get out of bed dont end up stranded
horrified with each stone
on the stage my little dark age

verse 2
picking through the cards knowing whats nearby
the carvings on the face say they find it hard
and the engines failed again all limits of disguise
the humors not the same coming from denial

chorus 2
ohoh
i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide it doesnt go away
if you get out of bed and find me standing
all alone openeyed
burn the page my little dark age

little dark age little dark age
little dark age little dark age

chorus 3
i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
you know that if it hides it doesnt go away
if i get out of bed youll see me standing
all alone horrified
on the stage my little dark age

verse 3
giddy with delight seeing whats to come
the image of the dead dead ends in my mind

verse 4
policemen swear to god loves seeping from the guns
i know my friends and i would probably turn and run
if you get out of bed come find us heading
for the bridge bring a stone
all the rage my little dark age

chorus 4
i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide it doesnt go away
if you get out of bed and find me standing
all alone openeyed
burn the page my little dark age
outro
all alone openeyed
burn the page my little dark age96embed"
