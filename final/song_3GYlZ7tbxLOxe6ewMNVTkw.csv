i dont wanna talk right now
i just wanna watch tv
ill stay in the pool and drown
so i dont have to watch you leave
i put on survivor just to watch somebody suffer
maybe i should get some sleep
sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
whats the point of anything

chorus
all of my friends are missing again
thats what happens when you fall in love
you dont have the time you leave them all behind
you tell yourself its fine youre just in love

verse 2
dont know where you are right now
did you see me on tv
ill try not to starve myself
just because youre mad at me
and ill be in denial for at least a little while
what about the plans we made
the internets gone wild watching movie stars on trial
while theyre overturning roe v wade

now all of my friends are missing again
cause thats what happens when you fall in love
you dont have the time you leave them all behind
and you tell yourself its fine youre just in love

bridge
and i dont get along with anyone
