and then begin to breathe in
the darkest country road
and the strong scent of evergreen
from the passenger seat as
you are driving me home

then looking upwards
i strain my eyes and try
to tell the difference between
shooting stars and satellites
from the passenger seat as
you are driving me home

do they collide
i ask and you smile
with my feet on the dash
the world doesnt matter

if you feel embarrassed
then ill be your pride
if you need directions
then ill be the guide
for all time
for all timesee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likeembed"
