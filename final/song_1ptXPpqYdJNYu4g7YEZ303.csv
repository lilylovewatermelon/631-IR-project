verse
dope stash in my bimmer i can cash out on adidas
should i trap or should i rap and spend this cash all on a feature
my niggas is in the field and they adopted so i teach
but i gotta spend this cash all on this motherfuckin reup
im tryna be a leader but shit im fallin in my past
the trap callin for this cash i scrape the bottom of the stash
front a nigga one and i can press it i can stretch that bitch to half
a lot of shit a nigga never had a niggas tryna grab
and rip my nigga black cause they done chopped him into pieces
he was tryna duck polices i was tryna duck the reaper
i was on the block hustlin just tryna stuff the reefer
in the pocket with the nina shit im poppin with the heater if i need her
im in the kitchen bakin like anita tryna freak it like adina sell and sneak it to a beaner
i was younger was fuckin up the reup coppin sneakers
cause the ogs never taught me how to be up i got beat up
on them corners but i came back
trap back jumpin had it poppin on the same track
lil mama thuggin got my name as her face tat
shit you gotta face facts
its some real niggas in this shit you cant replace that
same block same strap shoot a nigga face back
leave his head in his legs waist in his wave cap
cocked the k back was blowin blades where his braids at
cocked the k back had so much pain so i stained that
mama cried tears we did bids throughout the years
i had a couple niggas die and im just wishin you was here but shit is clear
im ridin with my pistol like a piston through the fear and let them niggas know im here
i promise when i die they celebrate me like im pac
itll be because i reached my goal not cause i sold this rock
any nigga that try to hate me promise dawg they gon get shot
im from the dot and i got some niggas thats still down to knock your top
i put this on my baby this being broke shit done drove me crazy
all my friends done got ghost and went swayze
my numberone question now is lord am i gon make it
cause its times i feel alone and just so hopeless on this pavement
i tried to work a ninetofive but i cant wait for payment
shit that shit just take too long and plus the feelin so complacent
but i look at that road and its like my goals are so adjacent
the devil on my shoulder its gettin colder in this basement
i got killers on the left of me drug dealers on my right
to the world they look scary but i knew these niggas all my life
and now my little nigga scammin he tryna cop it off a swipe
i remember different nights duckin cops and runnin flights of stairs
niggas gettin scared but pussy boy that aint my type
i threw it up with niggas past my weight and twice my height
ever sat up in that dark place just tryna find a light
i cant even trust myself my left hand dont know my right
i can put this on my dead mama
marijuana sales done bought this ferragamo
out of state licks done got to flex some moncler on em
bitch im all smiles like the logo of the murakami
niggas cant stop me now they fearin on me
only thing i fear is god i can never fear the odds
eric committin a suicide the only time you seen the tears fall
shot my nigga nesta in his head they tried to clear em off
then my cousin dave got shot in front of grandmas
i been in them shootouts in the parkin lots and standoffs
real plugs where im from no niggas never ranned off
give it to my lil nigga pass it by the handoff
had to sell him game you gotta pass and put your man on
you might also likeoutro
cause even if i
even if i dont get it
then i might die trying
cause i was born broke but ima die rich
even if i
if i never get it
ill still have this dope stash when i blow past
sellin snow like its winter in the forecast
i gotta make it
i gotta make it
said i gotta make it
and if they wont give it to me im gon take it woah
i gotta make it
i gotta make it
and if they wont give it to me im gon take it1embed"
