baby when the band is playing and that solid beat
o make you wanna move make you wanna groove
make you wanna pat your feet
dont fight it dont fight feel it

baby when youre dancing near me
and i feel i wanna tease
and when i do the feeling gets you
when you feel you wanna squeeze
dont fight it dont fight feel it
feel it many times

baby when the swinging music makes you wanna flip
dont be in pain trying to restrain
go and move your hips
baby when youre dancing near me
and i feel i wanna tease
and when i do the feeling gets you
when you feel you wanna squeeze
dont fight it dont fight feel it

no now when we dance close together
with your cheek close to mine
and you begin to feel a funny little thrill
moving up your spine
dont fight it dont fight feel it

dont be in pain trying to restrain
go ahead and move your hipsembed"
