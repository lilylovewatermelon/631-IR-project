just a day just an ordinary day
just tryin to get by
just a boy just an ordinary boy but he was looking to the sky
and as he asked if i would come along
i started to realize
that every day he finds just what hes looking for
like a shooting star he shines
and said

chorus
take my hand
live while you can
dont you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand

verse 2
and as he spoke he spoke ordinary words
although they did not feel oh
for i felt what i had not felt before
and youd swear those words couldnt heal
and as i looked up into those eyes
his vision borrows mine
and i know hes no stranger
for i feel ive held him for all of time
and he said

take my hand

oh
in the palm of your hand

please come with me
see what i see
touch the stars for time will not flee
time will not flee
can you see

verse 3
just a dream just an ordinary dream
as i wake in bed
and the boy that ordinary boy
or was it all in my head

verse 4
did he ask if i would come along
it all seemed so real
but as i looked to the door
i saw that boy standing there with a deal
and he said
chorus
take my hand
live while you can oh
dont you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand
oh
in the palm of your hand
oh
in the palm of your hand

postchorus

outro
just a day just an ordinary day
just trying to get by
just a boy just an ordinary boy
but he was looking to the sky1embed"
