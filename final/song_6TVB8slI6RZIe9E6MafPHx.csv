the doors unlocked
and you dont even have to knock
or you can use the fireplace
ill be waiting either way

verse 1
you come and go
and no one is supposed to know
but ever since you caught my stare
you know i know that you are real
well santa ive been thinking
and i just need one thing
you to bring me
something shiny

chorus
like a diamond ring
just a little something from tiffanys
or a big ruby
you know red has always looked good on me
i wont tell anyone wont tell no one
ive been good all year long good all year long
oh santa make my christmas eve
four carats please

but ive been waiting up for you
and now the clock has just struck two
im looking out my windows
looking for a red nose
my hearts sinking

chorus
or my diamond ring
just a little something from tiffanys
or a big ruby
you know red has always looked good on me
i wont tell anyone wont tell no one
ive been good all year long good all year long
oh santa make my christmas eve
four carats please
