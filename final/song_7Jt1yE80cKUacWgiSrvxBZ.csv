ever since i was a little younger
i always had a ryhme that i flung up
any situation that you brung up
black eyed peas will shake a party like thunder
now everybody wanna ask and wonder
how the black eyed peas took it from the under
from the bottom to the top
now we make your body rock
mutha hey dont sit and ponder
cause we come with no bloops no blunders
we keep it fat like attila the huna
latin ladies by like ay caramba
we caliente like you chilling in the summer

my faith will never fall
forever remain myself after all
gainin fame mass appeal entertainin yall
never change or conform we always rock it raw
i remember when we used to bust at the mall
ways of expressin my love for the art
now we here to restore these rap laws
cause the way it is now is not the way i saw
so check it imma do it like this
so yall could recite this hip hop anthem once more
i wont let the mic rest you wont catch me rhymeless
no matter what the future got in store
