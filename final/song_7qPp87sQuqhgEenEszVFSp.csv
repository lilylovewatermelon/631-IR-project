take your suitcase and take your heart
take a train to the boulevard
my love will follow you my love will follow you
you can try to lose yourself downtown
you can burn all your bridges down
my love will follow you yeah my love will follow you

chorus
my love will follow you
down every highway of your soul
you can leave me far behind
but my love will be your shadow
everywhere you go

verse 2
so close the door turn in the key
leave me here like a memory
my love will follow you my love will follow you
even on a road that takes you down where
cords of human kindness come unwound
my love will follow you yeah my love will follow you

chorus

verse 3
if you should go so far that you can not get back
girl you may not remember but my heart will not lose track
so go ahead and take that train
in my heart youll still remain

oh follow you
my love will follow youembed"
