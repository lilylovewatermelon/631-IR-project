one is for envy and one just for spite
the cuts in my heart they show in your eyes
dont make it better the twisting knife turns all by itself
move on to someone else
your selfliberation will leave this behind
beyond slings and arrows that rain on our minds
youll make it better shake it off
it never mattered anyway

chorus
if we dont make it alive
well its a hell of a good day to die
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long
and its ashes to ashes again
should we even try to pretend
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long

verse 2
the banner youre waving is burning and red
its blocking the sunlight that shines overhead
you against the world diamonds and pearls
voices inside you churn watch the city burn
your own liberation will leave them behind
all the slings and arrows that rain on your mind
dont make it better break it cause
it never mattered anyway
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
if we dont make it alive
well its a hell of a good day to die
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long
and its ashes to ashes again
should we even try to pretend
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long

bridge
i wont calm down
the banner youre waving
is burning and red
you against the world diamonds and pearls
it never mattered mattered mattered
anyway

chorus
if we dont make it alive
well its a hell of a good day to die
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long
and its ashes to ashes again
should we even try to pretend
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long
all our light that shines strong
only lasts for so long3embed"
