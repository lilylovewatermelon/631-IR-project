spoken outro jim carrey
dont you dare touch that dial
because like the song says you are out of time
youre almost there but dont panic
theres still more music to come
before youre completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
soon youll be healed forgiven and refreshed
free from all trauma pain guilt and shame
you may even forget your own name
but before you dwell in that house forever
heres thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks
