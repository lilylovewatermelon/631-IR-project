this is one small step for woman
one giant leap for womankind

verse 1
id rather be alone tonight
you can say i love you through the phone tonight
really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
ill just use my covers to stay warm tonight
think im better off here all alone tonight
ain’t no checkin on when i get home tonight
just makin sure im good on my own tonight
even though there isnt nothin wrong tonight

prechorus
yeah im just sayin baby
i can’t really miss you if i’m with you
and when i miss you itll change the way i kiss you
baby you know time apart is beneficial
it’s like im the universe and you be nasa

chorus

ima need space i’ma ima need
you know im a star space ima need space
ima need space ima ima need space nasa
give you the whole world ima need space
ima need space ima ima need
you know im a star space ima need space
ima need space ima ima need space nasa

bottom line
usually i would love it if you stayed the night
i just think im on another page tonight
it aint nothing wrong with saying i need me time
usually i would orbit around you
but gravity seems to be the only thing thats pulling me
youll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align mmm

prechorus
baby i cant really miss you if im with you
and when i miss you itll change the way i kiss you
baby you know time apart is beneficial
its like im the universe and you be nasa

chorus
give you the whole world ima need space
ima need space ima ima need
you know im a star space ima need space
ima need space ima ima need space nasa
give you the whole world ima need space
ima need space ima ima need
you know im a star space ima need space
ima need space ima ima need space nasa

bridge
you dont wanna leave me but im tryna selfdiscover
keep me in your orbit and you know youll drag me under
you dont wanna leave me but im tryna selfdiscover
you dont wanna leave me but im tryna selfdiscover
keep me in your orbit and you know youll drag me under
keep me in your orbit and you know youll drag me under
