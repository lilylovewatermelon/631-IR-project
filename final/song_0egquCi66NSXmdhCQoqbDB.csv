i woke up on this side
i thought it was a dream
at first we learned to walk then learned to scream
you cant understand
when youre fed from a tv screen
and you cant see the things that i can see

prechorus
but i forget
that you thank god and pray
some things just never stay
and we all just slip away

chorus
this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it when i cant see the truth
welcome to the real world now
the old are carried in only to poison youth
am i the only one who thinks its tragic
cause i know this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh

verse 2
i look for some hope
in every face theres a vacant stare
the shadows come but no one seems to care
the darkness floods
every light that could promise change
she passed sound asleep when the blood is stain
but blood is pain
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeprechorus
somewhere i know
that im not all alone
with this bated breath i hold
my lungs want to explode

chorus
this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it when i cant see the truth
welcome to the real world now
the old are carried in only to poison youth
am i the only one who thinks its tragic
cause i know this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh

bridge
just as soon as we see
every flaw and every need well understand
and for the first time time
a child to a man says only pure words that he can
and hes too late this man he knows it he said
with all emotions set aside in a whisper say goodbye

chorus
this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it when i cant see the truth
welcome to the real world now
the old are carried in now just to poison youth
am i the only one who thinks its tragic
cause i know this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh
this cant be the real world
this cant be the real world
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh oh no ohoh1embed"
