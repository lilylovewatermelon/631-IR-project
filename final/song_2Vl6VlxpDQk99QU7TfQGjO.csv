you sent a text
its like the wind changed your mind
we were best friends
yeah we were building a life

prechorus
with every kiss and every letter
every promise of forever
oh but you hit send
and disappeared in front of my eyes

chorus
and now youre just a ghost
when i look back never woulda known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020 i see through you now

verse 2
something has died
now that i have made up my mind
ill be alright ill be alright
it doesnt haunt me at night
prechorus
cause every gift and every letter
every promise of forever
now is out of sight
like you were never alive

chorus
and now youre just a ghost
when i look back never woulda known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020 i see through you now

bridge
now now now now now
now now now now now
so rest in peace
ill see you on the other side

chorus
and now youre just a ghost
when i look back never woulda known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres an echo theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
oh and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020 i see through you now
