im singin at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and ive been talking to his dad it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i cant breathe
and i have this dream where im screamin underwater
while my friends are all waving from the shore
and i dont need you to tell me what that means
i dont believe in that stuff anymore
chorus
jesus christ im so blue all the time
and thats just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

verse 2
i have a friend i call
when ive bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears
and last night i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else feeling sorry for myself
when i remembered someones kid is dead

jesus christ im so blue all the time
and thats just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

outro
and its 4am again
and im doing nothing
