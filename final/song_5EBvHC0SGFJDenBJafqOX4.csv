well king midas put his hands on me again
he said one day id realize why i dont have any friends
why i find myself alone at night unless im having sex
but he can make me golden if i just showed some respect

refrain
but i dont let him touch me anymore
i said im not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
cause i have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
to find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door

prechorus
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late

chorus
and now i cant stop thinking that i cant stop thinking
that i almost gave you everything
and now the whole things finished and i cant stop wishing
that i never gave you anything

you wrote a hundred letters just for me
and i find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
now im constantly reminded of the time i was nineteen
every single ones forgotten in a laundromat machine

refrain
but i dont let him touch me anymore
i said im not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
cause i have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
to find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door

prechorus
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late

chorus
and now i cant stop thinking that i cant stop thinking
that i almost gave you everything
and now the whole things finished and i cant stop wishing
that i never gave you anything
and i cant stop thinking that i cant stop thinking
that i almost gave you everything i said its too late
and now the whole things finished and i cant stop wishing
that i never gave you anything
outro
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late
he said please dont go away
he said please dont go away
i said its too late
i said its too late30embed"
