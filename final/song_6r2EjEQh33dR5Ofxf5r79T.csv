go on just say it
you need me like a bad habit
one that leaves you defenseless dependent and alone
are you afraid to say what you want to tell me you want to
go on just say it
you need me like a bad habit
one that leaves you defenseless dependent and alone
are you afraid to say what you want to tell me you want to

verse 1
well i hold my tongue use it to assess
the damage from way back when it mattered
but nothing seems important anymore
we’re just protecting ourselves from our self
and i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back
i don’t think i’ll ever come back

chorus 2
are you ashamed to say what you want to tell me you want to
are you ashamed to say what you want to tell me you want to
go on just say it
are you ashamed to say what you want to tell me you want to
go on just say it
go on just say it
are you ashamed to say what you want to tell me you want to
go on just say it
go on just say it

i’m making the difference
it just seems pointless
with all the obvious lines got out of focus
why can’t you just be happy
why can’t you just be happy
and i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back down
i don’t think i’ll ever come back
i don’t think i’ll ever come back
