when the morning came
we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
cause we lost track of time again
laughing with my feet in your lap
like you were my closest friend
howd we end up on the floor anyway you say
your roommates cheapass screwtop rosé thats how
i see you every day now

chorus
and i chose you
the one i was dancing with
in new york no shoes
looked up at the sky and it was
the burgundy on my tshirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet it was
the mark thеy saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew bеtween telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet it was maroon

verse 2
when the silence came
we were shaking blind and hazy
how the hell did we lose sight of us again
sobbing with your head in your hands
aint that the way shit always ends
you were standing holloweyed in the hallway
carnations you had thought were roses thats us
i feel you no matter what
the rubies that i gave up
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likechorus
and i lost you
the one i was dancing with
in new york no shoes
looked up at the sky and it was maroon
the burgundy on my tshirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet it was maroon
the mark they saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew between telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet it was maroon

bridge
and i wake with your memory over me
thats a real fucking legacy legacy it was maroon
and i wake with your memory over me
thats a real fucking legacy to leave

chorus
the burgundy on my tshirt
when you splashed your wine into me
and how the blood rushed into my cheeks
so scarlet it was maroon
the mark they saw on my collarbone
the rust that grew between telephones
the lips i used to call home
so scarlet it was maroon
outro
it was maroon
