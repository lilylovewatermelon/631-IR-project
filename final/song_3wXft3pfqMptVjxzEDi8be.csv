bite your tongue bite your tongue on purpose
said you really need to see me in person
im on my way yeah you make it sound urgent
when i see you feel like i be done searching
serious seriously broken
yeah i really need to see you not joking
but i really need some time to be open
i dont really mean the words that ive spoken

chorus
i really like you in the morning
these feelings got me talking too much
and ill be here till sunday
ill see you again someday

verse 2
ayy ayy i gotta fix it
when wе all alone all i wanna do is kiss it
when im getting homе i dont know but i can text you
when im in the street look good take a picture
take a picture take a picture take a picture
do you miss me
say you gotta work today boy go and get your money
pay me up to separate us if you feeling lucky
bottle up my feelings so much one day you wont love me
one day you might love me ayy ayy ayy
see omar apollo liveget tickets as low as 127you might also likebridge
he got questions i can answer them all night long
catch a flight now i gotta go
i just never wanna be alone
doing good on my own
if you know then i gotta know
make me fall like a domino

chorus
i really like you in the morning
these feelings got me talking too much
and ill be here till sunday
ill see you again someday

instrumental
