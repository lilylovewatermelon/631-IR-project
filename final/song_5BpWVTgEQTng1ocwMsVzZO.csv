all those dirty words jusqu la fin
they make us look so dumb en plein soleil
been drinking far too much jusqu la fin
and neither of us mean what we say en plein amour
chorus damon albarn
well you and i collapsed in love
and it looks like we might have made it
yes it looks like weve made it to the end

verse 2 damon albarn  lætitia sadier
what happened to us jusqu la fin
soon it will be gone forever en plein soleil
infatuated only with ourselves jusqu la fin
and neither of us can think straight any more en plein amour
chorus damon albarn
well you and i collapsed in love
and it looks like we might have made it
yes it looks like weve made it to the end
when you and i collapsed in love
well it looks like we might have made it
yes it looks like weve made it to the end
