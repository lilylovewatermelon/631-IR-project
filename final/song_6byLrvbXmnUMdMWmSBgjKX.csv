you go ahead
there’s something i forgot
walk slow and i’ll catch up
let’s hear the stars do their talking
i used to love caves
stumble out into that pink sky
remember that bright hollow moon
it showed our insides on our outsides

chorus
this town closes down the same time every day
put out the smoke in your mind
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away

verse 2
now i think i like birds
see them fly from st paul
and i go running when the night aches
i hear her every time she calls
did i hear something break
was that your heart or my heart
like when the earth shakes
then the silence that follows

this town closes down the same time every day
put out the smoke in your mind
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away

outro
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words away
let’s put all these words awayembed"
