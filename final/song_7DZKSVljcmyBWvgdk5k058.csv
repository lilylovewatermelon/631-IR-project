1 int car engine  night 1

were close on a maze of metal rods tubes and wires its only
as we pull out that we realize its the engine of a car over
the image we hear a voice talking on a phone
driver os
hundred thousand streets in this city
you dont need to know the route you give
me a time and place i give you a five
minute window those five minutes im
yours whatever goes down im yours minute
either side youre on your own

as the engine ignites and roars to life we dissolve to

2 int low rent apartment koreatown la  night 2

a map of downtown la spread out on a bed dozens of different
routes marked in pencil the voice continues 

driver os

reach me at this number again

driver hangs up the phone he folds his map of la and slips it
in his duffel bag a few clothes and other essentials are neatly
packed inside he zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
cheap tv set on screen a movie is playing on a radio the la
clippers are taking a pounding from the new york knicks

scanner he switches it on tuning it to the right frequency
crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
commentary now

doesnt react expecting them they cut through the fence with
bolt cutters and approach the main building driver watches them
pull on their masks then one of them takes out a shotgun and
blasts the lock to the front door instantly the alarm shrills
the only thing driver does is to turn on his stop watch

basketball commentary

the stop watching keeps ticking away the siren blaring the
commentary continuing the police scanner crackling

suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows running as
fast as he can to the getaway car he jumps into the back seat a
few seconds short of five minutes and driver screeches off

12 int ext silver impala streets downtown  night 12

through the dimly lit industrial zone unaware its being

clippers have the lead 71 to 69 seven to
go in the fourth here at the staples

driver turns the sound back down up ahead the police car
swings left disappearing from view driver slows down too
anticipating the next obstacle he doesnt have long to wait in
the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
choppers searchlights sweeping the area one more time

driver floors the gas speeding straight towards the approaching
helicopter the armed robbers are too stunned to protest they
just sit there watching the sweeping searchlights getting
closer and closer

then suddenly it becomes clear what drivers doing up ahead
theres a small underpass below the 7th street bridge driver
slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
choppers searchlights spot them

stares out then turns on a stop watch listening to it tick
finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual

81 ext pawn shop tarazana la  day 81

another anonymous la store front drivers parked the car a
hundred yards from the entrance his police scanner crackling
standard sits beside him in the passenger seat looking tense

driver

standard
forcing a smile
what are you talking about

he tries to make light of it but doesnt sound convincing out
of his window he sees blanche cross the street and enter the
pawn shop and looks even more nervous now

standard

you know that right

driver glances at him sensing his anxiety

standard

he forces a smile slips on his sunglasses then finally opens
the door

driver

standard
grinning
ill see you in four

driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
foreboding standard enters the pawn shop driver starts his
stopwatch now listening to the seconds tick away

he casts his eyes around the street observing the smallest
details  the number plates of other vehicles the windows of
overlooking buildings

the white hot sun blazes down reflecting on the pawn shop
windows hiding everything inside

the police scanner crackles but picks up no activity driver
listens to his stop watch in his own world he starts the
engine and sets off cruising slowly past the pawn shop heading
for the corner where he told standard hed be waiting

he pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something
parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
glinting in the sunlight to the ordinary eye its no different
from the other cars parked nearby but to driver it stands out
for one its a chrysler secondly it has reinforced bumpers
and racing tires

drivers stopwatch shows four minutes now he looks away from
the chrysler gazing at the doors of the pawn shop expecting
standard and blanche to burst out at any moment

but theres no sign of them

the seconds tick away five minutes driver hesitates all his
instincts telling him to drive off but he stays where he is
thinking of irene

suddenly he sees standard and blanche emerge from the pawn shop
standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand

he smiles at driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
crack of gunshots behind him driver sees the look of panic on
his face as he spins around

a guy in a suit strides out of the pawn shop crouching low in
an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots the
force of the bullets sends standard flying

driver sees him hit the sidewalk arterial blood pumping from
his neck blanche screams grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
the back seat of the car driver hesitates takes one last look
at standards lifeless body then hits the gas as more gunshots
crack behind him

as drivers car roars down the street the chrysler suddenly
comes to life pulling out of its parking place

82 int ext car street tarzana la  day 82

driver glances in his rearview mirror and sees the chrysler on
his tail it doesnt seem to be trying to close the gap just
following at a discreet distance in the back seat blanche zips
open the gym bag then stares in shock

blanche
christ there wasnt supposed to be this
much money

there are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
inside the gym bag driver catches her reaction in the mirror
but his attention is focussed on the chrysler up ahead at an
intersection the lights turn red driver thinks about running
them but decides against it braking sharply the chrysler
draws up beside him its windows glinting in the sunlight

blanche
move for chrissakes

driver ignores her still watching the chrysler out of the
corner of his eye the lights change to green but driver doesnt
move nor does the chrysler behind them other cars start
honking their horns suddenly driver roars off swerving left at
speed

the chrysler reacts screeching off in pursuit

driver floors the gas on speed and power his vehicle may be no
match for the chrysler but in traffic the odds are even he
weaves his way past the slower cars putting obstacles between
himself and the chrysler the pursuing car matches him move for
move staying on his tail

in the back seat blanche looks terrified buckling herself in

driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
deserted canyon road the mustang somehow manages to make
the same turn it gets close enough to pit driver its nose
pressing against the rear corner of drivers vehicle

drivers almost run off the road but manages to save it and
regains control of his car

the mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
him as it moves in to deliver the knockout blow driver
pulls the emergency brake and spins 180 degrees causing the
mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment

now the two cars are nose to nose barrelling down the road
driver heading in reverse as fast as he can the mustang
closing fast

it rams drivers front bumper bam the two cars separated
for an instant

the mustang guns it ready to smash into driver again

driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
construction equipment in a last ditch attempt to evade his
pursuer he throws a reverse 180 then incredibly keeps going
spinning 270 degrees

the mustang tries to make the same turn but this time the
maneuver is beyond his ability drivers suckered him into a
corner he cant control

the mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
sickening crunch of metal on metal

driver guns the motor and speeds away

of a man crossing the curtains someones outside the door

theres the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom

driver reacts in an instant rushing towards the bathroom door
he has to barge it open something obstructing his way

87 int bathroom motel room  day 87

driver almost trips over blanches sprawled body as he bursts
through one quick glance and he knows shes dead  half her
head blown off another quick glance and he sees her killer a
big burly hitman trying to climb through the same bathroom
window where he just shot her

driver moves like lightning grabbing the mans arms before he
can get off another shot and pulling him through the window the
hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass cutting his
forehead open blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes

driver takes his opportunity and slams the mans face back into
the glass strewn floor stunning him for a few more seconds as
they struggle crawling away he grabs the towel rack and pulls
the metal bar off the wall using it as a spear he impales the
hitman and grabs his shotgun

88 int motel room  day 88

in the bedroom the 2nd hitman finally kicks the door open
driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time 
firing the 1st shooters shotgun the force of the blast picks
up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
doll

the startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
it began driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion his hand and
his arm ripped open by the broken glass theres blood splatter
all over the wall neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
mans face but no panicked footsteps or sirens yet

driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
pockets all he finds are a set of car keys

bernie rose
suns in my eyes

nino doesnt look at cook a clear indication he should do as
hes told cook stands up humiliated and walks over to the
windows bernie rose waits for nino to explain

nino
the money belonged to a half assed
wiseguy from philly i had a tipoff he was
keeping a million in a pawn shop and was
gonna invest it here in la try to run a
rival operation i wanted to teach him a
lesson

the lights in the restaurant gradually fade as cook shuts the

bernie rose
the money always flows up izzy you know

he calls nino by his childhood name now emphasizing the fact
that theyre both outsiders in this organization for the first
time ninos tough guy act slips and he looks anxious

nino

people who can tie me to the robbery

two broken hands he stares back dumbly and its the final
straw bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
in his eye as cook screams bernie takes a knife and buries it
in his neck he twists the knife deeper for good measure then
with one powerful sweep of his arm clears cook off the table

cooks not dead yet just writhing on the floor choking on his
own blood bernie rose keeps his eyes fixed on nino
