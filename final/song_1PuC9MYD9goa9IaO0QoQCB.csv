verse 1
people told me i should write a love song
girl you sound so angry you could use some variation
but im lonely negative relations
ive been hurt so many times i dont have the patience

prechorus
but ive wished for so long
for someone to come and show me lead by example
cause ive been waiting
ive tried every age im so tired of the game
i i wanna be somebodys girl
would you show me the way

chorus
what if i never find and im left behind
should i keep hoping for love
what if im still the same status doesnt change
gotta keep hoping for love
what is love what is love what is love
somebody show me
what is love what is love what is love
cause if you told me
what is love what is love what is love
i wouldnt be lonely what is love
please show me what is love
