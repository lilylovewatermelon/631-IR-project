i just wanna be numb i dont wanna feel a thing
i dont want reality actually reality stings
how about we just pretend that your cellphone didnt even ring
and that i wasnt on the other side of the door listening to everything
tell me another lie

i dont wanna know what i know to be true
what i need you to do tell me another lie
i dont wanna know what i know to be true
what i need you to do tell me another lie
i dont wanna know what i know to be true
what i need you to do tell me another lie
i dont wanna know what i know to be true
what i need you to do tell me another lie
