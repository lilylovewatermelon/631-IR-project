sun comes up on another morning
my mind never wakes up without you on it
and its crazy to me
i even see you in my dreams
is this meant to be
could this be happening to me yeah
we were best of friends since we were this high
so why do i get nervous every time you walk by
we would be on the phone all day
now i cant find the words to say to you
now what am i supposed to do

chorus
could it be a possibility
im tryna see whats up
its been me for you and you for me
maybe now is time for us
tryna keep it all together but enough is enough
they say were too young for love but im catching feelings
catching feelings girl

verse 2
in my head were already together
im good alone but with you im better
i just want to see you smile
just say the word and ill be right there
i aint never going nowhere
im just tryna see where this can take us
cause everything about you girl is so contagious
i think i finally got it down
and all thats left to do now is get out the mirror
and say it to her yeah
you might also likechorus
could it be a possibility
im tryna see whats up
its been me for you and you for me
maybe now is time for us
tryna keep it all together but enough is enough
they say were too young for love but im catching feelings
catching feelings girl

bridge
should i tell her how i really feel
should i move in close or just be still
how will i know
cause if i take a chance and i touch her hand will everything change
how do i know if she feels the same oh

chorus
could it be a possibility
im tryna see whats up
its been me for you and you for me
maybe now is time for us
tryna keep it all together but enough is enough
they say were too young for love but im catching feelings
catching feelings girl
