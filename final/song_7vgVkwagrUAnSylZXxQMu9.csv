she dont cook she dont clean
she aint never found the knob on the washing machine
she dont iron she dont sew
says why waste time folding clothes
she aint never gonna get mamas recipe right
but she knows what to do with a saturday night

chorus
hit every hot spot all around town
turn it on up shell tear it on down
people rubber necking trying to see her dance
she got a belly button ring and some lowrider pants
they call me lucky i know thats right
she knows what to do with a saturday night

verse 2
she makes a mean margarita and a singapore sling
and if yall are into skynard she sure can sing
shes gonna run the table if you let her break
she might pop out of the top of a birthday cake
and that little black dress painted on tight
she knows what to do with a saturday night

chorus
hit every hot spot all around town
turn it on up shell tear it on down
people rubber necking trying to see her dance
she got a belly button ring and some lowrider pants
they call me lucky i know thats right
she knows what to do with a saturday night
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
we get home in the early am
thats when all the real fun begins
yeah she holds me close and whispers in my ear
every little sweet thing i want to hear
then she lights them candles and out go the lights
she knows what to do with a saturday night
yeah they call me lucky i know thats right
she knows what to do with a saturday night
saturday night
with a saturday night
saturday nightembed"
