a visit from albertine — prospect of rich brides for certain friends of saintloup — the wit of the guermantes as displayed before the princesse de parme — a strange visit to m de charlus — his character puzzles me more and more — the red shoes of the duchess

   albeit it was simply a sunday in autumn i had been born again life lay intact before me for that morning after a succession of mild days there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday a change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew formerly when the wind howled in my chimney i would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if like the famous bowtaps with which the c minor symphony opens they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things the mist from the moment of my awakening had made of me instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days a selfcentred man longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch a shivering adam in quest of a sedentary eve in this different world

   between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate i tried to account for all the originality of the physical intellectual and moral life which i had taken with me about a year earlier to doncières and which blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside — always present even when it was invisible — formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others incommunicable to my friends in the sense that the impressions richly interwoven with one another which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them to my subconscious mind than any facts that i might have related from this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me which only made it more real and forgotten for some time which restored all its novelty and i was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired notably a series of ‘mornings at doncières’ including my first morning there in barracks and another in a neighbouring country house where i had gone with saintloup to spend the night in which from the windows whose curtains i had drawn back at daybreak before getting into bed again in the first a trooper in the second on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their halflights which emerge from an obliterated fresco

   it was from my bed that i was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories for i had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which taking advantage of the absence of my parents who had gone for a few days to combray i proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in mme de villeparisis’s drawingroom had they been at home i should perhaps not have ventured to go out my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother’s memory wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given she would not have forbidden me this outing she would have disapproved of it from combray on the other hand had i consulted her wishes she would not have replied in a melancholy “do just as you like you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong” but reproaching herself for having left me alone in paris and measuring my grief by her own would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance would have advised me to take

   that morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted its disagreeable sound — an intermittent hiccough — had no part whatsoever in my memories of doncières but its prolonged encounter in me this afternoon with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever after succeeding more or less in forgetting it i heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them

   there was no one else in the house but françoise the grey light falling like a fine rain on the earth wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the sunday holidaymakers appeared in a silvery sheen i had flung to the foot of my bed the figaro for which i had been sending out religiously every morning ever since i had sent in an article which it had not yet printed despite the absence of the sun the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only halfway through the afternoon the tulle windowcurtains vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies’ wings have and venetian glass it depressed me all the more that i should be spending this sunday by myself because i had sent a note that morning to mlle de stermaria robert de saintloup whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting — after painful and abortive attempts — from his mistress and who immediately afterwards had been sent to morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love had sent me a line which had reached me the day before announcing his arrival presently in france for a short spell of leave as he would only be passing through paris where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with rachel he informed me to shew me that he had been thinking of me that he had met at tangier mile or rather mme for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage de stermaria and robert remembering what i had told him at balbec had asked her on my behalf to arrange a meeting she would be delighted to dine with me she had told him on one of the evenings which before her return to brittany she would be spending in paris he warned me to lose no time in writing to mme de stermaria for she would certainly have arrived before i got his letter this had corne as no surprise to me even although i had had no news of him since at the time of my grandmother’s last illness he had accused me of perfidy and treachery it had then been quite easy to see what must have happened rachel who liked to provoke his jealousy — she had other reasons also for wishing me harm — had persuaded her lover that i had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence it is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation but he had ceased to be in love with her which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him and our friendship alone remained when on meeting him again i attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile which gave him the air of begging my pardon then he turned the conversation to something else all this was not to say that he did not a little later see rachel occasionally when he was in paris the fellowcreatures who have played a leading part in one’s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality they return to take their old place in it at odd moments so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love before leaving it for ever saintloup’s breach with rachel had very soon become less painful to him thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money jealousy which prolongs the course of love is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination if one takes with one when one starts on a journey three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the ponte vecchio or the persian church shrouded in mist one’s trunk is already pretty full when one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad until one has begun to forget her that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one’s mind’s eye of whom that is to say one is jealous all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing now frequent demands for money from a castoff mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness but the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill and the former furnish a presumption vague enough it is true that the forsaken one or forsaker whichever she be cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors and so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one’s sufferings while he responds to it at once by dispatching money for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything except lovers one of the three lovers he has in his mind’s eye until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor sometimes rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover’s permission to lie down beside him until the morning this was a great comfort to robert for it refreshed his memory of how they had after all lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep he realised that she was more comfortable lying close to his body than she would have been elsewhere that she felt herself by his side — even in an hotel — to be in a bedroom known of old in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better he felt that his shoulders his limbs all of him were for her even when he was unduly restless from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose

   to revert to where we were i had been all the more disquieted by robert’s letter in that i could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly “you can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room” he told me “she is a charming young person a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her and i am sure you will have a capital evening together” as my parents were returning at the end of the week on saturday or sunday and as after that i should be forced to dine every evening at home i had written at once to mme de stermaria proposing any evening that might suit her up to friday a message was brought back that i should hear from her in writing the same evening about eight o’clock the time would have passed quickly enough if i had had during the afternoon that separated me from her letter the help of a visit from anyone else when the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count or indeed to notice them they vanish and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time but if we are alone our preoccupation by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum divides or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which had we been with friends we should not have counted and confronted by the incessant return of my desire with the ardent pleasure which i was going to taste — not for some days though alas — in mme de stermaria’s company this afternoon which i should have to spend by myself seemed to me very empty and very melancholy

   every now and then i heard the sound of the lift coming up but it was followed by a second sound not that for which i was hoping namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when i was expecting a visitor remained for me at other times even when i had no wish to see anyone a sound lugubrious in itself in which there echoed as it were a sentence of solitary confinement weary resigned busy for several hours still over its immemorial task the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade and it saddened me to think that i was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work paid no attention to the person present with her in the room suddenly although i had heard no bell françoise opened the door to let in albertine who came forward smiling silent plump containing in the fulness of her body made ready so that i might continue living them come in search of me the days we had spent together at that balbec to which i had never since returned no doubt whenever we see again a person with whom our relations — however trivial they may have been — are altered it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods for this we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend all that we need is the visit to paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life and that this life should have ceased for us were it no more than a week ago on each of albertine’s smiling questioning blushing features i could read the questions “and madame de villeparisis and the dancingmaster and the pastrycook” when she sat down her back seemed to be saying “gracious there’s no cliff here you don’t mind if i sit down beside you all the same as i used to do at balbec” she was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time in this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms with albertine however there was something more than this certainly even at balbec in our daily encounters i had always been surprised when she came in sight so variable was her appearance from day to day but now it was difficult to recognise her cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them her features had emerged like those of a statue she had another face or rather she had a face at last her body too had grown there remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which at balbec her future outline had been barely visible

   this time albertine had returned to paris earlier than usual as a rule she came only in the spring which meant that already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers i did not distinguish in the elements of the pleasure that i felt the return of albertine from that of the fine weather it was enough that i should be told that she was in paris and that she had called at the house for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea i cannot say whether it was the desire for balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy cowardly and incomplete method of possessing balbec as if to possess a thing materially to take up one’s abode in a town were equivalent to possessing it spiritually besides even materially when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea but sitting still in a room with me she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose so poor indeed that i would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals and to imagine instead that i was inhaling the salt air on the beach

   i must say it at this point albeit i was not then aware of what was to happen only later on certainly it is more reasonable to devote one’s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuffboxes even to pictures or statues only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes to have not one woman only but several those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a seabeach of the braided hair of a statue in church of an old print of everything that makes one see and admire in her whenever she appears a charming composition those suggestions are not very stable live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her though i must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy if after a long period of life in common i was to end by seeing nothing more in albertine than an ordinary woman an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at balbec would still suffice perhaps to reincorporate in her to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide only as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal we cannot under so dangerous a form regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired but i am anticipating the course of years and here i need only state my regret that i did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses never so complete in their cabinet that there is not room always for another and rarer still

   departing from the customary order of her holiday movements this year she had come straight from balbec where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual it was a long time since i had seen her and as i did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in paris i could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me these lasted often for quite a time then one fine day in would burst albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce

   this time however certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life and yet perhaps all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which albertine had now reached for instance her intellect was now more in evidence and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making sophocles write “my dear racine” she was the first to laugh quite wholeheartedly at her own stupidity “andrée was quite right it was stupid of me” she admitted “sophocles ought to have begun ‘sir’” i replied that the ‘sir’ and ‘dear sir’ of andrée were no less comic than her own ‘my dear racine’ or gisèle’s ‘my dear friend’ but that after all the really stupid people were the professors who still went on making sophocles write letters to racine here however albertine was unable to follow me she could not see in what the silliness consisted her intelligence was dawning but had not fully developed there were other more attractive novelties in her i felt in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed something that was different and in those lines which in one’s eyes and other features express one’s general attitude towards life a change of front a partial conversion as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which i had hurled my strength in vain at balbec one evening now remote in time on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement since then it had lieen she who was lying down and i who sat by her bedside wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed every time that she rose to go i asked her to stay beside me a little longer this was a concession not very easy to obtain for albeit she had nothing to do otherwise she would have rushed from the house she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me scarcely to be at ease in my company and yet each time after looking at her watch she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything the things i was saying to her followed logically those that i had said during the hours before and bore no relation to what i was thinking about what i desired from her remained indefinitely parallel there is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one’s mind time presses and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed we then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied or rather preluded by a gesture supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it without a word said without even a ‘by your leave’ already made this gesture certainly i was not in the least in love with albertine child of the mists outside she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent as the body of eve barely holds by the feet to the side of adam to whose body hers is almost perpendicular in those romanesque basreliefs on the church at balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion still almost like a classical frieze the creation of woman god in them is everywhere followed as by two ministers by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises — like winged swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared — cupids from herculaneum still surviving well into the thirteenth century and winging their last slow flight weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them over the whole front of the porch
you might also like   as for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which i should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman had i been asked upon what — in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which i took care to keep from albertine the one thing that was in my mind — was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances i should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due while the forgotten outlines of albertine’s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them thus she said to roe that elstir was stupid and on my protesting

    “you don’t understand” she replied smiling “i mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that of course i know he’s quite a distinguished person really”

   similarly wishing to say of the fontainebleau golf club that it was smart she declared “they are quite a selection”

   speaking of a duel that i had fought she said of my seconds “what very choice seconds” and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me ‘wear a moustache’ she even went so far and my chance appeared then enormous as to announce in a phrase of which i would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier that since she had last seen gisèle there had passed a certain ‘lapse of time’ this was not to say that albertine had not already possessed when i was at balbec a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one’s people are in easy circumstances and which year by year a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her gradually as the girl grows up on important occasions her own jewels it was evident that albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her she had said “i am quite confused” mme bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was

   “gad she’s old for fourteen”

   the approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when albertine speaking of another girl whose tone was bad said “one can’t even tell whether she’s pretty she paints her face a foot thick” finally though still a schoolgirl she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said of some one whose face twitched “i can’t look at him because it makes me want to do the same” or if some one else were being imitated “the absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her” all these are drawn from the social treasury but it did not seem to me possible that albertine’s natural environment could have supplied her with ‘distinguished’ used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised “it appears he’s quite a distinguished person” ‘selection’ even when used of a golf club seemed to me as incompatible with the simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective ‘natural’ with a text published centuries before the researches of darwin ‘lapse of time’ struck me as being of better augury still finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals the nature of which was unknown to me but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when albertine announced with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised

    “to my mind that is the best thing that could possibly happen i regard it as the best solution the stylish way out”

   this was so novel so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her that on hearing the words ‘to my mind’ i drew albertine towards me and at ‘i regard’ made her sit on the side of my bed

   no doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture on marrying wellread men receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia and shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night when they begin to pay calls and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if in deciding that some person is intelligent they sound both l’s in the word but that is precisely the sign of a change of state and i could see a difference when i thought of the vocabulary of the albertine i had known of old — a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person ‘he’s a type’ or if you suggested a game of cards to her ‘i’ve no money to lose’ or again if any of her friends were to reproach her in terms which she felt to be undeserved ‘that really is magnificent’ an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middleclass tradition almost as old as the magnificat itself and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs as the saying is ‘quite naturally’ that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend all these expressions mme bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the jews and her feeling for black which was always suitable and becoming indeed without any formal instruction but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones recently hatched so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also but when all was said ‘selection’ appeared to me of alien growth and ‘i regard’ encouraging albertine was no longer the same which meant that she would not perhaps act would not react in the same way

   not only did i no longer feel any love for her but i had no longer to consider as i should have had at balbec the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself which no longer existed there could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me i was well aware that to her i was in no sense a member now of the ‘little band’ into which i had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission besides as she had no longer even as in balbec days an air of frank good nature i felt no serious scruples still i believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery as continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which i hid my intimate desire i spoke having albertine secure now on the corner of my bed of one of the girls of the little band one smaller than the rest whom nevertheless i had thought quite pretty “yes” answered albertine “she reminds me of a little mousmé” there had been nothing in the world to shew when i first knew albertine that she had ever heard the wordmousmé it was probable that had things followed their normal course she would never have learned it and for my part i should have seen no cause for regret in that for there is no more horrible word in the language the mere sound of it makes one’s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one’s mouth but coming from albertine as she sat there looking so pretty not even ‘mousmé‘ could strike me as unpleasant on the contrary i felt it to be a revelation if not of an outward initiation at any rate of an inward evolution unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her goodbye if i wished her to reach home in time for her dinner and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own it was françoise who was getting it ready she did not like having to keep it back and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that albertine in the absence of my parents should be paying me so prolonged a visit and one which was going to make everything late but before ‘mousmé‘ all these arguments fell to the ground and i hastened to say

    “just fancy i’m not in the least ticklish you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and i won’t even feel it”

    “really”

    “i assure you”
   she understood doubtless that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part for like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you

    “would you like me to try” she inquired with womanly meekness

    “just as you like but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed”

    “like that”

    “no get right on top”

    “you’re sure i’m not too heavy”

   as she uttered these words the door opened and françoise carrying a lamp came in albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair perhaps françoise had chosen this moment to confound us having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole but there was no need to suppose anything of the sort she might have scorned to assure herself by the use of her eyes of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears her prudence her alertness her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea the quarry of the hunter and of the malady if not the physician often at any rate the patient the amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them her sources were no larger they were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen again her mistakes were due like theirs like the fables in which plato believed rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal only the other day has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort but if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal — and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries — the limitations under which she worked had done more in this case the impediment not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination had greatly strengthened it of course françoise never let slip any artificial device those for example of diction and attitude since if she never believed what we said to her hoping that she would believe it she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her however absurd which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity so the accents in which she reported the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers and won from them by treating them before all the world like dirt any number of privileges and concessions shewed that the story was to her as gospel françoise went so far as to add “i’m sure if i had been the mistress i should have been quite vexed” in vain might we despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor shrug our shoulders as though at an unlikely fable at this report of so shocking an example in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing the lacerating force of the most unquestionable most irritating affirmation

   but above all just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion so françoise not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion spoke like tiresias and would have written like tacitus she managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves indeed in less than a sentence in a silence in the way in which she placed a thing in a room

   thus when i happened to leave by accident on my table among a pile of other letters one which it was imperative that she should not see because let us say it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer that evening if i came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room there on top of my letters neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of françoise placed by her right at the top almost separated from the rest in a prominence that was a form of speech that had an eloquence all its own and as i stood in the doorway made me shudder like a cry she excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects intended so to enlighten the spectator in her absence that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance she possessed for thus making an inanimate object speak the art at once inspired and painstaking of irving or frédéric lemaître on this occasion holding over albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girl’s body had hollowed in the counterpane françoise made one think of a picture of ‘justice throwing light upon crime’ albertine’s face did not suffer by this illumination it revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at balbec this face of albertine the general effect of which sometimes was out of doors a sort of milky pallor now shewed according as the lamp shone on them surfaces so dazzlingly so uniformly coloured so firm so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of françoise i exclaimed

    “what the lamp already i say the light is strong”

   my object as may be imagined was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion by the first to excuse my lateness in rising françoise replied with a cruel ambiguity

    “do you want me to extinglish it”

    “— guish” albertine slipped into my ear leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question when françoise had left the room and albertine was seated once again on my bed
    “do you know what i’m afraid of” i asked her “it is that if we go on like this i may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you”

    “that would be a fine pity”

   i did not respond at once to this invitation which another man might even have found superfluous for albertine’s way of pronouncing her words was so carnal so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you a word from her was a favour and her conversation covered you with kisses and yet it was highly attractive to me this invitation it would have been so indeed coming from any pretty girl of albertine’s age but that albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty i recalled the original albertine standing between me and the beach almost painted upon a background of sea having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal’s part or at a mere projection from a lantern then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass had come towards me with the sole result that i had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures i had learned that it was not possible to touch her to embrace her that one might only talk to her that’ for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables are really fruit and now she was appearing to me in a third plane real as in the second experience that i had had of her but facile as in the first facile and all the more deliciously so in that i had so long imagined that she was not my surplus knowledge of life of a life less uniform less simple than i had at first supposed it to be inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism what can one positively affirm when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true and alas i was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to albertine in any case even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life an attraction the opposite of that which saintloup had felt during our dinners at rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them in a calm face features to which his lips had once been pressed the knowledge that to kiss albertine’s cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them what a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies one’s body alone because she is no more than a piece of flesh and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl had lent one for the study of her first one optical instrument then another and had added to one’s carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires more spiritual and less easily assuaged which do not emerge from their torpor leaving carnal desire to move by itself when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile rise in a tempest round about it enlarge extend it are unable to follow it to the accomplishment the assimilation impossible in the form in which it is looked for of an immaterial reality but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection of return furnish it afresh with their escort to kiss instead of the cheeks of the first comer however cool and fresh they might be but anonymous with no secret with no distinction those of which i had so long been dreaming would be to know the taste the savour of a colour on which i had endlessly gazed one has seen a woman a mere image in the decorative setting of life like albertine outlined against the sea and then one has been able to take that image to detach it to bring it close to oneself gradually to discern its solidity its colours as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope it is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult whose resistance one does not at once overcome of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it are alone interesting for to know them to approach them to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form in dimensions in relief the human image is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of one’s life the women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable

   in addition albertine preserved inseparably attached to her all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which i was particularly fond i felt that it was possible for me on the girl’s two cheeks to kiss the whole of the beach at balbec

    “if you really don’t mind my kissing you i would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment only you mustn’t forget that you’ve said i may i shall want a voucher ‘valid for one kiss’”

    “shall i have to sign it”

    “but if i took it now should i be entitled to another later on”

    “you do make me laugh with your vouchers i shall issue a new one every now and then”

    “tell me just one thing more you know at balbec before i had been introduced to you you used often to have a hard calculating look you can’t tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that”

    “no i don’t remember at all”

    “wait this may remind you one day your friend gisèle put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in try to remember what was in your mind at that moment”

    “gisèle was the one we saw least of she did belong to the band i suppose but not properly i expect i thought that she was very illbred and common”

    “oh is that all”

   i should certainly have liked before kissing her to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before i knew her to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still for that at any rate if i knew nothing of it i could substitute all my memories of our life at balbec the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window the shouts of the children but when i let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys i could not help saying to myself “now at last after failing at balbec i am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in albertine’s cheeks and since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few perhaps i ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that i had chosen from among all others i shall have brought it into this new plane in which i shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips” i told myself this because i believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips i told myself that i was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose because i had never stopped to think that man a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the seaurchin or even the whale is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing the place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk but a pair of lips designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite must be content without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek besides at such moments at the actual contact between flesh and flesh the lips even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment they are alone the sense of sight then that of smell have long since deserted them to begin with as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss my eyes changing their position saw a different pair of cheeks the throat studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face

   apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography — which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which time and again when we stood near them have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers drill and deploy like a regiment in file in open order in mass the same famous and familiar structures bring into actual contact the two columns on the piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart thrust away the adjoining dome of the salute and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge in the embrasure of a window among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others — i can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate in short just as at balbec albertine had often appeared to me different so now as if wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters i had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature and to draw out one from another like a nest of boxes all the possibilities that it contains in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten albertines that i saw this single girl being like a goddess with several heads that which i had last seen if i tried to approach it gave place to another at least so long as i had not touched it that head i could still see it a faint perfume reached me from it but alas — for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped — suddenly my eyes ceased to see next my nose crushed by the collision no longer perceived any fragrance and without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire i learned from these unpleasant signs that at last i was in the act of kissing albertine’s cheek

   was it because we were enacting — as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body — the converse of our scene together at balbec because it was i now who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown no doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of ‘finishing off’ a wounded man and that of bringing him relief between a sublime and a hideous portrait not knowing whether i had to give the credit and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months in paris or at balbec had been working on my behalf i supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it it was quite another explanation however that albertine offered me this in short “oh well you see that time at balbec i didn’t know you properly for all i knew you might have meant mischief” this argument left me in perplexity albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it so difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall

   in any case whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love another far more surprising manifested itself in albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice which indeed i had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the champselysées

   the exact opposite happened already when i had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her albertine had assumed an air which i did not remember in her of docile good will of an almost childish simplicity obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests the moment preceding pleasure similar in this respect to the moment after death had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood and no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest devoted charming especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure he is himself happy in the display of it anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible but in this new expression on albertine’s face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness conscience generosity a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion and it was farther than to her own childhood it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation which i had finally secured albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything she who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago now presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties said when i reminded her of her dinner

    “oh but that doesn’t matter in the least i have plenty of time”

   she seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened embarrassed by good manners just as françoise when without feeling thirsty she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which jupien offered her would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained however urgent the call of duty albertine — and this was perhaps with another which the reader will learn in due course one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her — was one of the incarnations of the little french peasant whose type may be seen in stone at saintandrédeschamps as in françoise who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy i recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger a sense of decency of respect for the bedside

   françoise who after the death of my aunt felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone would in the months that preceded her daughter’s marriage have been quite shocked if when the young couple walked out together the girl had not taken her lover’s arm albertine lying motionless beside me said

    “what nice hair you have what nice eyes you are a dear boy”

   when after pointing out to her that it was getting late i added “you don’t believe me” she replied what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours

    “i always believe you”

   she spoke to me of myself my family my social position she said “oh i know your parents know some very nice people you are a friend of robert forestier and suzanne delage” for the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me but suddenly i remembered that i had indeed played as a child in the champselysées with robert forestier whom i had never seen since then as for suzanne delage she was the greatniece of mme blatin and i had once been going to a dancing lesson and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mother’s drawingroom but the fear of being sent into fits of laughter and of a bleeding nose had made me decline so that i had never set eyes on her i had at the most a vague idea that i had once heard that the swanns’ governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the delages but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess or a friend i protested to albertine that robert forestier and suzanne delage occupied a very small place in my life “that may be but your mothers are friends i can place you by that i often pass suzanne delage in the avenue de messine i admire her style” our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of mme bontemps who having heard that i had at one time played with robert forestier to whom it appeared i used to recite poetry had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties she could never i gathered hear my mother’s name mentioned without observing “oh yes she is in the delage forestier set” giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve

   apart from this albertine’s social ideas were fatuous in the extreme she regarded the simonnets with a double ‘n’ as inferior not only to the simonets with a single ‘n’ but to everyone in the world that some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him of course there are exceptions it may happen that two simonnets introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to converse no matter on what subject and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery finding that they have the same name will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion but that is only an exception plenty of people are of dubious character but we either know nothing or care nothing about them if however a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them or vice versa we at once feel a mistrust often justified as to their moral worth we are afraid of being confused with them we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing when we read our own name as borne by them in the newspaper they seem to have usurped it the transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold we lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes the hatred which we bear towards the other simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity after the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other simonnets we know nothing of the reason we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder until as is not uncommon the time comes when a male and female simonnet who are not related in any way are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach

   not only did albertine speak to me of robert forestier and suzanne delage but spontaneously with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates that is to say at first before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other she told me a story about her own family and one of andrée’s uncles as to which at balbec she had refused to utter a word thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which i might not share from this moment had her dearest friend said anything to her against me she would have made it her duty to inform me i insisted upon her going home and finally she did go but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless

    “are you laughing at me” i inquired

    “i am not laughing i am smiling at you” she replied lovingly “when am i going to see you again” she went on as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us since it is generally the crowning consummation might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship a friendship already existing which we should have to discover to confess and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves

    “since you give me leave i shall send for you when i can” i dared not let her know that i was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing mme de stermaria “it will have to be at short notice unfortunately” i went on “i never know beforehand would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings when i am free”

    “it will be quite possible in a little while i am going to have a latchkey of my own but just at present it can’t be done anyhow i shall come round tomorrow or next day in the afternoon you needn’t see me if you’re busy”

   on reaching the door surprised that i had not anticipated her she offered me her cheek feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another the brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel

   when she had left me this young picard who might have been carved on his porch by the imagemaker of saintandrédeschamps françoise brought me a letter which filled me with joy for it was from mme de stermaria who accepted my invitation to dinner from mme de stermaria that was to say for me not so much from the real mme de stermaria as from her of whom i had been thinking all day before albertine’s arrival it is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal the only one that we shall ever possess one which the arbitrary power of memory almost as absolute as that of imagination may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real balbec the balbec of my dreams an artificial creation to which by degrees and to our own hurt we shall force the real woman into resemblance

   albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when i entered mme de villeparisis’s drawingroom and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out discussing the great piece of news the separation said to be already effected of the duc de guermantes from his wife i had until i should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room when from the other in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all i saw emerging majestic ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies the duchess herself the sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least there had been a day when laying her hands on my forehead as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings and saying “you really must stop hanging about trying to meet mme de guermantes all the neighbours are talking about you besides look how ill your grandmother is you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you” in a moment like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be and opens one’s eyes for one or like the doctor who by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging one’s fancy my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream the rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which i was renouncing i had sung for hours on end and weeping as i sang the sad words of schubert’s adieu

   farewell strange voices call thee
   away from me dear sister of the angels

and then it had finished i had given up my morning walks and with so little difficulty that i thought myself justified in the prophecy which we shall see was to prove false later on that i should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman and when shortly afterwards françoise had reported to me that jupien anxious to enlarge his business was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood wishing to find one for him quite happy moreover when strolling along a street which already from my bed i had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milkgirls with their white sleeves i had been able to begin these excursions again nor did i feel the slightest constraint for i was conscious that i was no longer going out with the object of seeing mme de guermantes much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it what troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person in one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her in the next it was the other way about in another a hardworking mother beaten black and blue by a drunkard son was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours quite half of the human race was in tears and when i came to know the people who composed it i saw that they were so exasperating that i asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband who were in the right presently i ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to jupien for continuing my morning wanderings for we learned that the cabinetmaker in our courtyard whose workrooms were separated from jupien’s shop only by the flimsiest of partitions was shortly to be ‘given notice’ by the duke’s agent because his hammering made too much noise jupien could have hoped for nothing better the workrooms had a basement for storing timber which communicated with our cellars he could keep his coal in this he could knock down the partition and would then have a huge shop all in one room but even without the amusement of househunting on his behalf i had continued to go out every day before luncheon just as jupien himself finding the rent that m de guermantes was asking him exorbitant was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope thatdiscouraged by his failure to find a tenant the duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer françoise noticing that even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the guer — mantes footman they would find a lovers’ retreat there and to catch them redhanded

   however that might be and for all that i had no longer to find jupien a new shop i still went out before luncheon often on these excursions i met m de norpois it would happen that conversing as he walked with a colleague he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before for with these eminent diplomats looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them a tall woman whom i frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me for in spite of the fact that i did not know her she would turn round to look at me would wait for me unavailingly before shop windows smile at me as though she were going to kiss me make gestures indicative of a complete surrender she resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew for a long time now in these morning walks thinking only of what i had to do were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper i had chosen the shortest way with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the duchess followed in her walks and if on the other hand it lay along that course without either compunction or concealment because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which i should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will but it had never occurred to me that my recovery when it restored me to a normal attitude towards mme de guermantes would have a corresponding effect on her and so render possible a friendliness even a friendship in which i no longer felt any interest until then the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an illstarred love fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula “i am no longer in love” i had been vexed with saintloup for not having taken me to see his aunt but he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment so long as i was in love with mme de guermantes the marks of politeness that ï received from others their compliments actually distressed me not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them and yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me indeed among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove an absence the declining of an invitation to dinner an unintentional unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world there would be plenty of social success were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding

   as she swept through the room in which i was sitting her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom i did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party mme de guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while i was in love i had tried so desperately without ever succeeding to assume an air of indifference she swerved aside came towards me and reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the opéracomique which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate “no don’t move you don’t mind if i sit down beside you for a moment” she asked gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa

   of less stature than she who was further expanded by the volume of her gown i was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me having barely room to sit down she could not turn easily to face me and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction assumed the sort of dreamy sweet expression one sees in a portrait

    “have you any news of robert” she inquired

   at that moment mme de villeparisis entered the room

    “well sir you arrive at a fine time when we do see you here for once in a way” and noticing that i was talking to her niece concluding perhaps that we were more intimate than she had supposed “but don’t let me interrupt your conversation with oriane” she went on and for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess “you wouldn’t care to dine with her here on thursday”

   it was the day on which i was to entertain mme de stermaria so i declined
“saturday then”

   as my mother was returning on saturday or sunday it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her i therefore declined this invitation also

    “ah you’re not an easy person to get hold of”

    “why do you never come to see me” inquired mme de guermantes when mme de villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value for it had cost no more than twenty francs this incidentally was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the marquise

    “it’s such a bore that we never see each other except in other people’s houses since you won’t meet me at dinner at my aunt’s why not come and dine with me” various people who had stayed to the last possible moment upon one pretext or another but were at length preparing to leave seeing that the duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both thought that they must have been misinformed that it was the duchess and not the duke who was seeking a separation and on my account whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence i had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood but i was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect the duchess instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a — person whom she knew so slightly the suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked

   a minute earlier i should have been stupefied had anyone told me that mme de guermantes was going to ask me to call on her let alone to dine with her i might be perfectly aware that the guermantes drawingroom could not furnish those particular refinements which i had extracted from the name of its occupants the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawingrooms of which we have read the description in a novel or seen the image in a dream made me even when i was certain that it was just like any other imagine it as quite different between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends to dine with the guermantes was like travelling to a place i had long wished to see making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes forming acquaintance with a dream at the most i might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which one’s hosts invite one with “do come there’ll beabsolutely nobody but ourselves” pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege reserved for their intimates alone the quarantine of the outsider hopelessly uncouth whom they are befriending i felt on the contrary that mme de guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violethued loveliness of a visit to fabrice’s aunt with the miracle of an introduction to count mosca

    “on friday now couldn’t you there are just a few people coming the princesse de parme who is charming not that i’d ask you to meet anyone who wasn’t nice”

   discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades such as the lower middle class and the semiroyal aristocracy which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it from its own special point of view there exists nothing higher the friendship shewn me by her ‘aunt villeparisis’ and robert had perhaps made me for mme de guermantes and her friends living always upon themselves and in the same little circle the object of a curious interest of which i had no suspicion

   she had of those two relatives a familiar everyday homely knowledge of a sort utterly different from what we imagine in which if we happen to be comprised in it so far from our actions being at once ejected like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe they are capable of remaining engraved and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs

   people who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided but the guermantes door was not that hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it if for once in a way the duchess had one pointed out to her she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive she thought only of his real merits both mme de villeparisis and saintloup had testified to mine doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me and therefore that i attached no importance to worldly things which seemed to the duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called ‘nice people’

   it was worth seeing when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care how her face changed as soon as one named in connexion with one of these let us say her sisterinlaw “oh she is charming” the duchess would exclaim in a judicious confident tone the only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the marquise de chaussegros and the princesse de silistrie she did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself the duchesse de guermantes this had nevertheless been the case and ever since the mind of the duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know she was dying to be invited to call on her people in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention was the true motive in the mind of mme de guermantes for thus inviting me now that i was no longer in love with her that i did not run after her relatives although apparently run after myself by them i cannot say in any case having made up her mind to invite me she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again those whom she knew to be boring i had not known to what to attribute her change of direction when i had seen her deviate from her stellar path come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect we picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly — such as in my case the duchesse de guermantes — as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us as a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part so that while in our solitary silence like that of a cloudless night we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on venus or cassiopeia an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip

   perhaps now and then when following the example of the persian princes who according to the book of esther made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service mme de guermantes consulted her list of the welldisposed she had said to herself on coming to my name “a man we must ask to dine some day” but other thoughts had distracted her

   beset by surging cares a prince’s mind
   towards fresh matters ever is inclined

   until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like mordecai at the palace gate and the sight of me having refreshed her memory sought like ahasuerus to lavish her gifts upon me

   i must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which i had felt on hearing mme de guermantes ask me to dine with her since i had decided that it would shew greater modesty on my part and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me mme de guermantes who was getting ready to go on to another final party had said to me almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was since i appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her “you know i’m the aunt of robert de saintloup who is such a friend of yours besides we have met before” in replying that i was aware of this i added that i knew also m de charlus “who had been very good to me at balbec and in paris” mme de guermantes appeared dumbfoundered and her eyes seemed to turn as though for a verification of this statement to some page already filled and turned of her internal register of events “what so you know palamède do you” this name assumed on the lips of mme de guermantes a great charm due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure but for her was no more than her brotherinlaw and the cousin with whom she had grown up and on the confused greyness which the life of the duchesse de guermantes was for me this name palamède shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl at guermantes in the garden moreover in this long outgrown period in their lives oriane de guermantes and her cousin palamède had been very different from what they had since become m de charlus in particular entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that i was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the duchess was at this moment unfurling she could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her i was completely unaware that the baron possessed all these talents of which he never spoke let me remark in passing that m de charlus did not at all relish being called ‘palamède’ by his family that the form ‘mémé’ might not please him one could easily understand these stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own poetic beauty in jewry too we may see the same defect since a nephew of lady israels whose name was moses was commonly known as ‘momo’ concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic now m de charlus had in this connexion a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride but the reason for his distaste for ‘mémé’ could not be this since it extended also to the fine name palamède the truth was that considering knowing himself to come of a princely stock he would have liked his brother and sisterinlaw to refer to him as ‘charlus’ just as queen marieamélie and duc d’orléans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons brothers and nephews as ‘joinville nemours chartres paris’

    “what a humbug mémé is” she exclaimed “we talked to him about you for hours he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance just as if he had never set eyes on you you must admit he’s odd and — though it’s not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brotherinlaw i’m devoted to and really do admire immensely — a trifle mad at times”

   i was struck by the application of this last epithet to m de charlus and said to myself that this halfmadness might perhaps account for certain things such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that i should ask bloch to castigate his mother i decided that by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them m de charlus must be a little mad the first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor one is surprised by his tone so different from the conversational but observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural one says nothing about it to other people one says nothing in fact to oneself one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn at the most one may think of an actor at the théâtrefrançais “why instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes” or of a labori “why whenever he opened his mouth did he utter those tragic unexpected sounds to express the simplest things” but as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them so upon thinking it over one said to oneself that m de charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech it seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with “but why do you shout so why are you so offensive” only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right and one took one’s place in the circle which applauded his outbursts but certainly at certain moments a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac

    “but are you sure you’re not thinking of some one else do you really mean my brotherinlaw palamède” went on the duchess a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity

   i replied that i was absolutely sure and that m de charlus must have failed to catch my name

    “oh well i shall leave you now” said mme de guermantes as though she regretted the parting “i must look in for a moment at the princesse de ligne’s you aren’t going on there no you don’t care for parties you’re very wise they are too boring for words if only i hadn’t got to go but she’s my cousin it wouldn’t be polite i am sorry selfishly for my own sake because i could have taken you there and brought you back afterwards too so i shall say goodbye now and look forward to friday”

   that m de charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by m d’argencourt was all very well but that to his own sisterinlaw who had so high an opinion of him besides he should deny all knowledge of me knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that i was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew was a thing that i could not understand

   i shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in mme de guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten had she never seen me waylaying her following her tracking her down as she took her morning walks had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience had she never refused saintloup when he begged her to invite me to her house she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations in hints allusions or ambiguous smiles not only was there in her present affability without any harking back to the past without any reticence something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory or at least from her manner that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind

   but if i was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her had there not been a time during which i could regain life and strength only if — always building new castles in the air — i had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and after this initial boon would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart it was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave paris for doncières to visit robert de saintloup and now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that i was agitated but on account this time of mme de stermaria not of mme de guermantes

   let me add further to conclude my account of this party that there occurred at it an incident contradicted a few days later which continued to puzzle me interrupted for some time my friendship with bloch and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work at this party at mme de villeparisis’s bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by m de charlus who when he passed him in the street looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him was anxious to know him personally knew quite well who he was i smiled at first bloch having expressed so vehemently at balbec his contempt for the said m de charlus and i supposed merely that bloch like his father in the case of bergotte knew the baron ‘without actually knowing him’ and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absentmindedness but finally bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions m de charlus had wished to address him that remembering that i had spoken of my friend to the baron who had as we walked away together from this very house as it happened asked me various questions about him i came to the conclusion that bloch was not lying that m de charlus had heard his name realised that he was my friend’ and so forth and so a little later at the theatre one evening i asked m de charlus if i might introduce bloch to him and on his assenting went in search of my friend but as soon as m de charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment instantly repressed appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury not only did he not offer bloch his hand but whenever bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner in an angry and wounding tone so that bloch who according to his version had received nothing until then from the baron but smiles assumed that i had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which knowing m de charlus’s liking for formal procedure i had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced bloch left us his spirit broken like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle and did not speak to me again for six months

   the days that preceded my dinner with mme de stermaria were for me by no means delightful in fact it was all i could do to live through them for as a general rule the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective the longer it seems to us because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all the papacy we are told reckons by centuries and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all since its goal is in eternity mine was no more than three days off i counted by seconds i gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete — those identical caresses to the exclusion of all others and as a matter of fact it is true that generally speaking the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire the difficulty not the impossibility for that suppresses it altogether yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised at a fixed and not distant point in time is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty almost as much as an anxious doubt the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony what i required was to possess mme de stermaria for during the last few days with an incessant activity my desires had been preparing this pleasure in my imagination and this pleasure alone for any other kind pleasure that is taken with another woman would not have been ready pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish and of one which is not always the same but changes according to the endless combinations of one’s fancies the accidents of one’s memory the state of one’s temperament the variability of one’s desires the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten i should not have been prepared i had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridlepath of a particular desire i should have had — in order to wish for a different assignation — to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path to take possession of mme de stermaria on the island in the bois de boulogne where i had asked her to dine with me this was the pleasure that i imagined to myself afresh every moment it would have automatically perished if i had dined on that island without mme de stermaria but perhaps as greatly diminished had i dined even with her somewhere else besides the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure they dictate the pleasure and the place as well and on that account bring to the fore alternatively in our capricious fancy this or that woman this or that scene this or that room which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt child of the attitude that produced her one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side while others to be caressed with a more secret intention require leaves blown by the wind water rippling in the night are as frail and fleeting as they

   no doubt in the past long before i received saintloup’s letter and when there was as yet no question of mme de stermaria the island in the bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure because i had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter it is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island and along which in the last weeks of summer those ladies of paris who have not yet left for the country take the air that not knowing where to look for her or if indeed she has not already left paris one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawingroom until the following spring feeling it to be at least the eve if not the morrow of the beloved’s departure one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose one scans that horizon where by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass our eyes passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of meudon and the mont valérien do not know where to set the boundary and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike among the surrounding woods an exotic note between the last festivity of summer and one’s winter exile one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lover’s melancholy and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped universe than if at versailles looking down from the terrace an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of van der meulen after having thus risen above the bounds of nature one were informed that there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal the villages which one just could not make out on a horizon as dazzling as the sea were called fleurus or nimègue

   and then the last carriage having rolled by when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now one goes to dine on the island above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky a few drops of rain fall without noise on the water ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers and after the geraniums have vainly striven by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet to resist the gathering darkness a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island one walks in the moist dimness along the water’s edge where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like in a bed at night the eyes for a moment wide open and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake then one would like to have with one a loving companion all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world

   but to this island where even in summer there was often a mist how much more gladly would i have brought mme de stermaria now that the cold season the back end of autumn had come if the weather that had prevailed since sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living — as other seasons made them balmy luminous italian — the hope of in a few days’ time making mme de stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise twenty times in an hour a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination in any event the mist which since yesterday had risen even in paris not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom i had invited to dine with me but since it was probable that far more thickly than in the streets of the town it must after sunset be invading the bois especially the shores of the lake i thought that it would make the swans’ island for me something like that breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of mme de stermaria of course when we are young at the age i had reached at the period of my walks along the méséglise way our desires our faith bestow on a woman’s clothing an individual personality an ultimate quintessence we pursue reality but by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing something solid subsists which is what we have been seeking we begin to separate to recognise what we love we try to procure it for ourselves be it only by a stratagem then in the absence of our vanished faith costume fills the gap by means of a deliberate illusion i knew quite well that within half an hour of home i should not find myself in brittany but in walking arm in arm with mme de stermaria in the dusk of the island by the water’s edge i should be acting like other men who unable to penetrate the walls of à convent do at least before enjoying a woman clothe her in the habit of a nun

   i could even look forward to hearing as i sat with the lady the lapping of waves for on the day before our dinner a storm broke over paris i was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted and order the food for our dinner next day when françoise came in to tell me that albertine had called i made her come in at once indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin her for whom at balbec i had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as mme de stermaria was costing me now the latter i was determined must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together accordingly i asked albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food she to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has afresh at every moment without any hope of future reward at my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath albertine’s flat cap which came down very low to her eyebrows seemed to hesitate she had probably other plans if so she sacrificed them willingly to my great satisfaction for i attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner

   it is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at balbec but our intimacy even when we do not consider it close enough at the time with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love then in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach an avenue towards others we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if after giving a cabman an address in the boulevard des capucines or the rue du bac thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there we remind ourself that the names were once those of respectively the capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the seine

   at the same time my balbec desires had so generously ripened albertine’s body had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that as we drove through the bois while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees brought down the fruit swept up the fallen leaves i said to myself that had there been any risk of saintloup’s being mistaken or of my having misunderstood his letter so that my dinner with mme de stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result i should have made an appointment for the same evening later on with albertine so as to forget for a purely voluptuous hour as i held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for mme de stermaria and certainly if i could have supposed that mme de stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting i should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her i knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self — how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her we have without ever having talked to her hesitated tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us shall it be this woman or another and lo our dreams become fixed round about her cease to have any separate existence from her the first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love nothing of the sort as if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also in love with her already we talk to her in the most trivial fashion “i asked you to dine on this island because i thought the surroundings would amuse you i’ve nothing particular to say to you don’t you know but it’s rather damp i’m afraid and you may find it cold —” “oh no not at all” “you just say that out of politeness very well madame i shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour as i don’t want to bother you but in fifteen minutes i shall carry you off by force i don’t want to have you catching a chill” and without another word said we take her home remembering nothing about her at the most a certain look in her eyes but thinking only of seeing her again well at our second meeting when we do not find even that look our sole memory of her but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again the first stage is passed nothing has happened in the interval and yet instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant we say without our words appearing to surprise the new person who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life “we are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way do you think we shall be successful do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies — live happily ever afterwards and all that sort of thing” but these conversational openings trivial to begin with then hinting at love would not be required i could trust saintloup’s letter for that mme de stermaria would yield herself to me from the first i should have no need therefore to engage albertine to come to me as a makeshift later in the evening it would be superfluous robert never exaggerated and his letter was explicit

   albertine spoke hardly at all conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere we went a little way on foot into the greenish almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt i trod underfoot dead leaves which like shells were trampled into the soil and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as seaurchins

   on the boughs the last clinging leaves shaken by the wind followed it only as far as their stems would allow but sometimes these broke and they fell to the ground along which they coursed to overtake it i thought with joy how much more remote still if this weather lasted the island would be on the morrow — and in any case quite deserted we returned to our carriage and as the storm had passed off albertine asked me to take her on to saintcloud as on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind and a stream of migrant evenings of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers pink blue and green were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes to obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her filled it with the mythological terror half animal half divine of her frenzied bounding albertine climbed a grassy slope while i waited for her in the road she herself seen thus from below no longer coarse and plump as a few days earlier on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person but chiselled and delicate seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at balbec had left their patina when i found myself alone again at home and remembered that i had taken a drive that afternoon with albertine that i was to dine in two days’ time with mme de guermantes and that i had to answer a letter from gilberte three women each of whom i had once loved i said to myself that our social existence is like an artist’s studio filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love but it did not occur to me that sometimes if the sketch be not too old it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different and possibly more important than what we had originally planned

   the next day was cold and fine winter was in the air — indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged bois a few domes of gilded green when i awoke i saw as from the window of the barracks at doncières a uniform dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar then the sun withdrew and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon night fell early i made ready for dinner but it was still too soon to start i decided to send a carriage for mme de stermaria i did not like to go for her in it myself not wishing to force my company on her but i gave the driver a note for her in which i asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her while i waited for her answer i lay down on my bed shut my eyes for a moment then opened them again over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter i recognised that wasted hour the large anteroom of pleasure the dark delicious emptiness of which i had learned at balbec to know and to enjoy when alone in my room as i was now while all the rest were at dinner i saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains knowing that presently after a night of arctic brevity it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of rivebelle i sprang from my bed tied my black necktie passed a brush over my hair final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom i should see at rivebelle while i smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room gestures which on that account had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled like magic signs they summoned nay rather presented this entertainment already thanks to them i had of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as i had had at combray in the month of july when i heard the hammerblows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed in the coolness of my darkened room a sense of warmth and sunshine

   also it was no longer exactly mme de stermaria that i should have wished most to see forced now to spend my evening with her i should have preferred as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from rivebelle i gave my hands one more final wash and my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move dried them as i walked through the shuttered diningroom it appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what i had taken for the bright chink of the door which as a matter of fact was closed was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before mamma’s return i thought of all the other illusions of the sort which i had discovered in different parts of the house and which were not optical only for when we first came there i had supposed that our nextdoor neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on and the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself very gently caught by a draught on the staircase without rendering those broken voluptuous whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of overture to tannhäuser i had moreover just as i had put my towel back on its rail an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment for at a peal of the bell i hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with mme de stermaria’s answer i thought that his message would be “the lady is downstairs” or “the lady is waiting” but he had a letter in his hand i hesitated for a moment before looking to see what mme de stermaria had written who while she held the pen in her hand might have been anything but was now detached from herself an engine of fate pursuing a course alone which she was utterly powerless to alter i asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment although he was cursing the fog as soon as he had gone i opened the envelope on her card inscribed vicomtesse alix de stermaria my guest had written “am so sorry — am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the bois had been so looking forward to it will write you a proper letter from stermaria very sorry kindest regards” i stood motionless stunned by the shock that i had received at my feet lay the card and envelope fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired i picked them up tried to analyse her message “she says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the bois one might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else i shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her but after all that is quite a reasonable interpretation” and from that island in the bois as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with mme de stermâria i could not succeed in bringing them back to where i was my desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end and in spite of this message too recent to counteract that force i went on instinctively getting ready to start just as a student although ploughed by the examiners tries to answer one question more at last i decided to tell françoise to go down and pay the driver i went along the passage without finding her i passed through the diningroom where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which even before i had realised the explanation of it gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement it was the carpets which in view of my parents’ return the servants had begun to put down again those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which obliged as i should be to live to take my meals at home i should no longer be free now to escape when i chose

    “take care you don’t slip sir they’re not tacked yet” françoise called to me “i ought to have lighted up oh dear it’s the end of ‘sectember’ already the fine days are over” in no time winter at the corner of a window as in a galle glass a vein of crusted snow and even in the champselysées instead of the girls one waits to see nothing but solitary sparrows

   what added to my distress at not seeing mme de stermâria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas hour by hour since sunday i had been living for this dinner alone she had presumably never given it a second thought later on i learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time and who had presumably made her forget my invitation for if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which i was not for that matter supposed to be sending for her to inform me that she was otherwise engaged my dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still nonexistent love now my disappointment my rage my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able by bringing my sensibility into play to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had — and that more loosely — offered me

   how many are there in our memories how many more have we forgotten of these faces of girls and young women all different to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us in the case of mme de stermaria there was a good deal more than this and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that i might refresh those impressions so vivid but all too brief which my memory would not without such refreshment have the strength to keep alive when we were apart circumstances decided against me i did not see her again it was not she that i loved but it might well have been and one of the things that made most cruel perhaps the great love which was presently to come to me was that when i thought of this evening i used to say to myself that my love might given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances have been directed elsewhere to mme de stermaria its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore — as i so longed so needed to believe — absolutely necessary and predestined

   françoise had left me by myself in the diningroom with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire she went to get me some dinner for even before the return of my parents from this very evening my seclusion was to begin i caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets still rolled up and leaning against one end of the sideboard and burying my head in it swallowing its dust with my own tears as the jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning i began to sob i shuddered not only because the room was cold but because a distinct lowering of temperature against the danger and — i should add perhaps — the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes drop by drop like a fine penetrating icy rain and seem as though never would they cease to flow suddenly i heard a voice

    “may i come in françoise told me you would be in the diningroom i looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere if it isn’t bad for your throat — there’s a fog outside you could cut with a knife”

   it was — arrived in paris that morning when i imagined him to be still in morocco or on the sea — robert de saintloup

   i have already said as a matter of fact it was robert himself who at balbec had helped me quite without meaning it to arrive at this conclusion what i think about friendship to wit that it is so small a thing that i find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius — nietzsche for instance — can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part yes it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off by a scruple of conscience from wagner’s music imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression naturally vague and inadequate which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one’s leaving one’s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the louvre was burned i had got so far at balbec as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life to which at least it remains alien than friendship the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and save by the channel of art incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds — not like the other any joy in itself but rather a vague sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props hospitably entertained by a strange personality through which happy in the protection that is afforded it there it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself moreover the scorners of friendship can without illusion and not without remorse be the finest friends in the world just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work nevertheless so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish gives his life for a vain cause and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested but whatever might be my opinion of friendship to mention only the pleasure that it procured me of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves

   the thought of course never entered my mind now of asking saintloup to take me as an hour earlier i had been longing to go to see some of the rivebelle women the scar left by my disappointment with mme de stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed but at the moment when i had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness saintloup’s bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness mirth life which were external to me no doubt but offered themselves to me asked only to be made mine he did not himself understand my shout of gratitude my tears of affection and yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends be he diplomat explorer airman or soldier like saintloup who having to start next day for the country from where they will go on heaven knows where seem to form for themselves in the evening which they devote to us an impression which we are astonished both to find so rare and fleeting is it can be so pleasant to them and since it does so delight them not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often a meal with us an event so natural in itself affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an asiatic we set off together to dine and as i went downstairs i thought of doncières where every evening i used to meet robert at his restaurant and the little diningrooms there that i had forgotten i remembered one of these to which i had never given a thought and which was not in the hotel where saintloup dined but in another far humbler a cross between an inn and a boardinghouse where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants i had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm besides robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and i had not cared to go any farther my food was brought to me upstairs in a little room with bare wooden walls the lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles i pretending that i could not see very well as i held out my plate while she helped me to potatoes took her bare forearm in my hand as though to guide her seeing that she did not withdraw it i began to fondle it then without saying a word pulled her bodily to me blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money for the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require to be properly enjoyed not only this servant but the timbered diningroom so remote and lonely and yet it was to the other in which saintloup and his friends dined that i returned every evening from force of habit and in friendship for them until i left doncières but even of this hotel where he took his meals with his friends i had long ceased to think we make little use of our experience we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure but those hours are not altogether wasted when in their turn come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline the others recur bringing with them the groundwork the solid consistency of a rich orchestration they are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy his affection to communicate to us an emotional pleasure very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions we are going to exist solely for him to utter vows of friendship which born within the confines of the hour remaining imprisoned in it will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which i need have no scruple in taking before saintloup since with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths on the morrow he would be gone

   if as i came downstairs i lived over again the evenings at doncières when we reached the street in a moment the darkness now almost total in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps which one could make out glimmering very faintly only when close at hand took me back to i could not say what arrival by night at combray when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt one’s way through a darkness moist warm consecrated like that of a christmas manger just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle between that year — to which i could ascribe no precise date — of my combray life and the evenings at rivebelle which had an hour earlier been reflected above my drawn curtains what a world of differences i felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had i been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which i was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history had the revelation come to me this evening the carriage in which i sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than dr percepied’s on the box seat of which i had composed that little sketch — on which as it happened i had recently laid my hands altered it and sent it in vain to thefigaro — of the spires of martinville is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence day by day but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sunparched heat of some morning or afternoon receives the shadow of some solitary place is enclosed immovable arrested lost remote from all others because therefore the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another wholly different time are of necessity eliminated that if we revive another memory taken from a different year we find between the two thanks to lacunae to vast stretches of oblivion as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes but between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of combray of doncières and of rivebelle i was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time of the distance that there would be between two separate universes the material elements in which were not the same if i had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of rivebelle i should have had to streak with rosy veins to render at once translucent compact refreshing resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of combray but robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage the ideas that had appeared before me took flight ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal at a turning in the road even in his bedroom while he sleeps when they standing framed in the doorway bring him the annunciation of their tidings but as soon as a companion joins him they vanish in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them and i found myself cast back upon friendship when he first appeared robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside but while we were indoors talking it had grown steadily thicker it was no longer merely the light mist which i had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop mme de stermaria and myself a few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night as dark as in the open fields in a forest or rather on a mild breton island whither i would fain have gone i lost myself as on the stark coast of some northern sea where one risks one’s life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight so that we had in finding our way and reaching a safe haven the difficulties the anxiety and finally the joy which safety so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller one thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment “you know i told bloch” saintloup suddenly informed me “that you didn’t really think all that of him that you found him rather vulgar at times i’m like that you see i want people to know where they stand” he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply i was astounded not only had i the most absolute confidence in saintloup in the loyalty of his friendship and he had betrayed it by what he had said to bloch but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so by his defects as well as by his good qualities by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness his triumphant air was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done or did it mean complete unconsciousness stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which i had not associated with him a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable even although i should be compromised by it however that might be his face was seared while he uttered this vulgar speech by a frightful sinuosity which i saw on it once or twice only in all the time i knew him and which beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face when it came to his lips twisted them gave them a hideous expression of baseness almost of bestiality quite transitory and no doubt inherited there must have been at such moments which recurred probably not more than once every other year a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him fully as much as his satisfied air the words “i want people to know where they stand” encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation i felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to one’s own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others but by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant the huge front of which glazed and streaming with light alone succeeded in piercing the darkness the fog itself beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master shot with the most delicate shades of light it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the children of israel many of whom as it happened were to be found inside for this was the place to which bloch and his friends had long been in the habit maddened by a hunger as famishing as the ritual fast which at least occurs only once a year for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity of repairing in the evenings every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others a quality superior to the rest of one’s habits there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life here in their café be it in a little provincial town you will find impassioned musiclovers the greater part of their time all their spare cash is spent in chamberconcerts in meetings for musical discussion in cafés where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra others keen upon flying seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops while another invisible a moment ago comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an arabian roc the little group which met to try to perpetuate to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular café but they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants these looked upon dreyfus and his supporters as traitors albeit twentyfive years later ideas having had time to classify themselves and dreyfusism to acquire in the light of history a certain distinction the sons dancemad bolshevists of these same young nobles were to declare to the ‘intellectuals’ who questioned them that undoubtedly had they been alive at the time they would have stood up for dreyfus without having any clearer idea of what the great case had been about than comtesse edmond de pourtalès or the marquise de galliffet other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth for on the night of the fog the noblemen of the café who were in due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals dreyfusards in retrospect were still bachelors naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off while still potential the only effect of this rich marriage the simultaneous ambition of several of them there were indeed several heiresses in view but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry

   as ill luck would have it saintloup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner i had to make my way in by myself in the first place once i had involved myself in the spinning door to which i was not accustomed i began to fear that i should never succeed in escaping from it let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question despite its peaceful appearance is known as a ‘revolver’ from the english ‘revolving door’ this evening the proprietor not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way the smiling cordiality of his welcome was however dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass this flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula dignus est intrare as a crowning error i went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility from which he at once expelled me indicating to me with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed a place in the other room this was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and i had opposite me the door reserved for the hebrews which as it did not revolve opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught but the proprietor declined to move me saying “no sir i cannot have the whole place upset for you” presently however he forgot this belated and troublesome guest captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who before calling for his beer his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog it was by now long past dinnertime must first as in the old romances pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire

   one reported that his carriage thinking it had got to the pont de la concorde had circled three times round the invalides another that his in trying to make its way down the avenue des champselysées had driven into a clump of trees at the rond point from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear then followed lamentations upon the fog the cold the deathly stillness of the streets uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which except where i sat was warm the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears

   it was all the newcomers could do to keep silence the singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation the proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction “m le prince de foix lost his way three times coming from the porte saintmartin” he was not afraid to say with a laugh actually pointing out as though introducing one to the other the illustrious nobleman to an israelite barrister who on any evening but this would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery “three times — fancy that” said the barrister touching his hat this note of personal interest was not at all to the prince’s liking he formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence even at the expense of their fellownobles when these were not of the very highest rank seemed the sole possible occupation not to acknowledge a bow and if the polite stranger repeated the offence to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one’s head with a look of fury to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them such was the attitude of these young men and especially of the prince de foix such an attitude was encouraged by the illbalanced mentality of early manhood a period in which even in the middle class one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters but it was inspired above all by an overacute caste snobbishness it is true that after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young once youth is outgrown it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence he had supposed it to be the only thing in the world suddenly he discovers for all the prince that he is that there also are such things as music literature even standing for parliament the scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait and whose character is sufficiently formed — if one may so put it — for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty

   as i have mentioned the prince de foix it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four the dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic which the prince lacked i fancy that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect up to their own eyes in debt they were of no account in those of their tradesmen notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as ‘monsieur le comte’ ‘monsieur le marquis’ ‘monsieur le duc’ they hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage ‘moneybags’ as the expression still was and as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel and the secret would be so well kept that when one of them on arriving at the café announced “my dear fellows i am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to mlle d’ambresac” there was a general outburst more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between mlle d’ambresac and himself and not having enough selfcontrol to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage “so you like the idea of marriage do you bibi” the prince de châtellerault could not help exclaiming letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical mlle d’ambresac to be announced but with himself châtellerault as her bridegroom and heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the ambresacs against bibi’s mother “so you think it’ll be fun being married do you” he was impelled to repeat his question to bibi who better prepared to meet it for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semiofficial stage replied with a smile “what pleases me is not the idea of marriage which never appealed much to me but marrying daisy d’ambresac whom i think charming” in the time taken up by this response m de châtellerault had recovered his composure but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of mlle de la canourque or miss foster numbers two and three on the list of heiresses pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that mlle d’ambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for bibi but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her mme soléon he decided to say had actually announced that she would not have them in her house

   but if in the eyes of tradesmen proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account conversely being creatures of dual personality the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them they became once more m le prince this m le duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings a duke who was prac tically a multimillionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because the heads of their various houses they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth often in this café one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him this was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine every time that a man about town enters into relations on this footing with a banker the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another we continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors

   but the prince de foix who was rich already belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included saintloup these were never asked anywhere separately they were known as the four gigolos they were always to be seen riding together in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms with the result that especially as they were all four extremely good looking rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy i was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as saintloup was concerned but the curious thing is that if later on one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three and yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others to gratify a desire or more probably a resentment to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered a fifth for in these groups of four there are never four only had joined this platonic party who was more so than any of the others but religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up and he himself was a married man the father of a family fervently praying at lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers

   despite the prince’s code of manners the fact that the barrister’s comment though uttered in his hearing had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been besides this evening was somewhat exceptional finally the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the prince de foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant the prince felt accordingly that he might allow himself to reply in an arrogant tone as though speaking to some one ‘off stage’ to this stranger who thanks to the fog was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist “losing your way’s nothing the trouble is you can’t find it again” the wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening

   he was in fact in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference this state of mind is by no means to be ignored for applied to political conversations to the reading of newspapers it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history an aggregation of german landlords simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that france england and russia were ‘out to crush’ germany made war at the time of agadir possible even if no war occurred historians if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance

   in politics the proprietor of this particular café had for some time now concentrated his pupilteacher’s mind on certain particular details of the dreyfus case if he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere the prince de foix however impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying “that’s right prince that’s right” which meant neither more nor less than ‘repeated without a mistake’ “that’s exactly how it is” he exclaimed expanding like people in the arabian nights ‘to the limit of repletion’ but the prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room then as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink among them a party of young men from the jockey club who in view of the abnormality of the situation had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room and were thus quite close to me so the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog a familiarity from which i alone was excluded not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in noah’s ark suddenly i saw the landlord’s body whipped into a series of bows the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door “quick send cyprien here lay a table for m le marquis de saintloup” cried the proprietor for whom robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the prince de foix but a client who drove through life fourinhand so to speak and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant the customers in the big room looked on with interest those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes but just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one “good god” he exclaimed “what on earth are you doing there and with the door wide open too” he went on with an angry glance at the proprietor who ran to shut it throwing the blame on his staff “i’m always telling them to keep it shut”

   i had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him “why did you move would you sooner dine here than in the little room why my poor fellow you’re freezing you will oblige me by keeping that door locked” he turned to the proprietor “this very instant m le marquis the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other that is all” and the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out he began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of saintloup while lest i should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal

   something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment i had caught instead of the words “wing of chicken excellent and a glass of champagne only not too dry” the unexpected “i should prefer glycerine yes hot excellent” i wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet i turned quickly back to saintloup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite it was simply a doctor whom i happened to know and of whom another customer taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the café was asking his professional advice like stockbrokers doctors employ the first person singular

   meanwhile i was studying saintloup and my thoughts took a line of their own they were in this café i had myself known at other times plenty of foreigners intellectuals budding geniuses of all sorts resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes their 1830 neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth of an extreme sensibility they repelled — the jews among them principally the unassimilated jews that is to say for with the other kind we are not concerned — those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance as bloch repelled albertine generally speaking one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long noses and eyes that were too big stilted theatrical gestures it was puerile to judge them by these only they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom in the long run one could become closely attached among the jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart a breadth of mind in comparison with which saintloup’s mother and the duc de guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness their skindeep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals their apology for a christianity which led invariably by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind to an enormously wealthy marriage but in saintloup when all was said however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart and whenever it must be frankly admitted to the undying glory of france these qualities are found in a man who is purely french be he noble or plebeian they flower — flourish would be too strong a word for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint — with a grace which the foreign visitor however estimable he may be does not present to us of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious but it is all the same a pleasant thing and one which is perhaps exclusively french that what is fine from the standpoint of equity what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes charmingly coloured consummately chiselled should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection i studied saintloup’s features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the fieldflowers round combray and that the true opus francigenum the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches consists not so much in the stone angels of saintandrédeschamps as in the young sons of france noble citizen or peasant whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch but are creative still as well

   after leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner he laid great stress on our choosing ‘butcher’s meat’ the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of the proprietor came back to inform us that m le prince de foix would esteem it a favour if m le marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours “but they are all taken” objected robert casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine “that doesn’t matter in the least if m le marquis would like it i can easily ask these people to move to another table it is always a pleasure to do anything for m le marquis” “but you must decide” said saintloup to me “foix is a good fellow he may bore you or he may not anyhow he’s not such a fool as most of them” i told robert that of course i should like to meet his friend but that now that i was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy i should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself “he’s got a very fine cloak the prince has” the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation “yes i know” said saintloup i wanted to tell robert that m de charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sisterinlaw and to ask him what could be the reason of this but was prevented by the arrival of m de foix come to see whether his request had been favourably received we caught sight of him standing beside our table robert introduced us but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed the prince withdrew adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which pointed at saintloup seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the prince himself would have liked to see prolonged as he turned to go robert struck it appeared by a sudden idea dashed off after his friend with a “stay where you are and get on with your dinner i shall be back in a moment” to me and vanished into the smaller room i was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me whom i did not know repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young hereditary grand duke of luxembourg formerly comte de nassau whom i had met at balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmother’s illness according to one of these young me he had said to the duchesse de guermantes “i expect everyone to get up when my wife passes” to which the duchess had retorted with as little truth had she said any such thing as humour the grandmother of the young princess having always been the very pink of propriety “get up when your wife passes do they well that’s a change from her grandmother’s day she expected the gentlemen to lie down” then some one alleged that having gone down to see his aunt the princesse de luxembourg at balbec and put up at the grand hotel he had complained to the manager there my friend that the royal standard of luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel over the sea and that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the british or italian it had taken him several days to procure one greatly to the young grand duke’s annoyance i did not believe a word of this story but made up my mind as soon as i went to balbec to inquire of the manager so as to make certain that it was a pure invention while waiting for saintloup to return i asked the proprietor to get me some bread “certainly monsieur le baron” “i am not a baron” i told him “oh beg pardon monsieur le comte” i had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis faithful to his promise of an immediate return saintloup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the prince de foix from whom i guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm he signed to me not to get up and came towards me but either my table would have to be moved again or i must change my seat if he was to get to his entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which apart from myself there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the jockey club friends of his own who had not managed to find places in the other room between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height without the least hesitation saintloup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement i was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in lévitation and in this i was not alone for albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated like racegoers in the enclosure one underling apparently rooted to the ground stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting and when saintloup having to get past his friends climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it balancing himself with his arms discreet applause broke from the body of the room on coming to where i was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign and stooping down handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which a moment later having taken his place beside me without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders

    “by the way while i think of it my uncle charlus has something to say to you i promised i’d send you round to him tomorrow evening”

    “i was just going to speak to you about him but tomorrow evening i am dining with your aunt guermantes”

    “yes there’s a regular beanfeast tomorrow at oriane’s i’m not asked but my uncle palamède doesn’t want you to go there you can’t get out of it i suppose well anyhow go on to my uncle’s afterwards i’m sure he really does want to see you look here you can easily manage to get there by eleven eleven o’clock don’t forget i’ll let him know he’s very touchy if you don’t turn up he’ll never forgive you and oriane’s parties are always over quite early if you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncle’s by eleven i ought really to go and see oriane about getting shifted from morocco i want an exchange she is so nice about all that sort of thing and she can get anything she likes out of general de saintjoseph who runs that branch but don’t say anything about it to her i’ve mentioned it to the princesse de parme everything will be all right interesting place morocco i could tell you all sorts of things very fine lot of men out there one feels they’re on one’s own level mentally”

    “you don’t think the germans are going to go to war about it”

    “no they’re annoyed with us as after all they have every right to be but the emperor is out for peace they are always making us think they want war to force us to give in pure bluff you know like poker the prince of monaco one of wilhelm’s agents comes and tells us in confidence that germany will attack us then we give way but if we didn’t give way there wouldn’t be war in any shape or form you have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days it’d be a bigger catastrophe than the flood and the götterdämmerung rolled in one only it wouldn’t last so long”

   he spoke to me of friendship affection regret albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months which he was to spend in the country and would only be staying a couple of nights in paris on his way back to morocco or elsewhere but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there our infrequent meetings this one in particular have since formed a distinct episode in my memories for him as for me this was the evening of friendship and yet the friendship that i felt for him at this moment was scarcely i feared and felt therefore some remorse at the thought what he would have liked to inspire filled still with the pleasure that i had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal i felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall along the bench had its meaning its cause in saintloup’s own personal nature possibly but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race

   a certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once — like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen — the feeling the motions that were required and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends the place of this constraint being taken in robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which they imagined could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed lastly a noble liberality which taking no account of his boundless natural advantages lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him here as elsewhere the most fashionable customer and the general favourite a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons led him to trample them underfoot just as he had actually and symbolically trodden upon those benches decked with purple like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side such were the qualities essential to aristocracy which through the husk of this body not opaque and vague as mine would have been but significant and limpid transmitted as through a work of art the industrious energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze “alas” robert might have thought “was it worth while to have grown up despising birth honouring only justice and intellect choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and illdressed provided they had the gift of eloquence only for the sole personality apparent in me which is to remain a treasured memory to be not that which my will with the most praiseworthy effort has fashioned in my likeness but one which is not of my making which is not even myself which i have always disliked and striven to overcome was it worth while to love my chosen friend as i have loved him for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself a pleasure which is not in the least as he says though he cannot seriously believe it one of the pleasures of friendship but an intellectual and detached a sort of artistic pleasure” this is what i am now afraid that saintloup may at times have thought if so he was mistaken if he had not as he steadfastly had cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth there would have been something more studied a certain heaviness in his very agility a selfimportant vulgarity in his manners as with mme de villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her memoirs a sense of the frivolous which is intellectual so in order that saintloup’s body might be indwelt by so much nobility the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things and reabsorbed into his body to be fixed there in unconscious noble lines in this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete an artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind it has indeed been said that the highest praise of god consists in the denial of him by the atheist who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator and i was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that i was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course the young prince a descendant of catherine de foix queen of navarre and granddaughter of charles vii whom he had just left for my sake the endowments by birth and fortune which he was laying at my feet the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance the agility the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life by whom i might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart and whom on the contrary he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind with that sovereign liberty of which robert’s movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship

   how much familiar intercourse with a guermantes — in place of the distinction that it had in robert because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment become an unconscious charm of a real moral humility — could disclose of vulgar arrogance i had had an opportunity of seeing not in m de charlus in whom certain characteristic faults for which i had been unable so far to account were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits but in the duc de guermantes and yet he too in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once years earlier at mme de villeparisis’s included glimpses of historic grandeur of which i became conscious when i went to dine in his house on the evening following that which i had spent with saintloup

   they had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the duchess when i had met them first in their aunt’s drawingroom any more than i had discerned on first seeing her the differences that set berma apart from her fellowplayers all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real more conceivable by the intellect and yet however slight the shades of social distinction may be and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like saintebeuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of mme geoffrin mme récamier and mme de boigne they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which unknown to the author emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life with them and for the same reason as with berma when the guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination i was able to distil and analyse it imponderable as it was

   the duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunt’s party i wondered whether in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current he would be present at the dinner but my doubts were speedily set at rest for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinetmaker that is to say with more fellowfeeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due i saw slip towards me m de guermantes himself who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands

    “mme de guermantes will be as pleased as punch” he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone “let me help you off with your duds” he felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people “my wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us although you had fixed a date we’ve been saying to each other all day long ‘depend upon it he’ll never turn up’ i am bound to say mme de guermantes was a better prophet than i was you are not an easy man to get hold of and i was quite sure you were going to play us false” and the duke was so bad a husband so brutal even people said that one felt grateful to him as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart for those words ‘mme de guermantes’ with which he appeared to be spreading out over the duchess a protecting wing that she might be but one flesh with him meanwhile taking me familiarly by the hand he began to lead the way to introduce me into his household just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition shews the trace of some historic event unknown it may be to him who thus alludes to it so this politeness on the part of m de guermantes which moreover he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries’ growth habits of the seventeenth century in particular the people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote we do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling today in a homeric hero or upon a skilful tactical feint in hannibal during the buttle of cannae where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden even in certain personages of the court of louis xiv when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly as existing among these great gentlemen a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship

   this imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers such as macpherson’s ossian we so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought at the most ingenious in a contemporary a translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which signed with a contemporary name and published separately would seem entertaining only at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once this translator was capable only of a mediocre book if that book had been published as his original work given out as a translation it seems that of a masterpiece the past not merely is not fugitive it remains present it is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the placenames the customs of the inhabitants may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the christian era already unintelligible if not actually forgotten at the time of herodotus which in the name given to a rock in a religious rite dwells surrounded by the present like an emanation of greater density immemorial and stable there was similarly an emanation though far less ancient of the life of the court if not in the manners of m de guermantes which were often vulgar at least in the mind that controlled them i was to breathe this again like the odour of antiquity when i joined him a little later in the drawingroom for i did not go there at once

   as we left the outer hall i had mentioned to m de guermantes that i was extremely anxious to see his elstirs “i am at your service is m elstir a friend of yours then if so it is most vexing for i know him slightly he is a pleasant fellow what our fathers used to call an ‘honest fellow’ i might have asked him to honour us with his company and to dine tonight i am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society” very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner the duke relapsed unconsciously into it after inquiring whether i wished him to shew me the pictures he conducted me to them gracefully standing aside for me at each door apologising when to shew me the way he was obliged to precede me a little scene which since the days when saintsimon relates that an ancestor of the guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman must before coming gradually down to us have been enacted by many other guermantes for numberless other visitors and as i had said to the duke that i would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures he discreetly withdrew telling me that i should find him in the drawingroom when i was ready

   only once i was face to face with the elstirs i completely forgot about dinner and the time here again as at balbec i had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter which his speech in no way expressed the parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush all homogeneous with one another were like the luminous images of a magic lantern which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene how often when driving in the dark do we not come upon a long lighted street which begins a few feet away from us when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it which has given us the mirage of depth in view of which is it not logical not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression to represent one thing by that other for which in the flash of a first illusion we mistook it surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision

   the people who detested these ‘horrors’ were astonished to find that elstir admired chardin perroneau any number of painters whom they the ordinary men and women of society liked they did not take into account that elstir had had to make for his own part in striving to reproduce reality with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach the same effort as a chardin or a perroneau and that consequently when he ceased to work for himself he admired in them attempts of the same order fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own nor did these society people include in their conception of elstir’s work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like or at least to look without discomfort at chardin’s painting and yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually as the years bore them away from it the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by ingres and what they had supposed must remain for ever a ‘horror’ manet’solympia for example shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins but we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past

   i was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures more realistic these and in an earlier manner of the same person in one in evening dress in his own drawingroom in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be which proved that for elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend perhaps a patron whom it pleased him just as carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures and in speaking likenesses from contemporary life in venice to introduce into his pictures just as beethoven too found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the archduke rudolph there was something enchanting about this waterside carnival the river the women’s dresses the sails of the boats the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon what delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail in the water of the little harbour in the wooden bridge in the leaves of the trees and in the sky as in one of the pictures that i had seen at balbec the hospital as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself seemed more bold than elstir the theorician then elstir the man of taste the lover of things mediaeval to be intoning “there is no such thing as gothic there is no such thing as a masterpiece this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch” so i now heard “the slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him — her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat and there are no degrees of value and beauty the commonplace dress and the sail beautiful in itself are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam the value is all in the painter’s eye” this eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze but just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression one felt that the lady would presently move out of it the boats drift away the night draw on that pleasure comes to an end that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence at once of so many lights do not recur i recognized yet another aspect quite different it is true of what the moment means in a series of watercolours of mythological subjects dating from elstir’s first period which also adorned this room society people who held ‘advanced’ views on art went ‘as far as’ this earliest manner but no further these were certainly not the best work that he had done but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness thus the muses for instance were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening in twos or threes along some mountain path here and there a poet of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist characterised by a certain sexlessness strolled with a muse as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together in one of these watercolours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains whom a centaur meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness had taken on his back and was carrying home in more than one other the vast landscape in which the mythical scene the fabulous heroes occupied a minute place and were almost lost was rendered from the mountain tops to the sea with an exactitude which told one more than the hour told one to the very minute what time of day ft was thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows in this way the artist managed to give by making it instantaneous a sort of historical reality as of a thing actually lived to the symbol of his fable painted it and set it at a definite point in the past

   while i was examining elstir’s paintings the bell rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness but the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded — less rapidly it is true — in awakening me from my dream as the silence that follows lindor’s music arouses bartolo from his sleep i was afraid that i had been forgotten that they had sat down to dinner and hurried to the drawingroom at the door of the elstir gallery i found a servant waiting for me whitehaired though whether with age or powder i cannot say with the air of a spanish minister but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a king i felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour and i thought with alarm of the delay i had caused in the service of dinner especially as i had promised to be at m de charlus’s by eleven

   the spanish minister though i also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter who radiant with delight when i inquired after his girl told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her and extolled the generosity of madame la duchesse conducted me to the drawingroom where i was afraid of finding m de guermantes in an ill humour he welcomed me on the contrary with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness but was also sincere prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests who completely filled the room indeed i heard afterwards that i had kept them waiting for nearly threequarters of an hour the duc de guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the diningroom this politeness would be more complete if by not having dinner announced immediately he could succeed in persuading me that i was not late and that they had not been waiting for me and so he asked me as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived what i thought of his elstirs but at the same time and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent so as not to lose another moment he in concert with the duchess proceeded to the ceremony of introduction then only i perceived that there had occurred round about me me who until this evening save for my novitiate in mme swann’s drawingroom had been accustomed in my mother’s homes at combray and in paris to the manners either protecting or defensive of the grim ladies of our middleworld who treated me as a child a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces parsifal suddenly into the midst of the flowermaidens those who surrounded me now their bosoms entirely bare the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long caressing glances as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint many not all for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt the caprices of one’s conduct denied by saintlier friends in the face of the evidence seemed in the guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain one pretended not to know that the body of one’s hostess was at the disposal of all comers provided that her visiting list showed no gaps as the duke put himself out not at all for his other guests of whom he had long known everything that there was to know and they of him but quite markedly for me whose kind of superiority being outside his experience inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of louis xiv used to feel for his plebeian ministers he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all — to me at least though it might to them — and while i was anxious on his account as to the impression that i was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me

   at the very outset i found myself completely bewildered no sooner had i entered the drawingroom than m de guermantes without even allowing me time to shake hands with the duchess had led me as though i were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying “here’s your friend you see i’m bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck” towards a lady of smallish stature whereupon long before thrust forward by the duke i had reached her chair the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large soft dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us as this was precisely my case and i could not succeed in calling to mind who she was i averted my eyes from her as i approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself she looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say “oh but this is a pleasure mamma will be pleased when i tell her i’ve met you” i was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that i did finally greet her fully aware of what i was doing so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely like the note of a tuningfork might at length be let go but m de guermantes managed things so badly to my mind at least that i seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy which baffled me completely seem to her indeed as soon as i had come within reach she did not offer me her hand but took mine in a familiar clasp and spoke to me exactly as though i had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted she told me how sorry albert who i gathered was her son would be to have missed seeing me i tried to remember who among the people i had known as boys was called albert and could think only of bloch but this could not be bloch’s mother that i saw before me since she had been dead for some time in vain i struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back but i could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass even when the sun is blazing on it she asked me whether my father was not working too hard if i would not come to the theatre some evening with albert if i was stronger now and as my replies stumbling through the mental darkness in which i was plunged became distinct only to explain that i was not feeling well that evening she pushed forward a chair for me herself going to all sorts of trouble which i was not accustomed to see taken by my parents’ friends at length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the duke “she thinks you’re charming” he murmured in my ear which felt somehow that it had heard these words before they were what mme de villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the princesse de luxembourg everything became clear the lady i now saw had nothing in common with mme de luxembourg but from the language of him who thus served me with her i could discern the nature of the animal it was a royalty she had never before heard of either my family or myself but a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world for a daughter of the prince de parme she had married a cousin of equal princelihood she sought always in gratitude to her creator to testify to her neighbour however poor or lowly he might be that she did not look down upon him really i might have guessed this from her smile i had seen the princesse de luxembourg buy little ryecakes on the beach at balbec to give to my grandmother as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden but this was only the second princess of the blood royal to whom i had been presented and i might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great besides had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness since the duchesse de guermantes who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the opéracomique had appeared furious when i bowed to her in the street like people who having once given somebody a sovereign feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him as for m de charlus his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted while in the sequel i have known as the reader will learn highnesses and majesties of another sort altogether queens who play the queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the queens in sardou’s plays

   if m de guermantes had been in such haste to present me it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a royal personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant it was similar to the haste which saintloup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother by the same token by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial in which rather by a centripetal reversion it is the surface that becomes essential and profound the due and duchesse de guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those which one at least of the pair neglected often enough of charity chastity pity and justice as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the princesse de parme save in the third person

   having never yet in my life been to parma a pilgrimage i had been anxious to make ever since certain easter holidays long ago to meet its princess who i knew owned the finest palace in that matchless city where moreover everything must be in keeping isolated as it was from the rest of the world within the polished walls in the atmosphere stifling as a breathless summer evening on the piazza of a small town in italy of its compact and almost cloying name would surely have substituted in a flash for what i had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at parma in a sort of partial arrival there without my having to stir from paris of myself it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of correggio a simple equation so to speak of that unknown quantity but if i had for many years past — like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent — made this name princesse de parme absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets in return when i set eyes on the princess who until then i should have sworn must be the sanseverina herself a second process began which was not i may say completed until several months had passed and consisted in expelling by means of fresh chemical combinations all the essential oil of violets and all the stendhalian fragrance from the name of the princess and in implanting there in their place the image of a little dark woman taken up with good works of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots moreover while barring a few points of difference she was exactly like any other great lady she was as little stendhalian as is for example in paris in the europe quarter the rue de parme which bears far less resemblance to the name of parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets and reminds one not nearly so much of the charterhouse in which fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the saintlazare station

   her friendliness sprang from two causes the first and more general was the education which this daughter of kings had received her mother not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of europe but furthermore — in contrast to the ducal house of parma — richer than any reigning princess had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery and today every line of the daughter’s face the curve of her shoulders the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson “remember that if god has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom divine providence has willed wherefore his name be praised that you should be superior by birth and fortune on the contrary you must suffer the little ones your ancestors were princes of treves and juliers from the year 647 god has decreed in his bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the suez canal and three times as many royal dutch as edmond de rothschild your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year 63 of the christian era you have as sistersinlaw two empresses therefore never seem in your speech to be recalling these great privileges not that they are precarious for nothing can alter antiquity of race while the world will always need petrol but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all giltedged since everyone knows these facts already be helpful to the needy furnish to all those whom the bounty of heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank that is to say help in the form of money even your personal service by their sickbeds but never bear well in mind invite them to your parties which would do them no possible good and by weakening your own position would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities”

   and so even at the moments when she could not do good the princess endeavoured to shew or rather to let it be thought by all the external signs of dumb language that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown she treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which wellbred people treat their inferiors and was continually to make herself useful pushing back her chair so as to leave more room holding my gloves offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or instinctively and by force of professional habit by retired servants

   but already the duke who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction had led me off to another of the flowermaidens on hearing her name i told her that i had passed by her country house not far from balbec “oh i should have been so pleased to take you over it” she informed me almost in a whisper to enhance her modesty but in a tone of deep feeling steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure and went on with a meaning glance “i do hope you will come again some day but i must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt brancas’s place it was built by mansard it is the jewel of the province” it was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house but her aunt brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers or so i was assured by this lady who thought evidently that especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality by speeches which involved them in nothing it was also because she sought like everyone in her world to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing to give him the highest idea of himself to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them that he honoured those who entertained him that everyone was burning to know him the desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does it must be admitted exist even among the middle classes we find there that kindly disposition in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions but there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches in an important section of the aristocracy on the other hand this characteristic has ceased to be individual cultivated by education sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation which knows no rival is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so it has become the generic feature of a class and even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation

    “she is a very good creature” said the duc de guermantes of the princesse de parme “and she can play the ‘great lady’ when she likes better than anyone”

   while i was being introduced to the ladies one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation this was comte hannibal de bréautéconsalvi arriving late he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party and when i entered the room seeing in me a guest who was not one of the duchess’s regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man i was he knew that mme de guermantes possessed the priceless appanage of truly superior women what was called a ‘salon’ that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece the faubourg saintgermain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that to the reception which she had given to meet the king and queen of england the duchess had not been afraid to invite m détaille the clever women of the faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius mme de courvoisier made out that m ribot had been there as well but this was a pure invention designed to make people believe that oriane was aiming at an embassy for her husband finally a last straw of scandal m de guermantes with a gallantry that would have done credit to marshal saxe had repaired to the greenroom of the comédie française and had begged mlle reichemberg to come and recite before the king which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs remembering all these surprises which moreover had his entire approval his own presence being not merely an ornament but in the same way as that of the duchesse de guermantes a consecration to any drawingroom m de bréauté when he asked himself who i could be felt that the field of exploration was very wide for a moment the name of m widor flashed before his mind but he decided that i was not old enough to be an organist and m widor not striking enough to be ‘asked out’ it seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new attaché at the swedish legation of whom he had heard and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of oscar by whom he had several times been very hospitably received but when the duke in introducing me had mentioned my name to m de bréauté the latter finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that being where i was i must be a celebrity of some sort oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent otherwise she would have lowered its tone m de bréauté began therefore to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count but by the character of the party which my presence could not fail to make interesting and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the duc de chartres’s luncheontable he had not yet settled in his own mind whether i was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer or the author of the new ‘curtainraiser’ then in rehearsal at the théâtre français but a great intellectual a great collector of ‘travellers’ tales’ he continued an ever increasing display of reverences signs of mutual understanding smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him the comte de bréautéconsalvi the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me just as if in fact he had found himself face to face with one of the ‘natives’ of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded natives from whom in the hope of ultimate profit he would endeavour observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship or like them uttering loud cries to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads having responded as best i could to his joy i shook hands next with the duc de chatellerault whom i had already met at mme de villeparisis’s who he informed me was as ‘cunning as they made ’em’ he was typically guermantes in the fairness of his hair his arched profile the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but as i was no longer in love with the duchess her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction i interpreted the hook made by the duc de chatellerault’s nose as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work i had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least next i said good evening also to the prince de foix and to the detriment of my knuckles which emerged crushed and mangled let them be caught in a vice which was the german handclasp accompanied by an ironical or goodnatured smile of the prince von faffenheim m de norpois’s friend who by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set was known so universally as prince von that he himself used to sign his letters ‘prince von’ or when he wrote to his intimates ‘von’ and yet this abbreviation was understandable in view of his triplebarrelled name it was less easy to grasp the reasons which made ‘elizabeth’ be replaced now by ‘lili’ now by ‘bebeth’ just as another world swarmed with ‘kikis’ one can realise that these people albeit in most respects idle and lightminded enough might have come to adopt ‘quiou’ in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce ‘montesquieu’ but it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins ‘dinand’ instead of ‘ferdinand’ it must not be thought however that in the invention of nicknames the guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables thus two sisters the comtesse de montpeyroux and the vicomtesse de vélude who were both of them enormously stout invariably heard themselves addressed without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other people’s so long established was the custom as ‘petite’ and ‘mignonne’ mme de guermantes who adored mme de montpeyroux would if her friend had been seriously ill have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed “i hear petite is dreadfully bad” mme de l’eclin who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears was never called anything but ‘the empty stomach’ in some cases people simply added an ‘a’ to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife the most miserly most sordid most inhuman man in the faubourg having been christened raphael his charmer his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself ‘raphaela’— but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules to which we can always return later on if the occasion offers and explain some of them i then asked the duke to present me to the prince d’agrigente “what do you mean to say you don’t know our excellent grigri” cried m de guermantes and gave m d’agrigente my name his own so often quoted by françoise had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which i beheld struck on the shore of the violet sea by the slanting rays of a golden sun the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which i had not the least doubt that the prince — happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through paris — was himself as luminously sicilian and gloriously mellowed the absolute sovereign alas the vulgar drone to whom i was introduced and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty without perhaps ever having stopped to examine it the prince d’agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely anything that might make one think of girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name entirely distinct from himself bound by no ties to his person had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other and isolating it after the operation in the enchanted syllables if any such operation had been performed it had certainly been done most efficiently for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of guermantes with the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was prince d’agrigente and the man who of all the men in the world was perhaps least so he was for all that very glad to be what he was but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of ivanhoe or primrose or is called merely the premier meanwhile as these introductions which it has taken me so long to recount but which beginning as i entered the room had lasted only a few seconds were coming to an end and mme de guermantes in an almost suppliant tone was saying to me “i am sure basin is tiring you dragging you round like that we are anxious for you to know our friends but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you so that you may come again often” the duke with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand gave as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour filled for me by the contemplation of his elstirs the signal that dinner might now be served

   i should add that one of the guests was still missing m de grouchy whose wife a guermantes by birth had arrived by herself her husband being due to come straight from the country where he had been shooting all day this m de grouchy a descendant of his namesake of the first empire of whom it has been said quite wrongly that his absence at the start of the battle of waterloo was the principal cause of napoleon’s defeat came of an excellent family which however was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood thus the prince de guermantes whose own tastes in later life were to prove more easily satisfied had been in the habit of saying to his nieces “what a misfortune for that poor mme de guermantes” the vicomtesse de guermantes mme de grouchy’s mother “that she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children” “but uncle the eldest girl married m de grouchy” “i do not call that a husband however they say that your uncle françois has proposed for the youngest one so perhaps they won’t all die old maids” no sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr multiple and simultaneous the double doors of the diningroom swung apart a chamberlain with the air of a lord chamberlain bowed before the princesse de parme and announced the tidings “madame is served” in a tone such as he would have employed to say “madame is dead” which however cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as in summer at ‘robinson’ that the couples moved forward one behind another to the diningroom separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them last of all mme de guermantes advanced upon me that i might lead her to the table and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that i might have feared for like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing observing no doubt that i had placed myself on the wrong side of her she pivoted with such accuracy round me that i found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements i yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup as though the dinner were being held in a puppettheatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set on a signal from the puppetmaster all the machinery in motion

   timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the duke to which had responded the unlocking of that vast ingenious subservient and sumptuous clockwork mechanical and human the indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it for i could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time just as mme de guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures i would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions so that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur as also did that indifference shewn by the duke to the splendour of his surroundings in contrast to his deference towards a guest however insignificant whom he desired to honour

   not that m de guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money the arrogance of an upstart which he certainly was not but just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it by those forces on which they can rely the government of france and the catholic church so m de guermantes was borne on by that other force aristocratic courtesy in its truest form this courtesy drew the line at any number of people mme de guermantes would not have asked to her house mme de cambremer or m de forcheville but the moment that anyone as was the case with me appeared eligible for admission into the guermantes world this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still were that possible than those historic rooms or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them

   when he wished to give pleasure to anyone m de guermantes possessed in this way for making his guest for the moment the principal person present an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place no doubt at guermantes his ‘distinctions’ and ‘favours’ would have assumed another form he would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive alone with himself before dinner such as they were one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of louis xiv when he replies goodnaturedly smiling and almost with a bow to some one who has come to solicit his favour it must however in both instances be borne in mind that this ‘politeness’ did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word

   louis xiv with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault nevertheless for his scant regard for etiquette so much so that according to saintsimon he was only a very minor king as kings go when compared with such monarchs as philippe de valois or charles v has the most minute instructions drawn up so that princes of the blood and ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence in certain cases in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of louis xiv monseigneur shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors in the open air so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other and the elector palatine entertaining the duc de chevreuse at dinner pretends so as not to have to make way for his guest to be taken ill and dines with him indeed but dines lying down thus avoiding the difficulty m le duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to monsieur the latter on the advice of the king his brother who is moreover extremely attached to him seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt but as soon as the feeling is deep when the heart is involved this rule of duty so inflexible when politeness only is at stake changes entirely a few hours after the death of his brother one of the people whom he most dearly loved when monsieur in the words of the duc de montfort is ‘still warm’ we find louis xiv singing snatches from operas astonished that the duchesse de bourgogne who has difficulty in concealing her grief should be looking so woebegone and desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables ordering the duc de bourgogne to start a game of brelan well not only in his social and concentrated activities but in the most spontaneous utterances the ordinary preoccupations of m de guermantes the use he made of his time one found a similar contrast the guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded as the traveller discovers almost unaltered the houses roofed with turf the terraces which may have met the eyes of xenophon or saint paul so in the manners of m de guermantes a man who melted one’s heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness i found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under louis xiv which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions

   the other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the princesse de parme was of a more personal kind it was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the duchesse de guermantes’s people and things alike was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home it is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case over the simplest dish the most ordinary flowers she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies she would ask leave to send round next morning to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom her head cook or head gardener gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine had not such ornamental streaks did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home but if in the princess wherever she went this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her creator it was on the other hand in all sincerity that she regarded the drawingroom of the duchesse de guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight to a certain extent for that matter though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind the guermantes were different from the rest of noble society they were rarer and more refined they had given me at first sight the opposite impression i had found them vulgar similar to all other men and women but because before meeting them i had seen in them as in balbec in florence in parma only names evidently in this drawingroom all the women whom i had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women but in the same way as balbec or florence the guermantes after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellowcreatures rather than their name could subsequently though to a less degree appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics their bodily structure the colour — a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet — of their skins a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair even in the men on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts half a wallgrowing lichen half a catlike fur a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect for if people spoke of the guermantes complexion the guermantes hair they spoke also of the wit of the guermantes as of the wit of the mortemarts — a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of louis xiv and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves all this meant that in the material itself precious as that might be in which one found them embedded here and there the guermantes remained recognisable easy to detect and to follow like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx or better still like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a mossagate

   the guermantes — those at least who were worthy of the name — were not only of a quality of flesh of hair of transparency of gaze that was exquisite but had a way of holding themselves of walking of bowing of looking at one before they shook one’s hand of shaking hands which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock and despite their friendliness one asked oneself “have they not indeed the right though they waive it when they see us walk bow leave a room do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem to think ‘these people are of another race than ours and we are we the true lords of creation’” later on i realised that the guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race but one that aroused their envy because i possessed merits of which i knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important later still i came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy the physical flexibility essential to the guermantes was twofold thanks to one of its forms constantly in action at any moment and if for example a male guermantes were about to salute a lady he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because having been broken so often in the huntingfield it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise while the monocle settled itself before his eye raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow the other flexibility like the form of the wave the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the shell or the vessel was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility curving the arched nose which beneath the blue protruding eyes above the overthin lips from which in the women there emerged a raucous voice recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and hellenising genealogists to his race ancient beyond dispute but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine bird

   the guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view with the exception of prince gilbert the husband with antiquated ideas of ‘mariegilbert’ who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood though royal was inferior to his own— but he was an exception and furnished behind his back a perpetual laughingstock to the rest of the family who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him — the guermantes while living in the pure cream of aristocracy affected to take no account of nobility the theories of the duchesse de guermantes who to tell the truth by dint of being a guermantes became to a certain extent something different and more attractive subordinated everything else so completely to intellect and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living and which always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall at another in the drawingroom at a third in her dressingroom reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as mme la duchesse reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sisterinlaw when eight o’clock struck and to put on a low gown

   the same familiar spirit represented to mme de guermantes the social duties of duchesses of the foremost among them that was who like herself were multimillionaires the sacrifice to boring tea dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books as unpleasant necessities like rain which mme de guermantes accepted letting play on them her biting humour but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them the curious accident by which the butler of mme de guermantes invariably said “madame la duchesse” to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as ‘madame’ giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that thinking of something else at the time she had heard only the word ‘madame’ and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention only though she might feign deafness she was not dumb in fact whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler “remind monsieur le duc —”

   the familiar spirit had other occupations as well one of which was to inspire them to talk morality it is true that there were guermantes who went in for intellect and guermantes who went in for morals and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide but the former kind — including a guermantes who had forged cheques who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all with a mind open to every new and sound idea — spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others and in the same strain as mme de villeparisis at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady at corresponding moments one saw the guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as oldladylike as genial and as they themselves had more charm more touching than that of the marquise to say of a servant “one feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature she’s not at all a common girl she must come of decent parents she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray” at such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation but at times it could be bearing also the expression on a face the same in the duchess as in her grandfather the marshal a sort of undefinable convulsion like that of the serpent the genius of the carthaginian family of barca by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing on my morning walks when before i had recognised mme de guermantes i felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy this familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the guermantes but to the courvoisiers the rival faction of the family and though of as good blood as the guermantes it was indeed through his courvoisier grandmother that the guermantes explained the obsession which led the prince de guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered their opposite in every respect not only did the courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the guermantes they had not the same idea of it for a guermantes even were he a fool to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue to be capable of saying cutting things to ‘get away with it’ but it meant also the capacity to hold one’s own equally in painting music architecture to speak english the courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to ‘having probably murdered one’s father and mother’ for them intelligence was the sort of burglar’s jemmy by means of which people one did not know from adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawingrooms and it was common knowledge among the courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having ‘those sort’ of people in your house to the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not ‘in society’ the courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust some one having on one occasion remarked “but swann is younger than palamède”—“he says so at any rate and if he says it you may be sure it’s because he thinks it is to his interest” had been mme de gallardon’s retort better still when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder “but is she really the elder” mme de gallardon had inquired not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status of definite traditions they were both more or less young like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide the courvoisiers more than the guermantes maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts just as the guermantes for whom below the royal families and a few others like the lignes the la trémoïlles and so forth all the rest were lost in a common rubbishheap were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round guermantes simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the courvoisiers were enormously impressed so the absence of such distinctions affected them little certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but brilliantly married rich goodlooking beloved of duchesses were for paris where people are never very well up in who one’s ‘father and mother’ were an excellent and exclusive piece of ‘imported goods’ it might happen though not commonly that such women were through the channel of the princesse de parme or by virtue of their own attractions received by certain guermantes but with regard to these the indignation of the courvoisiers knew no bounds having to meet between five and six in the afternoon at their cousin’s people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the perche became for them an everincreasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric the moment for instance when the charming comtesse g——entered the guermantes drawingroom the face of mme de villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line

   and should but one stand fast that one were surely i

   a line which for that matter was unknown to her this courvoisier had consumed almost every monday an éclair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the comtesse g— — but to no consequence and mme de villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the secondbest society of châteaudun “i really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows it’s making a perfect farce of society” concluded mme de villebon with a change of facial expression this time a sly smile of despair which in a charade would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first

   grâce aux dieux mon malheur passe mon espérance

   we may here anticipate events to explain that the persévérance which rhymes in the following line with espérance shewn by mme de villebon in snubbing mme g——was not entirely wasted in the eyes of mme g——— it invested mme de villebon with a distinction so supreme though purely imaginary that when the time came for mme g——‘s daughter who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season to marry people were astonished to see her refuse all the dukes in succession the fact was that her mother remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the rue de grenelle on account of chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter — a villebon son

   a single point at which guermantes and courvoisiers converged was the art one for that matter of infinite variety of marking distances the guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone and yet to take an example all the guermantes all those who really were guermantes when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood at the moment when a guermantes were he no more than twenty but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say “how d’ye do” a gaze generally blue always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart which was a matter of fact what the guermantes imagined themselves to be doing each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order they thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts all this occurred at a distance from yourself which little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms seemed immense for a handclasp and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other so that when the guermantes after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter his hand directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting certain guermantes lacking the sense of proportion or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the ‘familiar spirit’ had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess the courvoisiers whose physique was different had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference on the other hand it was from the courvoisiers that certain very exceptional guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting at the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you almost to an angle of fortyfive degrees her head and bust the rest of her body which came very high up to the belt which formed a pivot remaining stationary but no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle this subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest as in a duel the original positions were retained this same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance which was courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint displayed itself equally clearly in the courvoisier ladies as in the guermantes in the letters which you received from them at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance the ‘body’ of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only you would suppose to a friend but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady since the letter began with ‘monsieur’ and ended with ‘croyez monsieur à mes sentiments distingués’ after which between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest there might come in succession were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself the most touching pictures of the grief which the guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister of the intimacy that had existed between them of the beauty of the place in which she was staying of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections the intimate character of which implied however no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the younger pliny or mme de simiane

   it is true that certain guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as ‘my dear friend’ or ‘my friends’ these were not always the most simple natured among them but rather those who living only in the society of kings and being at the same time ‘light’ assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer however since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of louis xiii was enough to make a young guermantes say in speaking of the marquise de guermantes “my aunt adam” the guermantes were so numerous a clan that even among these simple rites that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger there existed a wide divergence each subsection of any refinement had its own which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam thus it was that we saw saintloup’s handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one’s name without any participation by his eyes without the addition of a bow any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason — which for that matter very rarely occurred — was presented to anyone of the saintloup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting which deliberately assumed the appearance of nonrecognition to discover what in the world the guermantes — male or female — could have against him and he was highly surprised to learn that the said guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger • whom he or she looked forward to meeting again as specialised as the mechanical gestures of saintloup were the complicated and rapid capers which m de charlus condemned as ridiculous of the marquis de fierbois the grave and measured paces of the prince de guermantes but it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast

   to return to the antipathy which animated the courvoisiers against the duchesse de guermantes they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried for she was then comparatively poor unfortunately at all times and seasons a sort of fuliginous emanation quite sut generis enveloped hid from the eye the wealth of the courvoisiers which however great it might be remained obscure in vain might a young courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in paris ‘came up to stay’ in the season with his parents and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished whereas a saintloup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled doncières with his carriagehorses a courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram similarly though of course many years earlier mlle de guermantes oriane who had scarcely a penny to her name created more stir with her clothes than all the courvoisiers put together the really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair she had had the audacity to say to the russian grand duke “well sir i hear you would like to have tolstoy murdered” at a dinnerparty to which none of the courvoisiers not that any of them knew very much about tolstoy had been asked they knew little more about greek writers if we may judge by the dowager duchesse de gallardon motherinlaw of the princesse de gallardon who at that time was still a girl who not having been honoured by oriane with a single visit in five years replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention “it seems she recites aristotle” meaning aristophanes “in society i cannot allow that sort of thing in my house”

   one can imagine how greatly this ‘sally’ by mlle de guermantes upon tolstoy if it enraged the courvoisiers delighted the guermantes and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them the dowager comtesse d’argencourt née seineport who entertained a little of everything because she was a bluestocking and in spite of her son’s being a terrible snob repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment “oriane de guermantes you know she’s as fine as amber as mischievous as a monkey there’s nothing she couldn’t do if she chose her watercolours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better verses than most of the great poets and as for family don’t you know you couldn’t imagine anything better her grandmother was mlle de montpensier and she is the eighteenth oriane de guermantes in succession without a single misalliance it’s the purest blood the oldest in the whole of france” and so the sham men of letters those demiintellectuals who went to mme d’argencourt’s forming a mental picture of oriane de guermantes whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than princess badroulbadour not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified tolstoy above all others but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of tolstoy their longing to fight against tsarism these liberal ideas might have grown faint in them they might have begun to doubt their importance no longer venturing to confess to holding them when suddenly from mlle de guermantes herself that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak who wore her hair flat on her brow a thing that no courvoisier would ever have consented to do came this vehement support a certain number of realities good or bad in themselves gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us for instance among the courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day with the result that everyone else suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics but the guermantes in general and oriane in particular while better conversant than anyone with these rites did not hesitate if they caught sight of you from a carriage to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand and in a drawingroom leaving the courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows sketched charming reverences in the air held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes so that suddenly thanks to the guermantes there entered into the substance of smartness until then a little hollow and dry everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego a genuine welcome the effusion of a true friendliness spontaneity it is in a similar fashion but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies however commonplace which have in them something easy and caressing succeed by dint of education in symphonic culture in mortifying that appetite but once they have arrived at this point when dazzled — and rightly so — by the brilliant orchestral colouring of richard strauss they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of auber the most vulgar motifs what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude when they listen to salomé by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in les diamants de la couronne authentic or not the retort made by mlle de guermantes to the grand duke retailed from house to house furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which oriane had been turned out at the dinnerparty in question but if such splendour and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the courvoisiers springs not from wealth but from prodigality the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former which allows it to spend all its fire given the principles openly advertised not only by oriane but by mlle de villeparisis namely that nobility does not count that it is ridiculous to bother one’s head about rank that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness that intellect heart talent are alone of importance the courvoisiers were justified in hoping that as a result of the training she had received from the marquise oriane would marry some one who was not in society an artist a fugitive from justice a scallawag a freethinker that she would pass definitely into the category of what the courvoisiers called ‘detrimentals’ they were all the more justified in this hope since inasmuch as mme de villeparisis was at this very moment from the social point of view passing through an awkward crisis none of the few bright stars whom i was to meet in her drawingroom had as yet reappeared there she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof even when she referred to her nephew the prince de guermantes whom she did still see she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree but the moment it became a question of finding a husband for oriane it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations it had been the mysterious ‘familiar spirit’ of their race as unerringly as if mme de villeparisis and oriane had never spoken of anything but rentrolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character and as if the marquise for the space of a few days had been — as she would ultimately be — dead and on her bier in the church of combray where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere guermantes with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single ‘g’ in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born on the most eligible bachelor of the faubourg saintgermain on the eldest son of the duc de guermantes the prince des laumes that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual the critical the evangelical mme de villeparisis and for a couple of hours on the day of the wedding mme de villeparisis received in her drawingroom all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the prince des laumes promptly left cards preparatory to ‘cutting the cable’ in the following year and then making the courvoisiers’ cup of bit terness overflow the same old maxims which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social preeminence resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the princesse des laumes immediately after her mar riage and in this respect be it said in passing the point of view which saintloup upheld when he lived with rachel frequented the friends of rachel would have liked to marry rachel implied — whatever the horror that it inspired in the family — less falsehood than that of the guermantes young ladies in general preaching the virtues of intellect barely admitting the possibility of anyone’s questioning the equality of mankind all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke saintloup did on the contrary act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways certainly from the moral standpoint rachel was not altogether satisfactory but it is by no means certain whether if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions mme de marsantes would not have been in favour of the match

   well to return to mme des laumes shortly afterwards duchesse de guermantes on the death of her fatherinlaw it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the courvoisiers that the theories of the young princess remaining thus lodged in her speech should not in any sense be guiding her conduct with the result that this philosophy if one may so call it in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the guermantes drawingroom no doubt all the people whom mme de guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough and some rich american lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy never opened of parny’s poems arranged because it was of the ‘period’ upon one of the tables in her inner room shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the duchesse de guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the opera no doubt also mme de guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect when she said of a woman “it appears she’s quite charming” or of a man that he was the “cleverest person in the world” she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment more deeply rooted stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the guermantes exercised their judgment this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value actual or potential the man was pronounced learned but like a dictionary or on the contrary common with the mind of a commercial traveller the woman pretty but with a terribly bad style or too talkative as for the people who had no definite position they were simply dreadful — such snobs m de bréauté whose country house was quite close to guermantes mixed with no one below the rank of highness but he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums accordingly mme de guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of m de bréauté as a snob “a snob babal but my poor friend you must be mad it’s just the opposite he loathes smart people he won’t let himself be introduced to anyone even in my house if i ask him to meet some one he doesn’t know he swears at me all the time” this was not to say that even in practice the guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the courvoisiers in a positive sense this difference between the guermantes and the courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit thus the duchesse de guermantes enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance had given that party to which i have already referred at which the king of england had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else for she had had the idea which would never have occurred to a courvoisier mind of inviting and the audacity from which a courvoisier courage would have recoiled to invite apart from the personages already mentioned the musician gaston lemaire and the dramatist grandmougin but it was preeminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt if the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the princesse des laumes became more exalted vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal crowned heads of europe conversely the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose for instance at the princesse de parme’s parties there were a number of people whom her royal highness invited because she had known them as children or because they were related to some duchess or attached to the person of some sovereign they themselves being quite possibly ugly boring or stupid well with a courvoisier any of the reasons “a favourite of the princesse de parme” “a niece on the mother’s side of the duchesse d’arpajon” “spends three months every year with the queen of spain” would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house but mme de guermantes who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the princesse de parme’s had never once allowed them to cross her threshold considering that the same rule applied to a drawingroom in a social as in a material sense where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owner’s wealth to render it hideous such a drawingroom resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning brilliance fluency like a book like a house the quality of a ‘salon’ thought mme de guermantes — and rightly — is based on the cornerstone of sacrifice

   many of the friends of the princesse de parme with whom the duchesse de guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting or to returning their cards without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs complained discreetly of these omissions to her highness who on days when m de guermantes came by himself to see her passed on a hint to him but the wily nobleman a bad husband to the duchess in so far as he kept mistresses but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawingroom and her own wit which formed its chief attraction replied “but doe my wife know her indeed oh well i daresay she does but the truth is ma’am that oriane does not care for women’s conversation she lives surrounded by a court of superior minds — i am not her husband i am only the first footman except for quite a small number who are all of them very clever indeed women bore her surely ma’am your highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the marquise de souvré has any brains yes i quite understand the princess receives her out of kindness besides your highness knows her you tell me that oriane has met her it is quite possible but once or twice at the most i assure you and then i must explain to your highness it is really a little my fault as well my wife is very easily tired and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if i allowed her she would never stop going to see people only yesterday evening she had a temperature she was afraid of hurting the duchesse de bourbon’s feelings by not going to see her i had to shew my teeth i assure you i positively forbade them to bring the carriage round do you know ma’am i should really prefer not to mention to oriane that you have spoken to me about mme de souvré my wife is so devoted to your highness she will go round at once to invite mme de souvré to the house that will mean another call to be paid it will oblige us to make friends with the sister whose husband i know quite well i think i shall say nothing at all about it to oriane if the princess has no objection that will save her a great deal of strain and excitement and i assure you that it will be no loss to mme de souvré she goes everywhere moves in the most brilliant circles you know we don’t entertain at all really just a few little friendly dinners mme de souvré would be bored to death” the princesse de parme innocently convinced that the duc de guermantes would not transmit her request to his duchess and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that mme de souvré sought was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household no doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also thus whenever the princesse de parme invited mme de guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the duchess and make her refuse to come again

   on ordinary evenings after dinner at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour for she clung to old customs a small party the drawingroom of the princesse de parme was thrown open to her regular guests and generally speaking to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy french and foreign the order of her receptions was as follows on issuing from the diningroom the princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her or else cast her eyes over a magazine or sometimes played cards or pretended to play adopting a german court custom either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage by nine o’clock the double doors of the big drawingroom were in a state of perpetual agitation opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home or if they had dined in town hurried from their café promising to return later since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other in order to conform with the princess’s timetable she meanwhile her mind fixed on her game or conversation made a show of not seeing the new arrivals and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat with a friendly smile for the women the latter thereupon sank before the upright presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low and to kiss it but at that moment the princess just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar raised the kneeling figure as though by main force and with incomparable grace and sweetness and kissed her on both cheeks a grace and sweetness that were conditional you may say upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee very likely and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish not as is generally supposed from want of breeding but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective and more completely still from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be to the recipient of an untold value which in a world based on equality would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth but this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things people of firstrate intelligence have held the opinion that a republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances and more recently that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of church and state after all the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war besides even if politeness were to vanish there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune lastly would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic this seems highly probable the political power of the popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either states or an army our cathedrals meant far less to a devout catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth and if the princesse de parme had been the sovereign ruler of a state no doubt i should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as i should speak of a president of the republic that is to say not at all

   as soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the princess the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience but first of all if the newcomer were of any importance held her for a moment in conversation making her sit down in an armchair

   when the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawingroom opened a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the house of bourbon the intimate friends of the princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes to which the young people had not the patience to listen more interested in the spectacle of living royalties with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour than in examining the relics of dead sovereigns too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure they knew absolutely nothing even in afteryears of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the monarchy and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the jardin d’acclimatation

   naturally the duchesse de guermantes by way of selfmortification did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an ‘after dinner’ call on the princess who kept her all the time by her side while she rallied the duke but on evenings when the duchess came to dine the princess took care not to invite her regular party and closed her doors to the world on rising from table for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting duchess on such evenings were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep they would be informed by the porter “her royal highness is not at home this evening” and would turn away but long before this many of the princess’s friends had known that on the day in question they would not be asked to her house these were a special set of parties a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission the excluded could with a practical certainty enumerate the roll of the elect and would say irritably among themselves “you know of course that oriane de guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff” with the help of this body the princesse de parme sought to surround the duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful but with several of the duchess’s favourites with several members of this glittering ‘staff’ the princesse de parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself no doubt the princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the duchesse de guermantes than in her own she could not deny that there was always a ‘crush’ on the duchess’s athome days or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her and in vain might she commit to memory oriane’s witty sayings copy her gowns serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign counsellor of legation and so whenever as had been the case with swann for instance at an earlier period there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the duchess’s and paid a call once in two years on the princesse de parme the latter felt no great desire even for the sake of amusing oriane to make to this swann or whoever he was the ‘advances’ of an invitation to dinner in a word having the duchess in her house was for the princess a source of endless perplexity so haunted was she by the fear that oriane would find fault with everything but in return and for the same reason when the princesse de parme came to dine with mme de guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect delightful she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand remember give satisfaction her inability to assimilate new ideas and people on this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity just as might a new way of decorating the dinnertable with festoons of fruit uncertain as she was which of the two it might be — the table decorations or my presence — that was the more distinctively one of those charms the secret of the success of oriane’s parties and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinnerparty to introduce them both what for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the princesse de parme brought to the duchess’s house was that element — amusing dangerous exciting — into which the princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety shock and delight as at the seaside on one of those days of ‘big waves’ of the danger of which the bathingmasters warn us simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim from which she used to emerge terrified happy rejuvenated and which was known as the wit of the guermantes the wit of the guermantes — a thing as nonexistent as the squared circle according to the duchess who regarded herself as the sole guermantes to possess it — was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of tours or the biscuits of rheims no doubt since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion certain intimate friends of the duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various guermantes too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind the holders not related to the duchess of this guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men fitted for a career to which whether it were in the arts diplomacy parliamentary eloquence or the army they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality of initiative of will power of health or of luck or possibly by snobbishness

   with certain people though these it must be admitted were the exception if the guermantes drawingroom had been the stumblingblock in their careers it had been without their knowledge thus a doctor a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues the mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the faculties are or were at least not so long since something more than a purely outward survival from a narrowminded past from a rigid sectarianism under the cap with its golden tassels like the high priest in the conical mitre of the jews the ‘professors’ were still in the years that preceded the dreyfus case fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas du boulbon was at heart an artist but was safe because he did not care for society cottard was always at the verdurins’ but mme verdurin was a patient besides he was protected by his vulgarity finally at his own house he entertained no one outside the faculty at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic but in powerful corporations where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity the most lofty conceptions of morality which weaken in an atmosphere that more tolerant freer at first becomes very soon dissolute a professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine like that of a doge which is to say a duke of venice enshrined in the ducal palace was as virtuous as deeply attached to noble principles but as unsparing of any alien element as that other duke excellent but terrible whom we know as m de saintsimon the alien here was the wordly doctor with other manners other social relations to make good the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them the strange ideas of a man of fashion if he concealed from them his duchesse de guermantes hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinnerparties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable he was unaware that in so doing he signed his own deathwarrant or rather he discovered this later when the council of ten had to fill a vacant chair and it was invariably the name of another doctor more normal it might be obviously inferior that leaped from the fatal urn when their ‘veto’ thundered from the ancient faculty as solemn as absurd and as terrible as the ‘juro’ that spelled the death of molière so too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations

   but this case was the rarest of all the type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the guermantes drawingroom was that of people who had voluntarily or so at least they supposed renounced all else everything that was incompatible with the wit of the guermantes with the courtesy of the guermantes with that indefinable charm odious to any ‘corporation’ however little centralised

   and the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the duchess’s drawingroom had been awarded the gold medal of the salon that another secretary to the bar council had made a brilliant start in the chamber that a third had ably served france as chargé d’affaires might have been led to regard as ‘failures’ people who had done nothing more now for twenty years but there were few who were thus ‘wellinformed’ and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people finding these old distinctions to be now valueless in the light of this very guermantes spirit of wit for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher and as a counterjumper a pair of eminent ministers one a trifle solemn the other addicted to puns of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company mme de guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinnertable since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the duchess’s favour those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the ‘career’ or the ‘service’ who had never stood for the chamber felt as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend or when they met her in the houses of royal personages of whom for that matter they thought very little or at least they said so that they themselves had chosen the better part albeit their melancholy air even in the midst of the gaiety seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion

   it must be recognised also that the refinement of social life the subtlety of conversation at the guermantes’ did also contain exiguous as it may have been an element of reality no official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of mme de guermantes whom the most powerful ministers had been unable to attract to their houses if in this drawingroom so many intellectual ambitions such noble efforts even had been for ever buried still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life certainly men of wit swann for instance regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth whom they despised but that was because what the duchesse de guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect it was according to her that superior more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent — wit and long ago at the verdurins’ when swann condemned brichot and elstir one as a pedant and the other as a clown despite all the learning of one and the other’s genius it was the infiltration of the guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so never would he have dared to present either of them to the duchess conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to brichot’s monologues and elstir’s hairsplittings the guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech whether in a serious or a farcical vein as alike of the most intolerable imbecility

   as for the guermantes of the true flesh and blood if the guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in to take an example those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words of expressing his thoughts and consequently of thinking it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation but imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate whereas there were several guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the courvoisiers

   to take as an instance what is called in another sense of the word imitation ‘giving imitations’ or among the guermantes was called ‘taking off’ mme de guermantes might succeed in this to perfection the courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the duchess was endeavouring to copy when she ‘gave an imitation’ of the duc de limoges the courvoisiers would protest “oh no he doesn’t really speak like that i met him again only yesterday at dinner at bebeth’s he talked to me all evening and he didn’t speak like that at all” whereas the guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed “gad what fun oriane is the odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him i feel i’m listening to him oriane do give us a little more limoges” now these guermantes and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the duchess imitated the duc de limoges would say admiringly’ “oh you really have got him” or “you do get him” might indeed be del void of wit according to mme de guermantes and in this respect she was right yet by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself of criticising people of what swann like the duke himself used to call her ‘phrasing’ of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the courvoisiers appeared ‘fearfully like’ oriane’s wit and was treated by them collectively as the ‘wit of the guermantes’ as these guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers oriane who kept the rest of the family rigorously at arm’slength and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood went to call on them now and then generally in company with the duke in the season when she drove out with him these visits were historic events the heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the princesse d’epinay who was ‘at home’ in her big drawingroom on the ground floor when she perceived afar off like the first glow of an innocuous fire or the ‘reconnaissances’ of an unexpected invasion making her way across the courtyard slowly in a diagonal course the duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance “why here comes oriane” she would say like an ‘on guard’ intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat to clear the rooms without panic half of those present dared not remain and rose at once to go “but no why sit down again i insist on keeping you a little longer” said the princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease to shew herself the great lady but in a voice that suddenly rang false “but you may want to talk to each other” “really you’re in a hurry oh very well i shall come and see you” replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart the duke and duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years without for that reason coming to know them any better while these in return barely said good day to them thinking this more discreet scarcely had they left the room before the duke began asking goodnaturedly who they were so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself owing to the crosspurposes of fate or the wretched state of oriane’s nerves never saw in his own house “tell me who was that little woman in the pink hat” “why my dear cousin you have seen her hundreds of times she’s the vicomtesse de tours who was a lamarzelle” “but do you know she’s quite goodlooking she seems clever too if it weren’t for a little flaw in her upper lip she’d be a regular charmer if there’s a vicomte de tours he can’t have any too bad a time oriane do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of your cousin hedwige de ligne” the duchesse de guermantes who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself let the conversation drop she bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife ‘“but” he resumed suddenly with emphasis “you mentioned the name lamarzelle i remember when i was in the chamber hearing a really remarkable speech made    ” “that was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now” “indeed what talent no my dear girl” he assured the vicomtesse d’egremont whom mme de guermantes could not endure but who refusing to stir from the princesse d’epinay’s drawingroom where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlourmaid and was ready to slap her own parlourmaid on returning home stayed there confused tearful but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room took their cloaks tried to make herself useful offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room “you are not to make tea for us let us just sit and talk quietly we are simple souls really honestly besides” he went on turning to the princesse d’epinay leaving the egremont lady blushing humble ambitious and full of zeal “we can only give you a quarter of an hour” this quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the duchess had said during the previous week and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband with great adroitness by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them obliged her as though against her will to repeat them

   the princesse d’epinay who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments went into ecstasies over her hat her sunshade her wit “talk to her as much as you like about her clothes” said the duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously “but for heaven’s sake don’t speak of her wit i should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife you are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother palamède” he went on knowing quite well that the princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife “in the first place i consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally i must admit said some quite good things to make bad puns but especially about my brother who is very susceptible and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me that would really be too much of a good thing” “but we never heard a word about it one of oriane’s puns it’s sure to be delicious oh do tell us” “no no” the duke went on still sulking though with a broader smile “i’m so glad you haven’t heard it seriously i’m very fond of my brother” “listen basin” broke in the duchess the moment having come for her to take up her husband’s cue “i can’t think why you should say that it might annoy palamède you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort he is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it you are making them think i said something nasty i simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it i don’t understand you” “you are making us terribly excited what is it all about” “oh obviously nothing serious” cried m de guermantes “you may have heard that my brother offered to give brézé the place he got from his wife to his sister marsantes” “yes but we were told that she didn’t want it she didn’t care for that part of the country the climate didn’t suit her” “very well some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her ‘he’s such a teaser charlus’ was what they actually said well you know brézé it’s a royal domain i should say it’s worth millions it used to be part of the crown lands it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of france there are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune and so when she heard the word ‘teaser’ applied to charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property oriane could not help exclaiming without meaning anything i must admit there wasn’t a trace of illnature about it for it came like a flash of lightning ‘teaser teaser then he must be teaser augustus’ you understand” he went on resuming his sulky tone having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wife’s witticism — and in some doubt as to the extent of mme d’epinay’s acquaintance with ancient history “you understand it’s an allusion to augustus caesar the roman emperor it’s too stupid a bad play on words quite unworthy of oriane and then you see i am more circumspect than my wife if i haven’t her wit i think of the consequences if anyone should be so illadvised as to repeat the remark to my brother there’ll be the devil to pay all the more” he went on “because as you know palamède is very high and mighty and very fussy also given to gossip and all that sort of thing so that quite apart from the question of his giving away brézé you must admit that ‘teaser augustus’ suits him down to the ground that is what justifies my wife’s remarks even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar she is always witty and does really describe people”

   and so thanks on one occasion to ‘teaser augustus’ on another to something else the visits paid by the duke and duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her ‘producer’ her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment those who had remained in the room the clever things that oriane had said “you hadn’t heard ‘teaser augustus’” asked the princesse d’epinay “yes” replied the marquise de baveno blushing as she spoke “the princesse de sarsina the la rochefoucauld one mentioned it to me not quite in the same words but of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room” she went on as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself “we were speaking of oriane’s latest — she was here just now” her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier “what has oriane been here” “yes you ought to have come a little sooner” the princesse d’epinay informed her not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss it was her fault alone if she had not been present at the creation of the world or at mme carvalho’s last performance “what do you think of oriane’s latest i must say i do enjoy ‘teaser augustus’” and the ‘saying’ would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week indeed the princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the princesse de parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her royal highness had heard the pun and repeated it to her “ah teaser augustus” said the princesse de parme her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration which begged however for a complementary elucidation which mme d’epinay was not loath to furnish “i must say ‘teaser augustus’ pleases me enormously as a piece of ‘phrasing’” she concluded as a matter of fact the word ‘phrasing’ was not in the least applicable to this pun but the princesse d’epinay who claimed to have assimilated her share of the guermantes spirit had borrowed from oriane the expressions ‘phrased’ and ‘phrasing’ and employed them without much discrimination new the princesse de parme who was not at all fond of mme d’epinay whom she considered plain knew to be miserly and believed on the authority of the courvoisiers to be malicious recognised this word ‘phrasing’ which she had heard used by mme de guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply she received the impression that it was in fact its ‘phrasing’ that formed the charm of ‘teaser augustus’ and without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the guermantes spirit so strong that she was on the point of inviting the princesse d’epinay to the opera she was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult mme de guermantes first as for mme d’epinay who unlike the courvoisiers paid endless attentions to oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the princesse de parme grasp the point of ‘teaser augustus’ and declared what a snob oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends “i should never have been able to see much of the princesse de parme even if i had cared to” she informed the friends who were dining with her “m d’epinay would not have allowed it for a moment because of her immorality” she explained alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the princess “but even if i had had a husband less strict in his views i must say i could never have made friends with her i don’t know how oriane can bear to see her every other day as she does i go there once a year and it’s all i can do to sit out my call” as for those of the courvoisiers who happened to be at victurnienne’s on the day of mme de guermantes’s visit the arrival of the duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the ‘ridiculous salaams’ that were made to her there one alone remained on the afternoon of ‘teaser augustus’ he did not entirely see the point but he did see part of it being an educated man and the courvoisiers went about repeating that oriane had called uncle palarned ‘caesar augustus’ which was according to them a good enough descrin tion of him but why all this endless talk about oriane they went on people couldn’t make more fuss about a queen “after all what is oriane i don’t say that the guermantes aren’t an old family but the courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank antiquity marriages we mustn’t forget that on the field of the cloth of gold when the king of england asked françois i who was the noblest of the lords there present ‘sire’ said the king of france ‘courvoisier’” but even if all the courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them oriane’s sayings would have fallen on deaf ears since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view if for instance a courvoisier found herself running short of chairs in the middle of a party or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember or if one of her servants said something stupid the courvoisier extremely annoyed flushed quivering with excitement would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence and when she had a visitor in the room and oriane was expected she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning “do you know her” fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on oriane but mme de guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder having had at her party some one whom nobody knew as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius at any rate the subject matter of their works

   the courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the duchesse de guermantes introduced into the life of society and by adapting it following an unerring instinct to the necessities of the moment made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who anxious to succeed in love or in politics was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of bussy d’amboise if the courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince the addition of a recognised wit of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences a courvoisier whose father had been a minister of the empire having to give an afternoon party to meet princesse mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but bonapartists of whom she knew practically none all the smart women of her acquaintance all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because from their legitimist views or connexions they might easily according to courvoisier logic give offence to the imperial highness the latter who in her own house entertained the flower of the faubourg saintgermain was quite surprised when she found at mme de courvoisier’s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an imperial prefect the widow of the director of posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to napoleon their stupidity and their dullness princesse mathilde however in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the duchesse de guermantes for her part took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the princess but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties all the talents all the celebrities who the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel would be acceptable to the niece of the emperor even when they belonged actually to the royal house there was not lacking indeed the due d’aumale and when on withdrawing the princess raising mme de guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand embraced her on both cheeks it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party the princesse de parme was courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters but unlike the courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the duchesse de guermantes engendered in her not as in them antipathy but admiration this astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the princess’s education mme de guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed but it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond mme de parme to stupefy that lady and as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors she had only to say that flaubert that archenemy of the bourgeois had been bourgeois through and through or that there was a great deal of italian music in wagner to open before the princess at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague a stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events no doubt the incapacity that prevented mme de parme from distinguishing the true wit of the guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain especially certain female guermantes of whom she was bewildered on hearing the duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads was one of the causes of the astonishment which the princess always felt on hearing mme de guermantes criticise other people but there was another cause also one which i who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life explained to myself by thinking that the duchess living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism in art is to creation extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great iphigénie is piccini’s and not gluck’s at a pinch the true phèdre that of pradon

   when a woman who was intelligent educated witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard mme de guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in ‘discovering’ the husband in the cambremer household for example if she had lived in that section of society at the time she would have decreed that mme de cambremer was stupid and that the really interesting person misunderstood delightful condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her was the marquis and the duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who after people have for seventy years been admiring hernani confesses to a preference for le lion amoureux and from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife a true saint for being married to a scoundrel one fine day mme de guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things i knew that it is not only over different works in the long course of centuries but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity i had not only seen bellini winterhalter the jesuit architects a restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called ‘worn out’ simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing i had seen preferred in saintebeuve alternately the critic and the poet musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces no doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in le cid or polyeucte some speech from le menteur which like an old plan furnishes information about the paris of the day but their predilection justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest is still too rational for our criticism run mad it will barter the whole of molière for a line froml’etourdi and even when it pronounces wagner’s tristan a bore will except a ‘charming note on the horns’ at the point where the hunt goes by this depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which mme de guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world recognised as a good fellow but a fool was a monster of egoism sharper than people thought — that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice that a good mother paid no attention to her children and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings as though spoiled by the nullity of life in society the intelligence and perception of mme de guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned and for the charm which she had felt in some warmhearted man not to change if he came too often to see her sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it the variations of the duchess’s judgment spared no one except her husband he alone had never been in love with her in him she had always felt an iron character indifferent to the caprices that she displayed contemptuous of her beauty violent of a will that would never bend the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity m de guermantes on the other hand pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced had once he had left them and to express derision of them only an associate permanent and identical who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful the most virtuous the cleverest the bestread member of the aristocracy as a wife whom he m de guermantes was only too fortunate to have found who cloaked all his irregularities entertained like no one else in the world and upheld for their drawingroom its position as the premier in the faubourg saintgermain this common opinion he himself shared often moved to illhumour against her he was proud of her if being as niggardly as he was fastidious he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in paris whenever mme de guermantes had just perpetrated with reference to the merits and defects which she suddenly transposed of one of their friends a new and succulent paradox she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling no doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old often less but this very element arbitrary and incalculable of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting only the patient on whom the duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour thus the reputation that mme de guermantes had of being an incomparable friend sentimental tender and devoted made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself she could at the most intervene later on as though under constraint by uttering a response to appease to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her this was precisely the part in which m de guermantes excelled

   as for social activities it was yet another form of pleasure arbitrary and spectacular that mme de guermantes felt in uttering with regard to them those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the princesse de parme but with this one of the duchess’s pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that i tried to understand in what it might consist the successive and contradictory edicts by which mme de guermantes continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion to taste those artificial emotions to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians we know that when a minister explains to the chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does as a matter of fact appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the minister’s conduct when he sees that the latter’s speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as “it’s most serious” ejaculated by a deputy whose name and titles are so long and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words “it’s most serious” occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine for instance in the days when m de guermantes prince des laumes sat in the chamber one used to read now and then in the paris newspapers albeit it was intended primarily for the méséglise division to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory

    monsieur de guermantesbouillon prince des laumes “this is serious” “hear hear” from the centre and some of the right benches loud exclamations from the extreme left

   the commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage minister but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply

    “the astonishment it is not too much to say the stupor” keen sensation on the right side of the house “that i have felt at the words of one who is still i presume a member of the government” thunder of applause    several undersecretaries of state for posts and telegraphs without deputies then crowded round the ministerial bench then rising from his seat nodded his head in the affirmative

   this ‘thunder of applause’ carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader he discovers to be an insult to the chamber monstrous in fact a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor bringing to light some piece of injustice preferring peace to war he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought which are not engraved on the human heart but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble

   it must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the guermantes circle and other groups in society later on is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as ‘reading between the lines’ if in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality there is equally stupidity through the want of it in the public who take everything ‘literally’ who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office ‘at his own request’ and say “he cannot have been dismissed since it was he who asked leave to retire”— a defeat when the russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand a refusal when a province having demanded its independence from the german emperor he grants it religious autonomy it is possible moreover to return to these sittings of the chamber that when they open the deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a minister they may ask one another innocently “there now i wonder what they can have been saying let’s hope it’s all settled” at the moment when the minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play the first words of the minister “there is no necessity for me to inform the chamber that i have too high a sense of what is the duty of the government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance” produce a dramatic effect for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the deputies had not imagined but precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the minister can succeed in making himself heard the minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues we are as deeply moved as on the day when the same minister failed to invite to a big official reception the president of the municipal council who was supporting the opposition and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship

   m de guermantes at this period in his life had to the great scandal of the courvoisiers frequently been among the crowd of deputies who came forward to congratulate the minister i have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the chamber and was being thought of in connexion with ministerial office or an embassy he was when a friend came to ask a favour of him infinitely more simple behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be duc de guermantes for if he said that nobility made no difference that he regarded his fellow deputies as equals he did not believe it for a moment he sought pretended to value but really despised political importance and as he remained in his own eyes m de guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable and in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have

   to return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians mme de guermantes was no less disconcerting to the guermantes the courvoisiers the faubourg in general and more than anyone the princesse de parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more the less one expected them if the new greek minister have a fancy dress ball everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the duchess would wear one thought that she would appear as the duchesse de bourgogne another suggested as probable the guise of princess of dujabar a third psyche finally a courvoisier having asked her “what are you going to wear oriane” provoked the one response of which nobody had thought “why nothing at all” which at once set every tongue wagging as revealing oriane’s opinion as to the true social position of the new greek minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess ‘was not expected’ to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new minister “i do not see that there is any necessity to go to the greek minister’s i do not know him i am not a greek why should i go to these people’s house i have nothing to do with them” said the duchess “but everybody will be there they say it’s going to be charming” cried mme de gallardon “still it’s just as charming sometimes to sit by one’s own fireside” replied mme de guermantes the courvoisiers could not get over this but the guermantes without copying it approved of their cousin’s attitude “naturally everybody isn’t in a position like oriane to break with all the conventions but if you look at it in one way you can’t say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where” naturally knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke mme de guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which ‘everybody was going’ or again when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem by stealing into the room without a single jewel and in another style of dress than what had been wrongly supposed to be essential to the occasion albeit she was antidreyfusard while retaining her belief in the innocence of dreyfus just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the princesse de ligne’s first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as general mercier entered the room and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics all heads were turned towards her at a good friday concert at which although a voltairean she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring christ upon the stage we know how important even for the great queens of society is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins so much so that the marquise d’amoncourt who from a need to say something a form of mania and also from want of perception was always making a fool of herself had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father m de montmorency “what makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when one’s mirror is simply stuffed with cards” very well at this point in the social year when people invited the duchesse de guermantes to dinner making every effort to see that she was not already engaged she declined for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought she was just starting on a cruise among the norwegian fjords which were so interesting people in society were stupefied and without any thought of following the duchess’s example derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it that of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called ‘the season’ the idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons twice as many afternoon teas three times as many evening parties the most brilliant mondays at the opera and tuesdays at the français to visit the norwegian fjords seemed to the courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of twenty thousand leagues under the sea but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm so that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask not merely “you’ve heard oriane’s latest joke” but “you know oriane’s latest” and on ‘oriane’s latest’ as on ‘oriane’s latest joke’ would follow the comment “how typical of oriane” “isn’t that pure oriane” oriane’s latest might be for instance that having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to cardinal x — bishop of macon whom m de guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called ‘monsieur de mascon’ thinking this to be ‘old french’ when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take and had no difficulty as to the opening words the choice lying between ‘eminence’ and ‘monseigneur’ but was puzzled as to the rest oriane’s letter to the general astonishment began ‘monsieur le cardinal’ following an old academic form or ‘my cousin’ this term being in use among the princes of the church the gsermantes and crowned heads who prayed to god to take each and all of them into ‘his fit and holy keeping’ to start people on the topic of an ‘oriane’s latest’ it was sufficient that at a performance at which all paris was present and a most charming play was being given when they looked for mme de guermantes in the boxes of the princesse de parme the princesse de guermantes countless other ladies who had invited her they discovered her sitting by herself in black with a tiny hat on her head in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose “you hear better when it’s a play that’s worth listening to” she explained to the scandal of the courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the guermantes and the princesse de parme who suddenly discovered that the ‘fashion’ of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date was a proof of greater originality and intelligence which need not astonish them coming from oriane than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinnerparty and ‘going on’ somewhere first such were the various kinds of surprise for which the princesse de parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to mme de guermantes one result of which was that during these dinnerparties at oriane’s her royal highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers

   among the elements which absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawingrooms that set the fashion for the faubourg saintgermain differentiated from them that of the duchesse de guermantes just as leibniz allows that each monad while reflecting the entire universe adds to it something of its own one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely goodlooking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that m de guermantes had made of them and whose presence revealed at once as does in other drawingrooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces they were all more or less alike for the duke had a taste for large women at once statuesque and looselimbed of a type halfway between the venus of milo and the samothracian victory often fair rarely dark sometimes auburn like the most recent who was at this dinner that vicomtesse d’arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily which slightly annoyed the duchess corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at guermantes and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that one winter which he had had to spend at parma he travelled back regularly every week to paris spending two days in the train in order to see her

   as a rule these handsome ‘supers’ had been his mistresses but were no longer as was mme d’arpajon’s case or were on the point of ceasing to be so it may well have been that the importance which the duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic but still not quite firstclass stock had prompted them even more than the good looks and generosity of the duke to yield to his desires not that the duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which m de guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else and so the reason why they were not invited by the duchess until their intimacy with the duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate and yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less for a first kiss in fact because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance in love it often happens that gratitude the desire to give pleasure makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other person’s expectation and selfinterest could have anticipated but then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances in the first place all the women who had responded to m de guermantes’s love and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him he had one after another segregated from the world he no longer allowed them to see anyone spent almost all his time in their company looked after the education of their children to whom now and again if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on he had occasion to present a little brother or sister and so if at the start of the connexion the prospect of an introduction to mme de guermantes which had never crossed the mind of the duke had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the lady’s point of view the duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in paris but a man with whom his new mistress was in love a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage while now and then a composite jealousy into which all these factors entered of mme de guermantes animated the duke’s mistresses but this case was the rarest of all besides when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived at a point when as a rule the duke had lost practically all interest in the matter his actions like everyone’s else being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist it frequently happened that it was mme de guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped and so greatly needed to discover against her dread husband a valuable ally this is not to say that save at rare moments in their own house where when the duchess talked too much he let fall a few words or more dreadful still preserved a silence which rendered her speechless m de guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms people who did not know them might easily misunderstand sometimes between the racing at deauville the course of waters and the return to guermantes for the shooting in the few weeks which people spend in paris since the duchess had a liking for caféconcerts the duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these the audience remarked at once in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two this hercules in his ‘smoking’ for in france we give to everything that is more or less british the one name that it happens not to bear in england his monocle screwed in his eye in his plump but finely shaped hand on the ringfinger of which there glowed a sapphire a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew softening them with an air of gentleness reserve courtesy and consideration when a verse struck him as amusing and not too indecent the duke would turn round with a smile to his wife letting her share by a twinkle of goodnatured understanding the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself and the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this nor anyone more enviable than the duchess — that woman outside whom every interest in the duke’s life lay that woman with whom he was not in love to whom he had been consistently unfaithful when the duchess felt tired they saw m de guermantes rise put on her cloak with his own hands arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter but despite these externals another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors the life of the duchess was by no means easy m de guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take as it generally happened the duchess’s part the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors charities to the poor even for herself later on a new and sumptuous motorcar but from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in mme de guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the duke’s mistresses were not exempt presently the duchess grew tired of them simultaneously at this moment the duke’s intimacy with mme d’arpajon was drawing to an end another mistress dawned on the horizon

   no doubt the love which m de guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh in the first place this love in dying bequeathed them like beautiful marbles — marbles beautiful to the duke become thus in part an artist because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love — which brought into juxtaposition in the duchess’s drawingroom their forms long inimical devoured by jealousies and quarrels and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship besides this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made m de guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye so much so that the exmistrêss become ‘the best of comrades’ who would do anything in the world for one is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend but during a period of transition the woman whom m de guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot made scenes shewed herself exacting appeared indiscreet became a nuisance the duke began to take a dislike to her then mme de guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her known as a kind woman mme de guermantes received the telephone messages the confidences the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint she laughed at them first with her husband then with a few chosen friends and imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her even to her face whatever the lady might say provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and duchess had recently fabricated for her mme de guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance

   meanwhile as she sat down to table the princesse de parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other princess to the opera and wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend mme de guermantes was preparing to sound her at this moment there entered m de grouchy whose train owing to some block on the line had been held up for an hour he made what excuses he could his wife had she been a courvoisier would have died of shame but mme de grouchy was not a guermantes for nothing as her husband was apologising for being late

    “i see” she broke in “that even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family”

    “sit down grouchy and don’t let them pull your leg” said the duke

    “i hope i move with the times still i must admit that the battle of waterloo had its points since it brought about the restoration of the bourbons and better still in a way which made them unpopular but you seem to be a regular nimrod”

    “well as a matter of fact i have had quite a good bag i shall take the liberty of sending the duchess six brace of pheasants tomorrow”

   an idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of mme de guermantes she insisted that m de grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants and making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom i had exchanged a few words on my way from the elstir room

    “poullein” she told him “you will go tomorrow and fetch m le comte’s pheasants and bring them straight back — you won’t mind will you grouchy if i make a few little presents basin and i can’t eat a whole dozen by ourselves”

    “but the day after tomorrow will be soon enough” said m de grouchy

    “no tomorrow suits me better” the duchess insisted

   poullein had turned pale his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed this was quite enough for the diversion of the duchess who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone “i know it’s your day out” she went on to poullein “all you’ve got to do is to change with georges he can take tomorrow off and stay in the day after”

   but the day after poullein’s sweetheart would not be free a holiday then was of no account to him as soon as he was out of the room everyone complimented the duchess on the interest she took in her servants “but i only behave towards them as i like people to behave to me” “that’s just it they can say they’ve found a good place with you” “oh nothing so very wonderful but i think they all like me that one is a little annoying because he’s in love he thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face”

   at this point poullein reappeared “you’re quite right” said m de grouchy “he doesn’t look much like smiling with those fellows one has to be good but not too good” “i admit i’m not a very dreadful mistress he’ll have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them” “there are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place” said m de grouchy for envy makes men blind

    “oriane” began the princesse de parme “i had a visit the other day from your cousin heudicourt of course she’s a highly intelligent woman — she’s a guermantes one can say no more but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue” the duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction mme de guermantes began to smile gradually the princess became aware of their pantomime “but    do you mean to say you don’t agree with me” she stammered with growing uneasiness “really ma’am it’s too good of you to pay any attention to basin’s faces now’ basin you’re not to hint nasty things about our cousins” “he thinks her too wicked” inquired the princess briskly “oh dear me no” replied the duchess “i don’t know who told your highness that she was spiteful on the contrary she’s an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone or did any harm to any one” “ah” sighed mme de parme greatly relieved “i must say i never noticed anything myself but i know it’s often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit    ” “ah now that is a quality of which she has even less” “less wit” asked the stupefied princess “come now oriane” broke in the duke in a plaintive tone casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement “you heard the princess tell you that she was a superior woman” “but isn’t she” “superior in chest measurement at any rate” “don’t listen to him ma’am he’s not sincere she’s as stupid as a h’m goose” came in a loud and rasping voice from mme de guermantes who a great deal more ‘old french’ even than the duke when he was not trying did often deliberately seek to be but in a manner the opposite of the laceneckcloth deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil “but she’s the best woman in the world besides i don’t really know that one can call it stupidity when it’s carried to such a point as that i don’t believe i ever met anyone quite like her she’s a case for a specialist there’s something pathological about her she’s a sort of ‘innocent’ or ‘cretin’ or an ‘arrested development’ like the people you see in melodramas or in l’arlésienne i always ask myself when she comes to see me whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn which makes me a little nervous always” the princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict “she repeated to me — and so did mme d’epinay — what you said about ‘teaser augustus’ it’s delicious” she put in

   m de guermantes explained the joke to me i wanted to tell him that his brother who pretended not to know me was expecting me that same evening at eleven o’clock but i had not asked robert whether i might mention this engagement and as the fact that m de charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the duchess i judged it more tactful to say nothing “‘teaser augustus’ was not bad” said m de guermantes “but mme d’heudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon” “no indeed do tell me” “now basin you keep quiet in the first place it was a stupid remark and it will make the princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin though i don’t know why i should call her my cousin she’s one of basin’s cousins still i believe she is related to me in some sort of way” “oh” cried the princesse de parme at the idea that she could possibly think mme de guermantes stupid and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the duchess from the place she held in her estimation “besides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit as what i said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also it seems to me inopportune to repeat it” “‘deny her’ ‘inopportune’ how well she expresses herself” said the duke with a pretence of irony to win admiration for the duchess “now then basin you’re not to make fun of your wife” “i should explain to your royal highness” went on the duke “that oriane’s cousin may be superior good stout anything you like to mention but she is not exactly — what shall i say — lavish” “no i know she’s terribly closefisted” broke in the princess “i should not have ventured to use the expression but you have hit on exactly the right word you can see it in her housekeeping and especially in the cooking which is excellent but strictly rationed” “which leads to some quite amusing scenes” m de bréauté interrupted him “for instance my dear basin i was down at heudicourt one day when you were expected oriane and yourself they had made the most elaborate preparations when during the afternoon a footman brought in a telegram to say that you weren’t coming” “that doesn’t surprise me” said the duchess who not only was difficult to secure but liked people to know as much “your cousin read the telegram was duly distressed then immediately without losing her head telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself called the footman back ‘tell the cook not to put on the chicken’ she shouted after him and that evening i heard her asking the butler ‘well what about the beef that was left over yesterday aren’t you going to let us have that’” “all the same one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best” said the duke who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school “i don’t know any house where one gets better food” “or less” put in the duchess “it is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself” went on the duke “one keeps one’s appetite” “oh if it’s to be taken as a cure it’s certainly more hygienic than sumptuous not that it’s as good as all that” added mme de guermantes who was not at all pleased that the title of ‘best table in paris’ should be awarded to any but her own “with my cousin it’s just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a oneact play or a sonnet the sort of thing people call a little masterpiece trifles that are perfect gems in fact the one thing i loathe most in the world the cooking at zénaïde’s is not bad but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious there are some things her cook does quite well and others that he spoils i have had some thoroughly bad dinners there as in most houses only they’ve done me less harm there because the stomach is after all more sensitive to quantity than to quality” “well to get on with the story” the duke concluded “zénaïde insisted that oriane should go to luncheon there and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party ‘you must come’ zénaïde insisted boasting of all the good things there would be to eat ‘you are going to have a purée of chestnuts i need say no more than that and there will be seven littlebouchées à la reine’ ‘seven little bouchées’ cried oriane ‘that means that we shall be at least eightl’” there was silence for a few seconds and then the princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder “ah ‘then we shall be eight’— it’s exquisite how very well phrased” she said having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by mme d’epinay which this time was more appropriate “oriane that was very charming of the princess she said your remark was well phrased” “but my dear you’re telling me nothing new i know how clever the princess is” replied mme de guermantes who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a royal personage and in praise of her own wit “i am very proud that ma’am should appreciate my humble phrasings i don’t remember though that i ever did say such a thing and if i did it must have been to flatter my cousin for if she had ordered seven ‘mouthfuls’ the mouths if i may so express myself would have been a round dozen if not more”

    “she used to have all m de bornier’s manuscripts” went on the princess still speaking of mme d’heudicourt and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady “she must have dreamed it i don’t believe she ever even know him” said the duchess “what is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time” put in the vicomtesse d’arpajon who allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of europe was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact “surely oriane” said m de guermantes with ulterior purpose “you can’t have forgotten that dinnerparty where you had m de bornier sitting next to you” “but basin” the duchess interrupted him “if you mean to inform me that i knew m de bornier why of course i did he even called upon me several times but i could never bring myself to invite him to the house because i should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol as for the dinner you mean i remember it only too well but it was certainly not at zénaïde’s who never set eyes on bornier in her life and would probably think if you spoke to her of the fille de roland that you meant a bonaparte princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the king of greece no it was at the austrian embassy dear hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician i quite thought i had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me i was obliged to stop my nose as best i could all through dinner until the gruyère came round i didn’t dare to breathe” m de guermantes whose secret object was attained made a furtive examination of his guests’ faces to judge the effect of the duchess’s pleasantry “you were speaking of correspondence i must say i thought gambetta’s admirable” she went on to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical m de bréauté who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate after which he wiped his monocle

    “gad it’s infernally dull that fille de roland” said m de guermantes with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past “still there were some quite good lines in it and a patriotic sentiment”

   i let it be understood that i had no admiration for m de bornier “indeed you have some fault to find with him” the duke asked with a note of curiosity for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a loveaffair “i see you’ve got your knife into him what did he do to you you must tell us why yes there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn’t run him down it’s longwinded the fille de roland but it’s quite strong in parts” “strong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that” mme de guermantes broke in sarcastically “if this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him i can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils” “i must confess though to ma’am” the duke went on addressing the princesse de parme “that quite apart from thefille de roland in literature and even in music i am terribly oldfashioned no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste you won’t believe me perhaps but in the evenings if my wife sits down to the piano i find myself calling for some old tune by auber or boieldieu or even beethoven that’s the sort of thing that appeals to me as for wagner he sends me to sleep at once” “you are wrong there” said mme de guermantes “in spite of his insufferable longwindedness wagner was a genius lohengrin is a masterpiece even in tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about and the chorus of spinners in the flying dutchman is a perfect marvel” “a’n’t i right babal” said m de guermantes turning to m de bréauté “what we like is

   les rendezvous de noble compagnie
   se donnent tous en ce charmant séjour

it’s delicious and fra diavolo and the magic flute and the chalet and the marriage of figaro and the diamants de la couronne — there’s music for you it’s the same thing in literature for instance i adore balzac thebal de sceaux the mohicans de paris” “oh my dear if you are going to begin about balzac we shall never hear the end of it do wait keep it for some evening when mémé‘s here he’s even better he knows it all by heart” irritated by his wife’s interruption the duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence and his huntsman’s eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols meanwhile mme d’arpajon had been exchanging with the princesse de parme upon tragic and other kinds of poetry a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until i caught the following from mme d’arpajon “oh ma’am is sure to be right i quite admit he makes the world seem ugly because he’s unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful i agree with your highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things quite unintelligible errors of taste that it is difficult to understand that it’s as much trouble to read as if it was written in russian or chinese for of course it’s anything in the world but french still when one has taken the trouble how richly one is rewarded it’s so full of imagination” of this little lecture i had missed the opening sentences i gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was victor hugo but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as chinese or russian was

   lorsque l’enfant paraît le cercle de famille
   applaudit à grands cris

a piece dating from the poet’s earliest period and perhaps even nearer to mme deshoulières than to the victor hugo of the légende des siècles far from condemning mme d’arpajon as absurd i saw her the only one at that table so matteroffact so nondescript at which i had sat down with such keen disappointment i saw her in my mind’s eye crowned with that lace cap with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side which was worn by mme de rémusat mme de broglie mme de saintaularie all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from sophocles schiller and theimitation but in whom the earliest poetry of the romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest verses of stéphane mallarmé “mme d’arpajon is very fond of poetry” said the princesse de parme to her hostess impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered “no she knows absolutely nothing about it” replied mme de guermantes in an undertone taking advantage of the fact that mme d’arpajon who was dealing with an objection raised by general de beautreillis was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the duchess “she has become literary since she’s been forsaken i can tell your highness that it is i who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever basin hasn’t been to see her which is practically every day and yet it isn’t my fault after all if she bores him and i can’t force him to go to her although i would rather he were a little more faithful to her because then i shouldn’t see quite so much of her myself but she drives him crazy and there’s nothing extraordinary in that she isn’t a bad sort but she’s boring to a degree you can’t imagine and all this because basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her and to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little streetwalker and goes about with a long face if i don’t request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me oh life really is too tedious” the duchess languorously concluded mme d’arpajon bored m de guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another whom i discovered to be the marquise de surgisleduc at this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table and it struck me that still disconsolate he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty for i noticed that in handing the dish to m de châtellerault he performed his task so awkwardly that the duke’s elbow came in contact several times with his own the young duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes this good humour seemed to me on the guest’s part to betoken a kindness of heart but the persistence of his smile led me to think that aware of the servant’s discomfiture what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy “but my dear you know you’re not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about victor hugo” went on the duchess this time addressing mme d’arpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the general with a troubled air “you mustn’t expect to launch that young genius everybody knows that he has talent what is utterly detestable is the victor hugo of the last stage the légende des siècles i forget all their names but in the feuilles d’automne the chants du crépuscule there’s a great deal that’s the work of a poet a true poet even in thecontemplations” went on the duchess whom none of her listeners dared to contradict and with good reason “there are still some quite pretty things but i confess that i prefer not to venture farther than thecrepuscule and then in the finer poems of victor hugo and there really are some one frequently comes across an idea even a profound idea” and with the right shade of sentiment bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice and fixing straight in front of her a charming dreamy gaze the duchess said slowly “take this

   la douleur est un fruit
   dieu ne le fait pas croître
   sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter

or better still

   les morts durent bien peu
   hélas dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussière
   moins vite qu’en nos coeurs”

and while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips the duchess fastened on mme d’arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming clear blue eyes i was beginning to know them as well as her voice with its heavy drawl its harsh savour in those eyes and in that voice i recognised much of the life of nature round combray certainly in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the guermantes family which had for long remained more localised more hardy wilder more provoking than the rest and also the usage of really distinguished people and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes peculiarities all of which the regal position of mme de guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread it appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested and who less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen entrenched on their provincial estates or in paris in a faubourg saintgermain of no brilliance possessed this voice also but had bridled it corrected it softened it so far as lay in their power just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models but oriane was so much more intelligent so much richer above all so much more in fashion than her sisters she had so effectively when princesse des laumes behaved just as she pleased in the company of the prince of wales that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction and had made of it in the social order with the courage of originality rewarded by success what in the theatrical order a réjane a jeanne granier which implies no comparison naturally between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses had made of theirs something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain réjane and granier sisters whom no one has ever known strove to conceal as a defect

   to all these reasons for displaying her local originality the favourite writers of mme de guermantes — mérimée meilhac and halévy — had brought in addition with the respect for what was natural a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes besides the duchess was fully capable adding to these influences an artistic research of her own of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most ‘he de france’ most ‘champenoise’ since if not quite to the same extent as her sisterinlaw marsantes she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old french writer and when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech it was albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of mme de guermantes — almost the same feeling if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words as one has on hearing an old song then as i looked at as i listened to mme de guermantes i could see a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes a sky of the he de france or of champagne spread itself greyblue oblique with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of saintloup

   thus by these several formations mme de guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic france then from a far later source the manner in which the duchesse de broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with victor hugo under the july monarchy and finally a keen taste for the literature that sprang from mérimée and meilhac the first of these formations attracted me more than the second did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the faubourg saintgermain so different from what i had imagined it to be but even the second i preferred to the last for so long as mme de guermantes was being almost spontaneously a guermantes and nothing more her pailleronism her taste for the younger dumas were reflected and deliberate as this taste was the opposite of my own she was productive to my mind of literature when she talked to me of the faubourg saintgermain and never seemed to me so stupidly faubourg saintgermain as when she was talking literature

   moved by this last quotation mme d’arpajon exclaimed “’ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussière’ sir you must write that down for me on my fan” she said to m de guermantes “poor woman i feel sorry for her” said the princesse de parme to mme de guermantes “no really ma’am you must not be softhearted she has only got what she deserves” “but — you’ll forgive me for saying this to you — she does really love him all the same” “oh not at all she isn’t capable of it she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting victor hugo when she repeated a line from musset listen” the duchess went on in a tone of melancholy “nobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment but let me give you an instance only yesterday she made a terrible scene with basin your highness thinks perhaps that it was because he’s in love with other women because he no longer loves her not in the least it was because he won’t put her sons down for the jockey does ma’am call that the behaviour of a woman in love no i will go farther” mme de guermantes added with precision “she is a person of singular insensibility” meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that m de guermantes had listened to his wife talking about victor hugo ‘pointblank’ and quoting his poetry the duchess might frequently annoy him at moments like this he was proud of her “oriane is really extraordinary she can talk about anything she has read everything she could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on victor hugo whatever subject you take up she is ready for you she can hold her own with the most learned scholars this young man must be quite captivated”

    “do let us change the conversation” mme de guermantes went on “because she’s dreadfully susceptible you will think me quite oldfashioned” she began turning to me “i know that nowadays it’s considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry poetry with some thought in it” “oldfashioned” asked the princesse de parme quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected albeit she knew that the conversation of the duchesse de guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks that breathcatching panic that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to ‘restore her circulation’

    “for my part no oriane” said mme de brissac “i don’t in the least object to victor hugo’s having ideas quite the contrary but i do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities after all it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature there are quite enough ugly things already in real life why can’t we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading a distressing spectacle from which we should turn away in real life that is what attracts victor hugo”

    “victor hugo is not as realistic as zola though surely” asked the princesse de parme the name of zola did not stir a muscle on the face of m de beautreillis the general’s antidreyfusism was too deeprooted for him to seek to give expression to it and his goodnatured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw “i know you’re related to admiral jurien de la gravière” was murmured to me with an air of connivance by mme de varambon the lady in waiting to the princesse de parme an excellent but limited woman procured for the princess in the past by the duke’s mother she had not previously uttered a word to me and i could never afterwards despite the admonitions of the princess and my own protestations get out of her mind the idea that i was in some way connected with the academician admiral who was a complete stranger to me the obstinate persistence of the princesse de parme’s lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of admiral jurien de la gravière was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness but the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes less serious more elaborate unconscious or deliberate which accompany one’s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one i remember that a friend of the guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that i was a great friend of his cousin mme de chaussegros “she is a charming person she’s so fond of you” i scrupulously though quite vainly insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake as i did not know mme de chaussegros “then it’s her sister you know it comes to the same thing she met you in scotland” i had never been in scotland and took the futile precaution in my honesty of letting my informant know this it was mme de chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me and no doubt sincerely believed it as a result of some initial confusion for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me and as after all the world in which i moved was precisely that in which mme de chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason to say that i was intimate with the chaussegros was literally a mistake but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as i then was it therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself he neither lowered nor exalted me from the worldly point of view in the idea which he continued to hold of me and when all is said for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment as if we were to go on the boards when another person forms a false idea of us imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed and continued for the rest of her life to be committed in spite of my denials by the imbecile lady in waiting to mme de parme rooted for all time in the belief that i was related to the tiresome admiral jurien de la gravière “she is not very strong in her head” the duke confided to me “and besides she ought not to indulge in too many libations i fancy she’s slightly under the influence of bacchus” as a matter of fact mme de varambon had drunk nothing but water but the duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech “but zola is not a realist ma’am he’s a poet” said mme de guermantes drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius agreeably buffeted hitherto in the course of this bath of wit a bath stirred for herself which she was taking this evening and which she considered must be particularly good for her health letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another before this the most enormous of them all the princesse de parme jumped for fear of being knocked over and it was in a choking voice as though she were quite out of breath that she now gasped “zola a poet” “why yes” answered the duchess with a laugh entranced by this display of suffocation “your highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches you will tell me that he touches just what — perish the thought but he makes it into something colossal his is the epic dungheap he is the homer of the sewers he has not enough capitals to print cambronne’s word” despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel the princess was enchanted never had she felt better she would not have exchanged for an invitation to schonbrunn albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her these divine dinnerparties at mme de guermantes’s made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt “he writes it with a big c” cried mme d’arpajon “surely with a big m i think my dear” replied mme de guermantes exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied “did you ever hear such an idiot” “wait a minute now” mme de guermantes turned to me fixing on me a tender smiling gaze because as an accomplished hostess she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially to give me if i required it an opportunity for exhibiting mine “wait” she urged me gently waving her feather fan so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality and that she might be found wanting in none of them making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce “wait now i do believe that zola has actually written an essay on elstir the painter whose things you were looking at just now — the only ones of his really that i care for” she concluded as a matter of fact sh hated elstir’s work but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house i asked m de guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom i recognised as the same person whose portrait the guermantes also had and had hung beside the other both dating more or less from the same early period in which elstir’s personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from manet “good lord yes” he replied “i know it’s a fellow who is quite wellknown and no fool either in his own line but i have no head for names i have it on the tip of my tongue monsieur    monsieur    oh well it doesn’t matter i can’t remember it swann would be able to tell you it was he who made mme de guermantes buy all that stuff she is always too goodnatured afraid of hurting people’s feelings if she refuses to do things between ourselves i believe he’s landed us with a lot of rubbish what i can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of maecenas to m elstir he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him as a compliment to this man — if you can call that sort of thing a compliment — he has painted him standing about among that crowd where with his sundaygotomeeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect he may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat with that thing on his head among all those bareheaded girls he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzledazzle but tell me you seem quite gone on his pictures if i had only known i should have got up the subject properly not that there’s any need to rack one’s brains over the meaning of m elstir’s work as one would for ingres’s source or the princes in the towier by paul delaroche what one appreciates in his work is that it’s shrewdly observed amusing parisian and then one passes on to the next thing one doesn’t need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing i know of course that they’re merely sketches still i don’t feel myself that he puts enough work into them swann was determined that we should buy abundle of asparagus in fact it was in the house for several days there was nothing else in the picture a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you’re eating now but i must say i declined to swallow m elstir’s asparagus he asked three hundred francs for them three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus a louis that’s as much as they’re worth even if they are out of season i thought it a bit stiff when he puts real people into his pictures as well there’s something rather caddish something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me i am surprised to see a delicate mind a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing” “i don’t know why you should say that basin” interrupted the duchess who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained “i am by no means prepared to admit that there’s nothing distinguished in elstir’s pictures you have to take it or leave it but it’s not always lacking in talent and you must admit that the ones i bought are singularly beautiful” “well oriane in that style of thing i’d a thousand times rather have the little study by m vibert we saw at the watercolour exhibition there’s nothing much in it if you like you could take it in the palm of your hand but you can see the man’s clever through and through that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks it’s a perfect little poem of subtlety and in fact goes really deep” “i believe you know m elstir” the duchess went on to me “as a man he’s quite pleasant” “he is intelligent” said the duke “one is surprised when one talks to him that his painting should be so vulgar” “he is more than intelligent he is really quite clever” said the duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about “didn’t he once start a portrait of you oriane” asked the princesse de parme “yes in shrimp pink” replied mme de guermantes “but that’s not going to hand his name down to posterity it’s a ghastly thing basin wanted to have it destroyed” this last statement was one which mme de guermantes often made but at other times her appreciation of the picture was different “i do not care for his painting but he did once do a good portrait of me” the former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the duchess of her portrait the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence the former was inspired in her by coquetry the latter by vanity “make a portrait of you look ghastly why then it can’t be a portrait it’s a falsehood i don’t know one end of a brush from the other but i’m sure if i were to paint you merely putting you down as i see you i should produce a masterpiece” said the princesse de parme ingenuously “he sees me probably as i see myself without any allurements” said the duchesse de guermantes with the look melancholy modest and coaxing which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what elstir had portrayed “that portrait ought to appeal to mme de gallardon” said the duke “because she knows nothing about pictures” asked the princesse de parme who knew that mme de guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin “but she’s a very good woman isn’t she” the duke assumed an air of profound astonishment “why basin don’t you see the princess is making fun of you” the princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing “she knows as well as you do that gallardonette is an old poison” went on mme de guermantes whose vocabulary limited as a rule to all these old expressions was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of pampille but which have in real life become so rare dishes where the jellies the butter the gravy the quails are all genuine permit of no alloy where even the salt is brought specially from the saltmarshes of brittany from her accent her choice of words one felt that the basis of the duchess’s conversation came directly from guermantes in this way the duchess differed profoundly from her nephew saintloup the prey of so many new ideas and expressions it is difficult when one’s mind is troubled by the ideas of kant and the longings of baudelaire to write the exquisite french of henri iv which meant that the very purity of the duchess’s language was a sign of limitation and that in her both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation here again mme de guermantes’s mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion it had been able to preserve that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed her mind of a formation so anterior to my own was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore mme de guermantes offered me domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy by the respect due to another person’s intellectual worth all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle tortured cats gouged out the eyes of rabbits and albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue might equally well have been a good few years ago now the most brilliant mistress of the prince de sagan only she was incapable of realising what i had sought for in her the charm of her historic name and the tiny quantity of it that i had found in her a rustic survival from guermantes were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm a misunderstanding so entirely natural and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world one however that profoundly disturbs him so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people as in the theatre in his travels and indeed in love m de guermantes having declared following upon elstir’s asparagus and those that were brought round after the financière chicken that green asparagus grown in the open air which as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself e de clermonttonnerre “have not the impressive rigidity of their sisters” ought to be eaten with eggs “one man’s meat is another man’s poison as they say” replied m de bréauté “in the province of canton in china the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolan’s eggs completely rotten” m de bréauté the author of an essay on the mormons which had appeared in the revue des deux mondes moved in none but the most aristocratic circles but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect with the result that from his presence were it at all regular in a woman’s house one could tell that she had a ‘salon’ he pretended to a loathing of society and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her they all believed him whenever with death in his heart he resigned himself to attending a big party at the princesse de parme’s he summoned them all to accompany him to keep up his courage and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group so that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success applying certain maxims of the guermantes spirit he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season and when a woman who was a snob and consequently still without any definite position began to go everywhere he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her to allow himself to be introduced to her his hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness but made the simpletons in other words everyone believe that he was immune from snobbishness “babal always knows everything” exclaimed the duchesse de guermantes “i think it must be charming a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs eggs of the year of the comet i can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them i must say you get the same thing at aunt madeleine’s” mme de villeparisis’s “where everything’s served in a state of putrefaction eggs included” then as mme d’arpajon protested “but my dear phili you know it as well as i do you can see the chicken in the egg what i can’t understand is how they manage not to fall out it’s not an omelette you get there it’s a poultryyard you were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday there was a brill cooked in carbolic i assure you it wasn’t a dinnertable it was far more like an operatingtable really norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism he actually asked for more” “i believe i saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on m bloch” m de guermantes perhaps to give to an israelite name a more foreign sound pronounced the ‘ch’ in bloch not like a ‘k’ but as in the german ‘hoch’ “when he said about some poit” poet “or other that he was sublime châtellerault did his best to break m bloch’s shins the fellow didn’t understand in the least and thought my nephew’s kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him” at this point m de guermantes coloured slightly “he did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his ‘sublimes’ chucked about all over the place like that in short aunt madeleine who doesn’t keep her tongue in her pocket turned on him with ‘indeed sir and what epithet do you keep for m de bousset’” m de guermantes thought that when one mentioned a famous name the use of ‘monsieur’ and a particle was eminently ‘old school’ “that put him in his place all right” “and what answer did this m bloch make” came in a careless tone from mme de guermantes who running short for the moment of original ideas felt that she must copy her husband’s teutonic pronunciation “ah i can assure you m bloch did not wait for any more he’s still running” “yes i remember quite well seeing you there that evening” said mme de guermantes with emphasis as though coming from her there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself “it is always so interesting at my aunt’s at the last party she gave which was of course when i met you i meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were sitting wasn’t françois coppée you must know who everyone is” she went on sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry and also out of ‘consideration’ for myself the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well versed in literature i assured the duchess that i had not observed any celebrities at mme de villeparisis’s party “what” she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said perhaps even than she thought “what there were no famous authors there you astonish me why i saw all sorts of quite impossible people” i remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party mme de villeparisis had introduced bloch to mme alphonse de rothschild but my friend had not caught the name and thinking he was talking to an old english lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty when mme de villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered quite distinctly this time “the baronne alphonse de rothschild” thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through bloch’s arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate that he had undergone so to speak a momentary failure of heart and brain alike and cried aloud in the dear old lady’s presence “if i’d only known” an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards his remark was of no great interest but i remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life under the stress of an exceptional emotion people do say what is in their minds “i fancy mme de villeparisis is not absolutely    moral” said the princesse de parme who knew that the best people did not visit the duchess’s aunt and from what the duchess herself had just been saying that one might speak freely about her but mme de guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism she hastened to add “though of course intellect carried to that degree excuses everything” “but you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does” replied the duchess “which is really quite mistaken it’s just what mémé was saying to me only yesterday” she blushed a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes i formed the supposition that m de charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation as he had sent robert to ask me not to go to her house i had the impression that the blush — equally incomprehensible to me — which had tinged the duke’s cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same cause “my poor aunt — she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions and really there’s no more middleclass serious commonplace mind in paris she will go down as a patron of the arts which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was and as for her private life so far from being a depraved woman she was so much made for marriage so conjugal from her cradle that not having succeeded in keeping a husband who incidentally was a cad she has never had a loveaffair which she hasn’t taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony with the same susceptibilities the same quarrels the same fidelity by which token those relations are often the most sincere you’ll find in fact more inconsolable lovers than husbands” “yet oriane if you take the case of your brotherinlaw palamède you were speaking about just now no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor mme de charlus has been” “ah” replied the duchess “your highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion people don’t all like to be mourned in the same way each of us has his preferences” “still he did make a regular cult of her after her death it is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living” “for one thing” retorted mme de guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose “we go to their funerals which we never do for the living” m de guermantes gave a sly glance at m de bréauté as though to provoke him into laughter at the duchess’s wit “at the same time i frankly admit” went on mme de guermantes “that the manner in which i should like to be mourned by a man i loved would not be that adopted by my brotherinlaw” the duke’s face darkened he did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments especially about m de charlus “you are very particular his grief set an example to everyone” he reproved her stiffly but the duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry “oh very well just as you like — he does set an example i never said he didn’t he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon he misses her enormously but — as he’d mourn for a cousin a grandmother a sister it is not the grief of a husband it is true that they were a pair of saints which makes it all rather exceptional” m de guermantes infuriated by his wife’s chatter fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded “i don’t wish to say anything against poor mémé who by the way could not come this evening” went on the duchess “i quite admit there’s no one like him he’s delightful he has a delicacy a warmth of heart that you don’t as a rule find in men he has a woman’s heart mémé has” “what you say is absurd” m de guermantes broke in sharply “there’s nothing effeminate about mémé i know nobody so manly as he is” “but i am not suggesting that he’s the least bit in the world effeminate do at least take the trouble to understand what i say” retorted the duchess “he’s always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother” she added turning to the princesse de parme “it’s very charming it’s a pleasure to hear him there’s nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other” replied the princess as many a humbler person might have replied for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian

    “as we’re discussing your family oriane” said the princess “i saw your nephew saintloup yesterday i believe he wants to ask you to do something for him” the duc de guermantes bent his olympian brow when he did not himself care to do a service he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone “why didn’t he tell me about it himself” said the duchess “he was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself he would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense like many people we know to be content with being a fool it’s his veneer of knowledge that’s so terrible he wants to preserve an open mind — open to all the things he doesn’t understand he talks to you about morocco it’s appalling”

    “he can’t go back there because of rachel” said the prince de foix “surely now that they’ve broken it off” interrupted m de bréauté “so far from breaking it off i found her a couple of days ago in robert’s rooms they didn’t look at all like people who’d quarrelled i can assure you” replied the prince de foix who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage robert’s chances of marrying and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end

    “that rachel was speaking to me about you i see her like that in the mornings on the way to the champselysées she’s a kind of headinair as you say what you call ‘unlaced’ a sort of ‘dame aux camélias’ only figuratively speaking of course” this speech was addressed to me by prince von who liked always to appear conversant with french literature and parisian catchwords

    “why that’s just what it was — morocco” exclaimed the princess flinging herself into this opening “what on earth can he want in morocco” asked m de guermantes sternly “oriane can do absolutely nothing for him there as he knows perfectly well” “he thinks he invented strategy” mme de guermantes pursued the theme “and then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things which doesn’t prevent him from making blots all over his letters the other day he announced that he’d been given some sublime potatoes and that he’d taken a sublime stage box” “he speaks latin” the duke went one better “what latin” the princesse gasped “‘pon my soul he does ma’am can ask oriane if i’m not telling the truth” “why of course ma’am the other day he said to us straight out without stopping to think ‘i know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi’ i can repeat the phrase now to your highness because after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists we succeeded in reconstructing it but robert flung it out without pausing for breath one could hardly make out that there was latin in it he was just like a character in the malade imaginaire and all this referred simply to the death of the empress of austria” “poor woman” cried the princess “what a delicious creature she was” “yes” replied the duchess “a trifle mad a trifle headstrong but she was a thoroughly good woman a nice kindhearted lunatic the only thing i could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her they always came loose halfway through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she’d have swallowed them” “that rachel was speaking to me about you she told me that young saintloup worshipped you that he was fonder of you than he was of her” said prince von to me devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke his face scarlet his teeth bared by his perpetual grin “but in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me” said i “not at all she told me all sorts of nice things about you the prince de foix’s mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her you don’t understand come home with me and i’ll explain it all to you” “i’m afraid i can’t i’m going on to m de charlus at eleven” “why he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven but if you must go to him at least come with me as far as the théâtre français you will be in the periphery” said the prince who thought doubtless that this last word meant ‘proximity’ or possibly ‘centre’

   but the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and i declined saying that a friend was coming to call for me this reply seemed to me in no way offensive the prince however apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me

    “i really must go and see the queen of naples what a grief it must be to her” said or at least appeared to me to have said the princesse de parme for her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me albeit in an undertone by prince von who had doubtless been afraid if he spoke louder of being overheard by the prince de foix “oh dear no” replied the duchess “i don’t believe it has been any grief at all” “none at all you do always fly to extremes so oriane” said m de guermantes resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam “basin knows even better than i that i’m telling the truth” replied the duchess “but he thinks he’s obliged to look severe because you are present ma’am and he’s afraid of my shocking you” “oh please no i beg of you” cried the princesse de parme dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious fridays at the duchesse de guermantes’s this forbidden fruit which the queen of sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste “why it was basin himself that she told when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression ‘but the queen is in mourning for whom pray is it a great grief to your majesty’—‘no it’s not a deep mourning it’s a light mourning quite a light mourning it’s my sister’ the truth is she’s delighted about it as basin knows perfectly well she invited us to a party that very evening and gave me two pearls i wish she could lose a sister every day so far from weeping for her sister’s death she was in fits of laughter over it she probably says to herself like robert ‘sic transit ——’ i forget how it goes on” she added modestly knowing how it went on perfectly well

   in saying all this mme de guermantes was only being witty and with complete insincerity for the queen of naples like the duchesse d’alençon also doomed to a tragic fate had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk mme de guermantes knew those noble bavarian sisters her cousins too well not to be aware of this “he would like not to go back to morocco” said the princesse de parme alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of robert’s name which had been held out to her quite unintentionally by mme de guermantes “i believe you know general de monserfeuil” “very slightly” replied the duchess who was an intimate friend of the officer in question the princess explained what it was that saintloup wanted “good gracious yes if i see him — it is possible that i may meet him” the duchess replied so as not to appear to be refusing the occasions of her meeting general de monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything this uncertainty did not however satisfy the duke who interrupted his wife “you know perfectly well you won’t seeing him oriane and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he hasn’t done my wife has a passion for doing good turns to people” he went on growing more and more furious in order to force the princess to withdraw her request without there being any question made of his wife’s good nature and so that mme de parme should throw the blame back upon his own character which was essentially obstructive “robert could get anything he wanted out of monserfeuil only as he happens not to know himself what he wants he gets us to ask for it because he knows there’s no better way of making the whole thing fall through oriane has asked too many favours of monserfeuil a request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse” “oh in that case it would be better if the duchess did nothing” said mme de parme

    “obviously” the duke closed the discussion “poor general he’s been defeated again at the elections” said the princess so as to turn the conversation from robert “oh it’s nothing serious it’s only the seventh time” said the duke who having been obliged himself to retire from politics quite enjoyed hearing of other people’s failures at the polls “he has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby” “what is that poor mme de monserfeuil in an interesting condition again” cried the princess

    “why of course” replied the duke “that’s the one division where the poor general has never failed to get in”

   in the period that followed i was continually to be invited were it with a small party only to these repasts at which i had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the apostles in the saintechapelle they did assemble there indeed like the early christians not to partake merely of a material nourishment which incidentally was exquisite but in a sort of social eucharist so that in the course of a few dinnerparties i assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the duke and duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list and at the same time while i sipped one of those yquems which lay concealed in the guermantes cellars i tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence however for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board the consumption of the latter was not indispensable old friends of m and mme de guermantes came in to see them after dinner ‘with the toothpicks’ as mme swann would have said without being expected and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawingroom in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside there was no record of anything else among the guermantes in these evenings in the garden but orangeade it had a sort of ritual meaning to have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition just as a big athome in the faubourg saintgermain ceases to be an athome if there is a play also or music you must be supposed to have come simply — though there be five hundred of you — to pay a call on let us say the princesse de guermantes people marvelled at my influence because i was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears i took a dislike on this account to the prince d’agrigente who was like all the people who lacking in imagination but not in covetousness take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves which meant that every time m d’agrigente by diminishing my ration spoiled my pleasure for this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench one’s thirst for it nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming blushing like an orchard in spring or it may be colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruittrees the juice lets itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop and m d’agrigente prevented me regularly from taking my fill of it despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul in these humble kinds the social communion was none the less administered in this respect doubtless the friends of m and mme de guermantes had after all as i had originally imagined remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing numbers of elderly men came to receive from the duchess together with the invariable drink a welcome that was often far from cordial now this could not have been due to snobbishness they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior nor to love of splendour they did love it perhaps but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shootingparty she was giving for a couple of days for the king of spain they had nevertheless declined her invitation and had come round without fail to inquire whether mme de guermantes was at home they were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own or sentiments of any great warmth mme de guermantes let fall now and then on the dreyfus case on the republic the laws against religion or even in an undertone on themselves their weaknesses the dullness of their conversation comments which they had to appear not to notice no doubt if they kept up their habit of coming there it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish with its familiar reassuring sappy savour free from blend or taint with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it remaining more ‘noble’ in this respect than they themselves imagined now on this occasion among the visitors to whom i was introduced after dinner it so happened that there was that general de monserfeuil of whom the princesse de parme had been speaking while mme de guermantes of whose drawingroom he was one of the regular frequenters had not known that he was going to be there that evening he bowed before me on hearing my name as though i had been the president of the supreme war council i had supposed it to be simply from some deeprooted unwillingness to oblige in which the duke as in wit if not in love was his wife’s accomplice that the duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to m de monserfeuil and i saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that i seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the princess that robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed but it was by the genuine malice of mme de guermantes that i was revolted when the princesse de parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the general the duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her “but ma’am” she cried “monserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new government you would be wasting your breath” “i think he can hear us” murmured the princess as a hint to the duchess not to speak so loud without lowering her voice “your highness need not be afraid he’s as deaf as a post” said the duchess every word reaching the general distinctly “the thing is i believe m de saintloup is in a place that is not very safe” said the princess “what is one to do” replied the duchess “he’s in the same boat as everybody else the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there besides no it’s not really dangerous if it was you can imagine how anxious i should be to help i should have spoken to saintjoseph about it during dinner he has far more influence and he’s a real worker but as you see he’s gone now still asking him would be less awkward than going to this one who has three of his sons in morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged he might raise that as an objection since your highness insists on it i shall speak to saintjoseph — if i see him again or to beautreillis but if i don’t see either of them you mustn’t waste your pity on robert it was explained to us the other day exactly where he is i’m sure he couldn’t wish for a better place”

    “what a pretty flower i’ve never seen one like it there’s no one like you oriane for having such marvellous things in your house” said the princesse de parme who fearing that general de monserfeuil might have overheard the duchess sought now to change the conversation i looked and recognised a plant of the sort that i had watched elstir painting “i am so glad you like them they are charming do look at their little purple velvet collars the only thing against them is — as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed — they have a hideous name and a horrid smell in spite of which i am very fond of them but what is rather sad is that they are dying” “but they’re growing in a pot they aren’t cut flowers” said the princess “no” answered the duchess with a smile “but it comes to the same thing as they’re all ladies it’s a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don’t both grow on the same stalk i’m like people who keep a lady dog i have to find a husband for my flowers otherwise i shan’t have any young ones” “how very strange do you mean to say that in nature   ” “yes there are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage as they do with sovereigns by proxy without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another and so i assure you i always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive but the odds are too great fancy he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house he hasn’t appeared so far i believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life but i must say a little immodesty would please me better it’s just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that’s very rare in these latitudes in his case it’s the wind that’s responsible for consummating the marriage but the wall is a trifle high” “by jove yes” said m de bréauté “you ought to take just a couple of inches off the top that will be quite enough there are certain operations one ought to know how to perform the flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening duchess comes from a plant called the vanilla tree this plant produces flowers which are both male and female but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication and so we could never get any fruit from them until a young negro a native of réunion by the name of albins which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means ‘white’ had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact” “babal you’re divine you know everything” cried the duchess “but you yourself oriane have told me things i had no idea of” the princesse de parme assured her “i must explain to your highness that it is swann who has always talked to me all about botany sometimes when we were too bored to go to a teaparty or a concert we would set off for the country and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers which was far more amusing than going to human marriages — no weddingbreakfast and no crowd in the sacristy we never had time to go very far now that motorcars have come in it would be delightful unfortunately in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage which makes everything very difficult oh ma’am life is a dreadful business we spend our whole time doing things that bore us and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting he has to make a marriage like swann’s faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person i chose the former calamity besides when it comes to that there was no need to go quite so far it seems that here in my own little bit of garden more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight — in the bois de boulogne only they attract no attention because among flowers it’s all done quite simply you see a little orange shower or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower and that does the trick” “the cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid too it’s empire i think” said the princess who not being familiar with the works of darwin and his followers was unable to grasp the point of the duchess’s pleasantries “it’s lovely isn’t it i’m so glad ma’am likes it” replied the duchess “it’s a magnificent piece i must tell you that i’ve always adored the empire style even when it wasn’t in fashion i remember at guermantes i got into terrible disgrace with my motherinlaw because i told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid empire furniture basin had inherited from the montesquious and used it to furnish the wing we lived in” m de guermantes smiled he must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different but the witticisms of the princesse des laumes at the expense of her motherinlaw’s bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the prince was in love with his wife his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former a contempt which however went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect “the iénas have the same armchair with wedgwood medallions it’s a lovely thing but i prefer my own” said the duchess with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion “i know of course that they’ve some marvellous things which i haven’t got” the princesse de parme remained silent “but it’s quite true your highness hasn’t seen their collection oh you ought really to come there one day with me it’s one of the most magnificent things in paris you’d say it was a museum come to life” and since this suggestion was one of the most ‘guermantes’ of the duchess’s audacities inasmuch as the lénas were for the princesse de parme rank usurpers their son bearing like her own the title of duc de guastalla mme de guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the princesse de parme from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement they too made an effort to smile at once frightened bewildered and above all delighted to think that they were being earwitnesses of oriane’s very ‘latest’ and could carry it away with them ‘red hot’ they were only half shocked knowing that the duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable had she not within the last few years brought together princesse mathilde and that due d’aumale who had written to the princess’s own brother the famous letter “in my family all the men are brave and the women chaste” and inasmuch as princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are the due d’aumale and princesse mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at mme de guermantes’s that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance with that faculty for forgetting the past which louis xviii shewed when he took as his minister fouché who had voted the death of his brother mme de guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between princesse murât and the queen of naples in the meantime the princesse de parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirsapparent to the thrones of the netherlands and belgium styled respectively prince of orange and duke of brabant had one offered to present to them m de mailly nesle prince d’orange and m de charlus due de brabant but before anything further could happen the duchess whom swann and m de charlus between them albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the lénas’ existence had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the empire style exclaimed “honestly ma’am i can’t tell you how beautiful you will think it i must confess that the empire style has always had a fascination for me but at the lénas’ it is really like a hallucination that sort of — what shall i say — reflux from the expedition to egypt and also the sweep forward into our own times from antiquity all those things that invade our houses the sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas the serpents coiled round candelabra a huge muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock and then all the pompeian lamps the little boatshaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the nile so that you expect to see moses climb out of them the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables    ” “they’re not very comfortable to sit in those empire chairs” the princess ventured “no” the duchess agreed “but” she at once added insisting on the point with a smile “i like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk i like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawingroom crosses his fasces and piles his laurels i can assure you that at the iénas’ one doesn’t stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a victory painted in fresco on the wall my husband is going to say that i’m a very bad royalist but i’m terribly disaffected as you know i can assure you that in those people’s house one comes to love all the big n’s and all the bees good gracious after all for a good many years under our kings we weren’t exactly surfeited with glory and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs i must say i think it’s all rather fetching your highness ought really” “why my dear if you think so” said the princess “but it seems to me that it won’t be easy” “but ma’am will find that it will all go quite smoothly they are very good people and no fools we took mme de chevreuse there” added the duchess knowing the force of this example “she was enchanted the son is really very pleasant i’m going to say something that’s not quite proper” she went on “but he has a bedroom and more especially a bed in it in which i should love to sleep — without him what is even less proper is that i went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it by his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long siren stretched out at full length a lovely thing with a motherofpearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand i assure you” went on mme de guermantes reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips drawing them out with her long expressive hands directing on the princess as she spoke a gentle steady and searching gaze “that with the palms and the golden crown at the side it was most moving it was just the arrangement of gustave moreau’s death and the young man your highness must know that great work of course” the princesse de parme who did not know so much as the painter’s name made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently in order to manifest her admiration for his picture but the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us “a goodlooking boy i believe” she asked “no for he’s just like a tapir the eyes are a little those of a queen hortense on a screen but he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a mameluke appearance you feel that the polisher must call round every morning swann” she went on reverting to the bed of the young duke “was struck by the resemblance between this siren and gustave moreau’s death but apart from that” she added her speech becoming more rapid though still serious so as to provoke more laughter “there was nothing really that could strike us for it was only a cold in the head and the young man made a marvellous recovery” “they say he’s a snob” put in m de bréauté with a malicious twinkle expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said “they tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand is that so” “g— ood g — racious n — o” replied mme de guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence “perhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance because he’s extremely young but i should be surprised to hear that he was really for he’s intelligent” she added as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence “he has wit too i’ve known him to be quite amusing” she said again laughing with the air of an epicure and expert as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker or as though the duc de guastalla’s sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke “anyway as he never goes anywhere he can’t have much field for his snobbishness” she wound up forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the princesse de parme to make overtures “i cannot help wondering what the prince de guermantes who calls her mme iéna will say if he hears that i’ve been to see her” “what” cried the duchess with extraordinary vivacity “don’t you know that it was we who gave up to gilbert” she bitterly regretted that surrender now “a complete cardroom done in the empire style which came to us from quiouquiou and is an absolute marvel there was no room for it here though i think it would look better here than it does with him it’s a thing of sheer beauty half etruscan half egyptian    ” “egyptian” queried the princess to whom the word etruscan conveyed little “well really you know a little of both swann told us that he explained it all to me only you know i’m such a dunce but then ma’am what one has to bear in mind is that the egypt of the empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical egypt nor their roman with the romans nor their etruria    ” “indeed” said the princess “no it’s like what they used to call a louis xv costume under the second empire when anna de monchy and dear brigode’s mother were girls basin was talking to you just now about beethoven we heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good though a little stiff with a russian theme in it it’s pathetic to think that he believed it to be russian in the same way as the chinese painters believed they were copying bellini besides even in the same country whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel nine hundred and ninetynine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them it takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out” “forty years” the princess cried in alarm “why yes” went on the duchess adding more and more to her words which were practically my own for i had just been expressing a similar idea to her thanks to her way of pronouncing them the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics “it’s like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess i can hardly give myself as an instance because i on the contrary have always loved any interesting production from the very start however novel it might be but really the other day i was with the grand duchess in the louvre and we happened to pass before manet’s olympia nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it it looks just like an ingres and yet heaven only knows how many spears i’ve had to break for that picture which i don’t altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody” “and is the grand duchess well” inquired the princesse de parme to whom the tsar’s aunt was infinitely more familiar than manet’s model “yes we talked about you after all” she resumed clinging to her idea “the fact of the matter is as my brotherinlaw palamède always says that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language though i admit that there’s no one it’s quite so true of as gilbert if it amuses you to go to the iénas’ you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think who is a dear innocent creature but really lives in a different world i feel myself nearer more akin to my coachman my horses even than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under philip the bold or louis the fat just fancy when he goes for a walk in the country he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way quite in a friendly spirit saying ‘get on clowns’ really i’m just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if i heard myself addressed by one of the ‘recumbents’ on the old gothic tombs it’s all very well that animated gravestone’s being my cousin he frightens me and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his middle ages apart from that i quite admit that he’s never assassinated anyone” “i’ve just been seeing him at dinner at mme de villeparisis’s” said the general but without either smiling at or endorsing the duchess’s pleasantries “was m de norpois there” asked prince von whose mind still ran on the academy of moral sciences “why yes” said the general “in fact he was talking about your emperor” “it seems the emperor william is highly intelligent but he does not care for elstir’s painting not that i’m saying this against him” said the duchess “i quite share his point of view although elstir has done a fine portrait of me you don’t know it it’s not in the least like me but it’s a remarkable piece of work he is interesting while one’s sitting to him he has made me like a little old woman it’s after the style of the regents of the hospital by hals i expect you know those sublimities to borrow my nephew’s favourite expression” the duchess turned to myself gently flapping her fan of black feathers more than erect on her chair she flung her head nobly backwards for while always a great lady she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also i said that i had been once to amsterdam and the hague but that to avoid confusing my mind as my time was limited i had left out haarlem “ah the hague what a gallery” cried m de guermantes i said to him that he had doubtless admired vermeer’s street in delft but the duke was less erudite than arrogant accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery or in the salon which he did not remember having seen “if it’s to be seen i saw it” “what you’ve been to holland and you never visited haarlem” cried the duchess “why even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place they’re an extraordinary thing to have seen those halses i don’t mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramwaycar without stopping supposing they were hung out to view in the street would open his eyes pretty wide” this utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs

   m de guermantes rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife listened to what she was saying about franz hals and thought “she rides roughshod over everything our young friend can go home and say that he’s had before his eyes a great lady of the old school in the full sense of the word the like of whom couldn’t be found anywhere today” thus i beheld the pair of them withdrawn from that name guermantes in which long ago i had imagined them leading an unimaginable life now just like other men and other women lingering only behind their contemporaries a little way and that not evenly as in so many households of the faubourg where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history she remaining still louis xv while her partner is pompously louisphilippe that mme de guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment it was now by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help almost a miracle a don john of austria an isabella d’esté situated for us in the world of names have as little communication with the great pages of history as the méséglise way had with the guermantes isabella d’esté was no doubt in reality a very minor princess similar to those who under louis xiv obtained no special place at court but seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness so that a supperparty with louis xiv would appear to us only to be rather interesting whereas with isabella d’este we should find ourselves were we to meet her gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance well after we have in studying isabella d’esté in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history established the fact that her life her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this princess for having had of mantegna’s paintings a knowledge almost equal to that hitherto despised by us and put as françoise would have said lower than the dirt of m lafenestre after having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name guermantes on descending the inner slope of the life of the duchess i felt on finding there the names familiar elsewhere of victor hugo franz hals and i regret to say vibert the same astonishment that an explorer after having taken into account to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of central america or northern africa its geographical remoteness the strangeness of its flora feels on discovering once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels inhabitants who sometimes indeed among the ruins of a roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to venus are engaged in reading mérope or alzire and similarly so remote so distinct from so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom i had known the similar culture by which mme de guermantes had made herself with no ulterior motive to gratify no ambition descend to the level of people whom she would never know had the character — meritorious almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless — of an erudition in phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor “i might have shewn you a very fine one” said mme de guermantes still speaking of hals “the finest in existence some people say which was left to me by a german cousin unfortunately it turned out to be ‘enfeoffed’ in the castle — you don’t know the expression nor i either” she added with her fondness for making jokes which made her she thought seem modern at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached “i am glad you have seen my elstirs but i must admit i should have been a great deal more glad if i could have done you the honours of my hals this ‘enfeoffed’ picture” “i know the one” said prince von “it’s the grand duke of hesse’s hals” “quite so his brother married my sister” said m de guermantes “and his mother and oriane’s were first cousins as well” “but so far as m elstir is concerned” the prince went on “i shall take the liberty of saying without having any opinion of his work which i do not know that the hatred with which the emperor pursues him ought not it seems to me to be counted against him the emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence” “yes i’ve met him at dinner twice once at my aunt sagan’s and once at my aunt radziwill’s and i must say i found him quite unusual i didn’t find him at all simple but there is something amusing about him something ‘forced’” she detached the word “like a green carnation that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which i feel would have been just as well uncreated i trust i’m not shocking you” “the emperor is a man of astounding intelligence” resumed the prince “he is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it if he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it the thing is excellent“everyone smiled “you set my mind at rest” said the duchess “i should be inclined to compare the emperor” went on the prince who not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist that is to say as though it were spelt ‘arkeologist’ never missed an opportunity of using it “to an old archaeologist” but the prince said ‘arsheologist’ “we have in berlin if you put him in front of a genuine assyrian antique he weeps but if it is a modern sham if it is not really old he does not weep and so when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old they take it to the old arsheologist if he weeps they buy the piece for the museum if his eyes remain dry they send it back to the dealer and prosecute him for fraud well every time i dine at potsdam if the emperor says to me of a play ‘prince you must see that it’s a work of genius’ i make a note not to go to it and when i hear him fulminating against an exhibition i rush to see it at the first possible opportunity” “norpois is in favour of an anglofrench understanding isn’t he” said m de guermantes “what use would that be to you” asked prince von who could not endure the english in a tone at once of irritation and cunning “the english are so schtubid i know of course that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you but one can judge them all the same by the stupidity of their generals a friend of mine was talking the other day to botha you know the boer leader he said to my friend ‘it’s terrible an army like that i rather like the english as a matter of fact but just imagine that i who am only a peasant have beaten them in every battle and in the last when i gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own while i myself surrendered because i had to i managed to take two thousand prisoners that was good enough because i was only commanding an army of farmers but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a european army one trembles to think what may happen to them’ besides you have only to see how their king whom you know as well as i do passes for a great man in england” i barely listened to these stories stories of the kind that m de norpois used to tell my father they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought and besides even had they possessed the elements which they lacked they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which i dwelt in my skin my wellbrushed hair my starched shirtfront in which that is to say i could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life “oh i don’t agree with you at all” said mme de guermantes who felt that the german prince was wanting in tact “i find king edward charming so simple and much cleverer than people think and the queen is even now the most beautiful thing i’ve ever seen in the world” “but madame la duchesse” said the prince who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence “you must admit that if the prince of wales had been an ordinary person there isn’t a club that wouldn’t have blackballed him and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him the queen is charming exceedingly sweet and limited but after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects who get the big jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves and create them baronets in return it’s like the prince of bulgaria    ” “he’s our cousin” put in the duchess “he’s a clever fellow” “he’s mine too but we don’t think him a good fellow on that account no it is us you ought to make friends with it’s the emperor’s dearest wish but he insists on its coming from the heart he says ‘what i want to see is a hand clasped in mine not waving a hat in the air’ with that you would be invincible it would be more practical than the anglofrench friendship m de norpois preaches” “you know him of course” the duchess said turning to me so as not to leave me out of the conversation remembering that m de norpois had said that i had once looked as though i wanted to kiss his hand thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to mme de guermantes and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous i did not do what a man of the world would have done he would have said that he detested m de norpois and had let him see it he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate cause of the ambassador’s slanders which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals i said on the other hand that to my great regret i was afraid that m de norpois did not like me “you are quite mistaken” replied the duchess “he likes you very much indeed you can ask basin for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things he certainly doesn’t he will tell you that we have never heard norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you and only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the ministry as he knew that you were not very strong and couldn’t accept it he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father for whom he has an unbounded admiration” m de norpois was quite the last person whom i should have expected to do me any practical service the truth was that his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit those people who had let themselves be taken in as i had by his outward appearance of a saint louis delivering justice beneath an oaktree by the sounds easily modulated to pity that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech these slanders were frequent enough with him but that did not prevent him from feeling attractions from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them “not that i’m in the least surprised at his appreciating you” said mme de guermantes “he’s an intelligent man and i can quite understand” she added for the benefit of the rest of the party making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which i had heard nothing “that my aunt who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife especially as i understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else boaznorpois can say in the words of victor hugo

           voilà longtemps que celle avec qui j’ai dormi
           o seigneur a quitté ma couche pour la vôtre

   really my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the academy and in the end start a little academy of their own or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion they should either keep their frocks or not stick to their profession and who knows” went on the duchess with a meditative air “it may be in preparation for her widowhood there’s nothing sadder than the weeds one’s not entitled to wear” “ah if mme de villeparisis were to become mme de norpois i really believe our cousin gilbert would take to his bed” said general de monserfeuil “the prince de guermantes is a charming man but he is really very much taken up with questions of birth and manners” said the princesse de parme “i went down to spend a few days with them in the country when the princess unfortunately was ill in bed i was accompanied by petite” this was a nickname that was given to mme d’hunolstein because she was enormously stout “the prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps and pretended not to see petite we went up to the first floor to the door into the reception rooms and then stepping back to make way for me he said ‘oh how d’ye do mme d’hunolstein’ he always calls her that now since her separation pretending to have caught sight of petite for the first time so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps” “that doesn’t surprise me in the least i don’t need to tell you” said the duke who regarded himself as extremely modern more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth and in fact a republican “that i have not many ideas in common with my cousin ma’am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night but i must say that if my aunt were to marry norpois for once i should be of gilbert’s opinion to be the daughter of florimond de guise and then to make a marriage like that would be enough as the saying is to make a cat laugh what more can i say” these last words which the duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence were here quite superfluous but he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere they were for him among other things almost a question of prosody “remember though” he added “that the norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place of a good stock”

    “listen to me basin it’s really not worth your while to poke fun at gilbert if you’re going to speak the same language as he does” said mme de guermantes for whom the ‘goodness’ of a family no less than that of a wine consisted in its age but less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the guermantes spirit and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions “but aren’t you some sort of cousins” asked general de monserfeuil “i seem to remember that norpois married a la rochefoucauld” “not in that way at all she belonged to the branch of the ducs de la rochefoucauld my grandmother came from the ducs de doudeauville she was own grandmother to edouard coco the wisest man in the family” replied the duke whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial “and the two branches haven’t intermarried since louis xiv’s time the connexion would be rather distant”

    “i say that’s interesting i never knew that” said the general “however” went on m de guermantes “his mother i believe was the sister of the duc de montmorency and had originally been married to a la tour d’auvergne but as those montmorencys are barely montmorencys while those la tour d’auvergnes are not la tour d’auvergnes at all i cannot see that it gives him any very great position he says — and this should be more to the point — that he’s descended from saintrailles and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent    ”

   there was at combray a rue de saintrailles to which i had never given another thought it led from the rue de la bretonnerie to the rue de l’oiseau and as saintrailles the companion of joan of arc had by marrying a guermantes brought into that family the county of combray his arms were quartered with those of guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in sainthilaire i saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name guermantes in the forgotten tone in which i used to hear it long ago so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom i was dining this evening if the name duchesse de guermantes was for me a collective name it was so not merely in history by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it but also in the course of my own short life which had already seen in this single duchesse de guermantes so many different women superimpose themselves each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful we have not room enough in our mental field to keep the dead there as well as the living we are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation such as the name saintrailles had just wrought in my mind i felt that it would be useless to explain all this and indeed a little while earlier i had lied by implication in not answering when m de guermantes said to me “you don’t know our old wheedler” perhaps he was quite well aware that i did know him and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question

   mme de guermantes drew me out of my meditation “really i find all that sort of thing too deadly listen it’s not always as boring as this at my parties i hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation with no pedigrees next time” she murmured incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which i could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium filled with plants of another day

   what mme de guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end — for the duke and the general went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping — saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment how could i have felt otherwise until now each of my fellowguests at dinner smothering the mysterious name under which i had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people i knew had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the danish port of elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of hamlet no doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces their intellects and their prejudices but survived in them only as does the cause in the effect that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination

   and these oldtime prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of m and mme de guermantes their vanished poetry assuredly the motions in the possession of nobles which make of them the scholars the etymologists of the language not of words but of names and this moreover relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the liturgy than a freethinker on the other hand an anticlerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latter’s own church those notions if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth that is to say to the spirit had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth they knew perhaps better than myself that the duchesse de guise was princess of cleves of orleans and of porcien and all the rest but they had known long before they knew all these names the face of the duchesse de guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them i had begun with the fairy — were she fated shortly to perish — they with the woman

   in middleclass families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder so the aristocratic world courvoisiers especially but guermantes also reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities by a system of child’splay which i had me’ originally and this gave it for me its sole charm in books is it not just as though tallemant des réaux were speaking of the guermantes and not of the rohans when he relates with evident satisfaction how m de guéménée cried to his brother “you can come in here this is not the louvre” and said of the chevalier de rohan because he was a natural son of the duc de clermont “at any rate he’s a prince” the only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming hereditary grand duke of luxembourg found as much credence in this drawingroom as they had among saintloup’s friends plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone people repeated the same old stories or enriched them with others equally untrue i gathered that the princesse de luxembourg herself while apparently defending her nephew supplied weapons for the assault “you are wrong to stand up for him” m de guermantes told me as saintloup had told me before “why without taking into consideration the opinion of our family who are unanimous about him you have only to talk to his servants and they after all are the people who know him best m de luxembourg gave his little negro page to his nephew the negro came back in tears ‘grand duke beaten me me no bad boy grand duke naughty man’ it’s really too much and i can speak with some knowledge he’s oriane’s cousin” i cannot by the way say how many times in the course of this evening i heard the word ‘cousin’ used on the one hand m de guermantes almost at every name that was mentioned exclaimed “but he’s oriane’s cousin” with the sudden joy of a man who lost in a forest reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate and followed by quite a low number of kilometres the words “belvédère casimirperier” and “croix du grandveneur” and gathers from them that he is on the right road on the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion which was here the exception to the prevailing rule by the turkish ambassadress who had come in after dinner devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge she would pick up with equal facility the story of the retreat of the ten thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds it would have been impossible to ‘stump’ her on any of the most recent german publications whether they dealt with political economy mental aberrations the various forms of onanism or the philosophy of epicurus she was incidentally a dangerous person to listen to for perpetually in error she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable

   she was at this period little received in society she had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance such as the duchesse de guermantes but as a general rule had confined herself of necessity in the noblest families to obscure scions whom the guermantes had ceased to know she hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the littleknown people who were her friends at once m de guermantes thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallyingcry “but he’s oriane’s cousin i know him as well as i know my own name he lives in the rue vaneau his mother was mlle d’uzés” the ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game she tried to connect her friends with those of m de guermantes by cutting across his track “i know quite well who’ you mean no it’s not those ones they’re cousins” but this crosscurrent launched by the unfortunate ambassadress ran but a little way for m de guermantes losing interest answered “oh then i don’t know who’ you’re talking about” the ambassadress offered no reply for if she never knew anyone nearer than the ‘cousins’ of those whom she ought to have known in person very often these ‘cousins’ were not even related at all then from the lips of m de guermantes would flow a fresh wave of “but she’s oriane’s cousin” words which seemed to have for the duke the same practical value as certain epithets convenient to the roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters at least the explosion of “but she’s oriane’s cousin” appeared to me quite natural when applied to the princesse de guermantes who was indeed very closely related to the duchess the ambassadress did not seem to care for this princess she said to me in an undertone “she is stupid no she is not so beautiful as all that that claim is usurped anyhow” she went on with an air at once reflective rejecting and decided “i find her most uncongenial” but often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this mme de guermantes making it a point of honour to address as ‘aunt’ ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to louis xv just as whenever the ‘hardness’ of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose greatgreatgrandfather had espoused as had oriane’s also a daughter of louvois one of the chief joys of the fair american was to be able after a first visit to the hôtel de guermantes where she was incidentally more or less coldly received and hotly crossexamined to say ‘aunt’ to mme de guermantes who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile but little did it concern me what birth meant for m de guermantes and m de monserfeuil in the conversations which they held on the subject i sought only for a poetic pleasure without being conscious of it themselves they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally i proceeded to extract from them

   sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact of a date that a name reminded me hearing m de guermantes recall that m de bréauté‘s mother had been a choiseul and his grandmother a lucinge i fancied i could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs bleeding still in two globes of crystal those august relics the hearts of mme de praslin and of the duc de berri others were more voluptuous the fine and flowing hair of mme de tallien or mme de sabran

   better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been m de guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures authentic indifferent and majestic which taken as a whole look remarkably well the prince d’agrigente having asked why prince von had said in speaking of the due d’aumale ‘my uncle’ m de guermantes had replied “because his mother’s brother the duke of wurttemberg married a daughter of louisphilippe” at once i was lost in contemplation of a casket such as carpaccio or memling used to paint from its first panel in which the princess at the wedding festivities of her brother the duc d’orléans appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return emptyhanded of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the prince of syracuse down to the last in which she had just given birth to a son the duke of württemberg the first cousin of the prince whom i had met at dinner in that castle called fantaisie one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families they moreover outlasting a single generation of men see attached to themselves more than one historical personage in this one especially survive side by side memories of the margravine of bayreuth of this other somewhat fantastic princess the duc d’orléans’s sister to whom it was said that the name of her husband’s castle made a distinct appeal of the king of bavaria and finally of prince von to whom it was simply his own postal address at which he had just asked the duc de guermantes to write to him for he had succeeded to it and let it only during the wagner festivals to the prince de polignac another delightful ‘fantasist’ when m de guermantes to explain how he was related to mme d’arpajon was obliged going so far and so simply to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to marielouise or colbert it was still the same thing in each case a great historical event appeared only in passing masked unnatural reduced in the name of a property in the christian names of a woman so selected because she was the granddaughter of louisphilippe and marieamélie considered no longer as king and queen of the french but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage we see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of balzac where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the comédie humaine napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to rastignac and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of cinqcygne similarly the aristocracy in its heavy structure pierced with rare windows admitting a scanty daylight shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age embodies all our history immures it beetles over it

   thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order in composing themselves with relation to one another in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them

   m de luxembourg’s name having come up again in the course of the conversation the turkish ambassadress told us how the young bride’s grandfather he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals having invited m de luxembourg to luncheon the latter had written to decline putting on the envelope “m soandso miller” to which the grandfather had replied “i am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come my dear friend because i should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately for we were quite an intimate party just ourselves and there would have been only the miller his son and you” this story was not merely utterly distasteful to me who knew the impossibility of my dear m de nassau’s writing to the grandfather of his wife whose fortune moreover he was expecting to inherit and addressing him as ‘miller’ but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start the word ‘miller’ having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of la fontaine’s fable but there is in the faubourg saintgermain a silliness so great when it is aggravated by malice that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man had shewn a prettier wit than his grandsoninlaw the duc de châtellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that i had heard in the café “everyone had to lie down”— but scarcely had he begun or reported m de luxembourg’s pretension that in his wife’s presence m de guermantes ought to stand up when the duchess stopped him with the protest “no he is very absurd but not as bad as that” i was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of m de luxembourg were equally untrue and that whenever i found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators i should hear the same contradiction i asked myself nevertheless whether the contradiction just uttered by mme de guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by selfesteem in either event the latter quality succumbed to malice for she went on with a laugh “not that i haven’t had my little fling at him too for he invited me to luncheon wishing to make me know the grand duchess of luxembourg which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he’s writing to his aunt i sent a reply expressing my regret and adding as for the ‘grand duchess of luxembourg’ in inverted commas tell her that if she is coming to see me i am at home every thursday after five i have even had another little fling happening to be at luxembourg i telephoned asking him to ring me up his highness was going to luncheon had just risen from luncheon two hours went by and nothing happened so then i employed another method ‘will you tell the comte de nassau to come and speak to me’ cut to the quick he was at the instrument that very minute” everyone laughed at the duchess’s story and at other analogous that is to say i am convinced of it equally untrue stories for a man more intelligent better more refined in a word more exquisite than this luxembourgnassau i have never met the sequel will shew that it was i who was in the right i must admit that in the midst of her onslaught mme de guermantes had still a kind word for him “he was not always like that” she informed us “before he went off his head like the man in the storybook who thinks he’s become king he was no fool and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way as something he could never have dreamed of ‘it’s just like a fairytale i shall have to make my entry into luxembourg in a fairy coach’ he said to his uncle d’ornessan who answered — for you know it’s not a very big place luxembourg ‘a fairy coach i’m afraid my dear fellow you’d never get it in i should suggest that you take a goat carriage’ not only did this not annoy nassau but he was the first to tell us the story and to laugh at it” “ornessan is a witty fellow and he’s every rea — son to be his mother was a montjeu lie’s in a very bad way now poor ornessan” this name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever in fact m de guermantes had to explain that m d’ornessan’s greatgrandmother had been the sister of marie de castille montjeu the wife of timoléon de lorraine and consequently oriane’s aunt with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies while the idiot of a turkish ambassadress breathed in my ear “you appear to be very much in the duke’s good books have a care” and on my demanding an explanation “i mean to say you understand what i mean he’s a man to whom one could safely entrust one’s daughter but not one’s son” now if ever on the contrary a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women it was certainly the duc de guermantes the state of error the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth were for the ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move “his brother mémé who is as it happens for other reasons altogether” he did not bow to her “profoundly uncongenial to me is genuinely distressed by the duke’s morals so is their aunt villeparisis ah now her i adore there is a saint of a woman for you the true type of the great ladies of the past it’s not only her actual virtue that’s so wonderful but her restraint she still says ‘monsieur’ to the ambassador norpois whom she sees every day and who by the way left an excellent impression behind him in turkey”

   i did not even reply to the ambassadress in order to listen to the genealogies they were not all of them important there came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances which m de guermantes informed me was a misalliance but not without charm for uniting under the july monarchy the duc de guermantes and the duc de fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator it gave the two duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middleclass ‘louisphilippically’ indian or else under louis xiv a norpois had married the daughter of the duc de mortenart whose illustrious title struck in the remoteness of that epoch the name — which i had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern — of norpois carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal and in these cases moreover it was not only the less wellknown name that benefited by the association the other grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black the sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which i should have supposed them to be remote was due not to my ignorance alone the countrydances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title being always attached to a piece of land used to follow it from one family to another so much so that for example in the fine feudal structure that is the title of duc de nemours or duc de chevreuse i was able to discover successively hidden as in the hospitable abode of a hermitcrab a guise a prince of savoy an orléans a luynes sometimes several remained in competition for a single shell for the principality of orange the royal house of the netherlands and mm de maillynesle for the duchy of brabant the baron de charlus and the royal house of belgium various others for the titles of prince of naples duke of parma duke of reggio sometimes it was the other way the shell had been so’ long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent the name of a family and so when m de guermantes replied to a question put to him by m de monserfeuil “no my cousin was a fanatical royalist she was the daughter of the marquis de féterne who played a certain part in the chouan rising” on seeing this name féterne which had been for me since my stay at balbec the name of a country house become what i had never dreamed that it could possibly be a family name i felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairytale where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women in this sense of the words we may say that history even mere family history gives life to the old stones of a house there have been in parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit who were equally well born as the duc de guermantes or the duc de la trémoïlle they have now fallen into oblivion because as they left no descendants their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown at most the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person it survives in some country house some remote village the day is not distant when the traveller who in the heart of burgundy stops in the little village of charlus to look at its church if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones will go away ignorant that this name charlus was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land this thought reminded me that it was time to go and that while i was listening to m de guermantes talking pedigrees the hour was approaching at which i had promised to call upon his brother “who knows” i continued to muse “whether one day guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a placename save to the archaeologists who stopping by chance at combray and standing beneath the window of gilbert the bad have the patience to listen to the account given them by theodore’s successor or to read the cure’s guide” but so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it and there can be no doubt that to a certain extent the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can starting from today follow their ascending course step by step to a point far beyond the fourteenth century recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of m de charlus of the prince d’agrigente of the princesse de parme in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middleclass family and in which we make out in the luminous backward projection of a name the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics certain vices the disorders of one or another guermantes almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents whether these be anterior to the princess palatine and mme de motteville or subsequent to the prince de ligne

   however my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure the names cited had the effect of disincarnating the duchess’s guests whom for all they might call themselves prince d’agrigente or de cystira their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals so much so that i had made my landing on the ducal doormat not as upon the threshold as i had supposed but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names the prince d’agrigente himself as soon as i heard that his mother had been a damas a granddaughter of the duke of modena was delivered as from an unstable chemical alloy from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him and went to form with damas and modena which themselves were only titles a combination infinitely more seductive each name displaced by the attractions of another with which i had never suspected it of having any affinity left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain where familiarity had dulled it and speeding to join the mortemarts the stuarts or the bourbons traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an everchanging colour the name guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names — extinct and so all the more glowingly rekindled — with which i learned only now that it was connected a new sense and purpose purely poetical at the most at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem i could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess like the sire of henri iv or the duchesse de longueville but as these faces different in this respect from those of the party around me were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity they remained in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals each of a different hue detached themselves from the genealogical tree of guermantes and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds — pellucid alternate manycoloured — which like in the old jesse windows the ancestors of jesus blossomed on either side of the tree of glass

   already i had made several attempts to slip away on account more than for any other reason of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering albeit it was one of those which i had long imagined as being so beautiful — as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present at least my departure would permit the other guests once the profane intruder was no longer among them to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave they would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together for it could obviously not have been to talk of franz hals or of avarice and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middleclass society they uttered nothing but trivialities doubtless because i was in the room and i felt with some compunction on seeing all these pretty women kept apart that i was preventing them by my presence from carrying on in the most precious of its drawingrooms the mysterious life of the faubourg saintgermain but this departure which i was trying at every moment to effect m and mme de guermantes carried the spirit of selfsacrifice so far as to postpone by keeping me in the room a more curious thing still several of the ladies who had come hurrying delighted beautifully dressed with constellations of jewels to be present at a party which through my fault only differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the faubourg saintgermain any more than one feels oneself at balbec to be in a town that differs from what one’s eyes are accustomed to see — several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed as they had every reason to be but thanking mme de guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent as though on the other days those on which i was not present nothing more used to occur

   was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middleclass women into their so exclusive drawingrooms — for dinners such as this the same had i been absent the suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment but it was too absurd plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside and then if i had adopted it what would have been left of the name guermantes already so degraded since combray

   it struck me that these flowermaidens were to a strange extent either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them for more than one of them to whom i had not uttered during the whole course of the evening more than two or three casual remarks the stupidity of which had left me blushing made a point before leaving the drawingroom of coming to tell me fastening on me her fine caressing eyes straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance and to speak to me — a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner — of her desire to ‘arrange something’ after she had ‘fixed a day’ with mme de guermantes none of these flower ladies left the room before the princesse de parme the presence of that lady — one must never depart before royalty — was one of the two reasons neither of which i had guessed for which the duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining as soon as mme de parme had risen it was like a deliverance each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the princess who raised her up from the ground they received from her in a kiss and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages with the result that there followed at the front door a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the history of france the princesse de parme had forbidden mme de guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold and the duke had added “there oriane since ma’am gives you leave remember what the doctor told you”

    “i am sure the princesse de parme was most pleased to take dinner with you” i knew the formula the duke had come the whole way across the drawingroom in order to utter it before me with an obliging concerned air as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits and i guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life like one of those honorific and easy posts which even when paralytic one is still allowed to retain

   just as i was about to leave the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawingroom having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations sent up from guermantes which the duchess had presented to mme de parme the lady in waiting was somewhat flushed one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding for the princess so kind to everyone else could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant and so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed “the princess says i’m keeping her waiting she wants to be gone and to have the carnations as well good lord i’m not a little bird i can’t be in two places at once”

   alas the rule of not leaving before royalty was not the only one i could not depart at once for there was another this was that the famous lavishness unknown to the courvoisiers with which the guermantes whether opulent or practically ruined excelled in entertaining their friends was not only a material lavishness of the kind that i had often experienced with robert de saintloup but also a lavish display of charming words of courteous actions a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasurehouse within but as this last in the inactivity of fashionable existence must remain unemployed it expanded at times sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion all the more intense which might in mme de guermantes have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself which she did for that matter feel at the moment when she let it overflow for she found then in the society of the friend man or woman with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication in no way sensual similar to that which music produces in certain people she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice or a medallion and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure the fleeting emotion similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret as for the friend it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard tendered by these women who because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment make of it with a delicacy a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily a few days later to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those ‘musical moments’ which are so brief

   in the hall where i asked a footman for my snowboots which i had brought as a precaution against the snow several flakes of which had already fallen to be converted rapidly into slush not having realised that they were hardly fashionable i felt at the contemptuous smile on all sides a shame which rose to its highest pitch when i saw that mme de parme had not gone and was watching me put on my american ‘rubbers’ the princess came towards me “oh what a good idea” she exclaimed “it’s so practical there’s a sensible man for you madame we shall have to get a pair of those” she went on to her lady in waiting while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where i had managed to find these marvels “with those on you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go you’re independent of the weather” said the princess to me “oh if it comes to that your royal highness can be reassured” broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air “it will not snow again” “what do you know about it madame” came witheringly from the excellent princesse de parme who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting “i can assure your royal highness it cannot snow again it is a physical impossibility” “but why” “it cannot snow any more they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it they have put down salt in the streets” the simpleminded lady did not observe either the anger of the princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with admiral jurien de la gravière “not that it matters after all this gentleman must have stout sealegs what’s bred in the bone”

   then having escorted the princesse de parme to her carriage m de guermantes said to me taking hold of my greatcoat “let me help you into your skin” he had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason because of the guermantes affectation of simplicity become aristocratic

   an exaltation that sank only into melancholy because it was artificial was what i also although quite differently from mme de guermantes felt once i had finally left her house in the carriage that was taking me to that of m de charlus we can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves emanates from our deepest impressions the other comes to us from without the first carries with it naturally a joy the joy that springs from the life of the creator the other current that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred is not accompanied by pleasure but we can add a pleasure to it by the shock of reaction in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom into melancholy whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide well in the carriage which was taking me to m de charlus i was a prey to this second sort of exaltation widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression such as i had received in other carriages once at combray in dr percepied’s gig from which i had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of martinville another day at balbec in mme de villeparisis’s barouche when i strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees but in this third carriage what i had before my mind’s eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at mme de guermante’s dinnertable for example prince von’s stories about the german emperor general botha and the british army i had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which once we are no longer ourselves once endowed with the spirit of society we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people we cast into relief what they have said and done like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him i marvelled at my good fortune a good fortune not realised by me it is true at the actual moment in having dined with a person who knew william ii so well and had told stories about him that were — upon my word — really witty and as i repeated to myself with the prince’s german accent the story of general botha i laughed out loud as though this laugh like certain kinds of applause which increase one’s inward admiration were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element through the magnifying lenses even those of mme de guermantes’s pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid as for example that on the hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramwaycar took on a life a depth that were extraordinary and i must say that even if this exaltation was quick to subside it was not altogether unreasonable just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love to whom he can introduce us and thus offers us both utility and gratification attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking so there is no conversation any more than there are personal relations from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit what mme de guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see even from a tramwaycar was untrue but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on

   similarly the lines of victor hugo which i had heard her quote were it must be admitted of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man in which he brought to light in the order of evolution a literary species till then unknown endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence in these first poems victor hugo is still a thinker instead of contenting himself like nature with supplying food for thought his ‘thoughts’ he at that time expressed in the most direct form almost in the sense in which the duke employed the word when feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at guermantes should in the visitors’ book append to their signatures a philosophicopoetical reflexion he used to warn novices in an appealing tone “your name my dear fellow but no ‘thoughts’ please” well it was these ‘thoughts’ of victor hugo almost as entirely absent from the légende des siècles as ‘airs’ as ‘melodies’ are from wagner’s later manner that mme de guermantes admired in the early hugo nor was she altogether wrong they were touching and already round about them without their form’s having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a corneille for example lines in which a romanticism that is intermittent restrained and so all the more moving nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent and so i had been wrong in confining myself hitherto to the later volumes of hugo of the earlier of course it was only a fractional part that mme de guermantes used to embellish her conversation but simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold the lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than fortyeight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the orientales and the chants du crépuscule i cursed franchise’s footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the feuilles d’automne and sent him off with not a moment to be lost to procure me another i read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when i suddenly came across awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them the lines that i had heard mme de guermantes quote for all these reasons conversations with the duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house out of date incomplete incapable of forming a mind lacking in almost everything that we value but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great we are then by having found balzac’s preface to the chartreuse or some unpublished letters of joubert tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there the sterile frivolity of which for this windfall of a single evening we forget

   from this point of view if the fashionable world had been unable at the first moment to provide what my imagination expected and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land houses as people used to live in them long ago old customs everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives his mother his uncles his greataunts keep him in touch when he recalls his childhood with the conditions of a life almost unknown today in the deathchamber of a contemporary corpse mme de guermantes would not have pointed out but would immediately have perceived all the lapses from the traditional customs she was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women as for the pall the use of which bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals m de guermantes could remember the time when as a child he had seen it borne at the wedding of m de maillynesle while saintloup had sold his priceless ‘genealogical tree’ old portraits of the bouillons letters of louis xiii in order to buy carrières and furniture in the modern style m and mme de guermantes moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part and which left them themselves more insignificant than before had kept their marvellous boule furniture which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist a literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation which would have been for him — for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company — a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten saintjoseph cravats children dedicated to the blue and so forth which one finds today only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past the pleasure that a writer more than among other writers feels among them is not without danger for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves of his transferring them bodily into his work stillborn in that case exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion “it is attractive because it’s true that is how people do talk” these aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm with mme de guermantes of being couched in excellent french for this reason they made permissible on the duchess’s part her hilarity at the words ‘viaticum’ ‘cosmic’ ‘pythian’ ‘preeminent’ which saintloup used to employ — as similarly at his bing furniture

   when all was said very different in this respect from what i had been able to feel before the hawthorns or when i tasted a crumb of madeleine the stories that i had heard at mme de guermantes’s remained alien to me entering for a moment into me who was only physically possessed by them one would have said that being of a social not an individual nature they were impatient to escape i writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle i looked forward to another dinnerparty at which i might myself become a sort of prince von to mme de guermantes and repeat them in the meantime they made my lips quiver as i stammered them to myself and i tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force and so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where for that matter i atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud that i rang the bell at m de charlus’s door and it was in long monologues with myself in which i rehearsed everything that i was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me that i spent the whole of the time during which i was kept waiting in a drawingroom into which a footman shewed me and where i was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained i felt so urgent a need that m de charlus should listen to the stories which i was burning to tell him that i was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed and that i might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words i had just noticed in fact that i had been twentyfive minutes — that they had perhaps forgotten about me — in this room of which despite this long wait i could at the most have said that it was very big greenish in colour and contained a large number of portraits the need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state i was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one and if i found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out when just as i had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor a manservant came in with a troubled expression “monsieur le baron has been engaged all evening sir” he told me “there are still several people waiting to see him i am doing everything i possibly can to get him to receive you i have already telephoned up twice to the secretary” “no please don’t bother i had an appointment with m le baron but it is very late already and if he is busy this evening i can come back another day” “oh no sir you must not go away” cried the servant “m le baron might be vexed i will try again” i was reminded of the things i had heard about m de charlus’s servants and their devotion to their master one could not quite say of him as of the prince de conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the minister but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night when his bodyservants assembled round him at a respectful distance after running his eye over them he said “coignet the candlestick” or “ducret the nightshirt” it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw jealous of him who had been singled out by his master’s favour two of them indeed who could not abide one another used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the baron if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt if he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty still more if in winter in the garden knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold he said to him after ten minutes “put your cap on” the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him i waited ten minutes more and then after requesting me not to stay too long as m le baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before they admitted me to his presence this setting with which m de charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother guermantes but already the door stood open i could see the baron in a chinese dressinggown with his throat bare lying upon a sofa my eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat its nap flashing like a mirror which had been left on a chair with a cape as though the baron had but recently come in the valet withdrew i supposed that m de charlus would rise to greet me without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes i went towards him i said good evening he did not hold out his hand made no reply did not ask me to take a chair after a moment’s silence i asked him as one would ask an illmannered doctor whether it was necessary for me to remain standing i said this without any evil intention but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on m de charlus’s face i was not aware as it happened that at home in the country at the château de charlus he was in the habit after dinner so much did he love to play the king of sprawling in an armchair in the smokingroom letting hi3 guests remain standing round him he would ask for a light from one offer a cigar to another and then after a few minutes’ interval would say “but argencourt why don’t you sit down take a chair my dear fellow” and so forth having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated “put yourself in the louis xiv seat” he answered me with an imperious air as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated i took an armchair which was comparatively near “ah so that is what you call a louis xiv seat is it i can see you have been well educated” he cried in derision i was so much taken aback that i did not move either to leave the house as i ought to have done or to change my seat as he wished “sir” he next said to me weighing each of his words to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants “the interview which i have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless will mark the final point in our relations i shall not conceal from you that i had hoped for better things i should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little which one ought not to do even with people who are ignorant of their value simply out of the respect due to oneself were i to tell you that i had felt a certain attraction towards you i think however that benevolence in its most actively protecting sense would exceed neither what i felt nor what i was proposing to display i had immediately on my return to paris given you to understand while you were still at balbec that you could count upon me” i who remembered with what a torrent of abuse m de charlus had parted from me at balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction “what” he cried with fury and indeed his face convulsed and white differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam “do you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message — almost a declaration — that you were to remember me what was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that i sent you” “some very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments” i told him “ah” he replied with an air of scorn “these young frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land what would be said of a young berliner who had never heard of the walküre besides you must have eyes to see and see not since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure i can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles don’t protest that you know about styles” he cried in a shrill scream of rage “you can’t even tell me what you are sitting on you offer your hindquarters a directorychauffeuse as a louis xiv bergère one of these days you’ll be mistaking mme de villeparisis’s knees for the seat of the rear and a fine mess you’ll make of things then it’s precisely the same you didn’t even recognise on the binding of bergotte’s book the lintel of myosotis over the door of balbec church could there be any clearer way of saying to you ‘forget me not’” i looked at m de charlus undoubtedly his magnificent head though repellent yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives you would have called him an apollo grown old but an olivehued bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth as for intellect one could not deny that his over a vast compass had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother guermantes but whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds one felt that even if there was now an offended pride now a disappointment in love or a rancour or sadism a love of teasing a fixed obsession this man was capable of doing murder and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother his sisterinlaw or any of the rest “just as in velazquez’slances” he went on “the victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank as is the duty of every noble nature since i was everything and you were nothing it was i who took the first steps towards you you have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness but i have not allowed myself to be discouraged our religion inculcates patience the patience i have shewn towards you will be counted i hope to my credit and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits but after all sir all this is now neither here nor there i have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares i could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few but at least and this is the conclusion which i am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth at least i intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications” so far i had never dreamed that m de charlus’s rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him i searched my memory i had not spoken about him to anyone some evildoer had invented the whole thing i protested tom de charlus that i had said absolutely nothing about him “i don’t think i can have annoyed you by saying to mme de guermantes that i was a friend of yours” he gave a disdainful smile made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register and there without strain attacking the shrillest and most insolent note “oh sir” he said returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale “i think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends i do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of chippendale for a rococo chaire but really i do not believe” he went on with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile “i do not believe that you can ever have said or thought that we were frlends as for your having boasted that you had been presented to me had talked to me knew me slightly had obtained almost without solicitation the prospect of coming one day under my protection i find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so the extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation those talks that vague prospect of future relations were for you it is not for me to say an honour but still when all is said and done an advantage as to which i consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it i will go so far as to say” he went on passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that i expected him to burst into tears “that when you left unanswered the proposal i made to you here in paris it seemed to me so unheardof an act on your part coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family” on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence “that i was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen letters miscarrying addresses copied down wrong i can see that on my part it was great foolishness but saint bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying anyhow that is all finished now the idea did not attract you there is no more to be said it seems to me only that you might have brought yourself” and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice “were it only out of consideration for my age to write to me i had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things which i had taken good care not to tell you you have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were that is your affair but as i tell you one can always write in your place and indeed in my own i should have done so i like my place for that reason better than yours — i say ‘for that reason’ because i believe that we are all equal and i have more fellowfeeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes but i can say that i prefer my place to yours because what you have done in the whole course of my life which is beginning now to be a pretty long one i am conscious that i have never done” his head was turned away from the light and i could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as i might have supposed from his voice “i told you that i had taken a hundred steps towards you the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me now it is for me to withdraw and we shall know one another no longer i shall retain not your name but your story so that at moments when i might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts good manners or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them i may remember that that is ranking them too highly no that you should have said that you knew me when it was true — for henceforward it ceases to be true — i regard that as only natural and i take it as an act of homage that is to say something pleasant unfortunately elsewhere and in other circumstances you have uttered remarks of a very different nature” “sir i swear to you that i have said nothing that could insult you” “and who says that i am insulted” he cried with fury flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless while as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face his voice became alternately shrill and grave like the deafening onrush of a storm the force with which he habitually spoke which used to make strangers turn round in the street was multiplied an hundredfold as is a musical forte if instead of being played on the piano it is played by an orchestra and changed into afortissimo as well m de charlus roared “do you suppose that it is within your power to insult me you evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type heaped one upon another would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes” a moment before this my desire to persuade m de charlus that i had never said nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage caused by the words which were dictated to him solely to my mind by his colossal pride perhaps they were indeed the effect in part at any rate of this pride almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which i was then still ignorant and for which i could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance i could at least failing this unknown element have mingled with his pride had i remembered the words of mme de guermantes a trace of madness but at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head there was in him according to me only pride in me there was only fury this fury at the moment when m de charlus ceased to shout in order to refer to his august toes with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers this fury could contain itself no longer with an impulsive movement i wanted to strike something and a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself and even in view of their dignity as works of art the pieces of german porcelain that were grouped around him i flung myself upon the baron’s new silk hat dashed it to the ground trampled upon it began blindly pulling it to pieces wrenched off the brim tore the crown in two without heeding the vociferations of m de charlus which continued to sound and crossing the room to leave it opened the door one on either side of it to my intense stupefaction stood two footmen who moved slowly away so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty i afterwards learned their names one was called burnier the other charmel i was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me it was highly improbable three others appeared to me to be less so one that the baron sometimes entertained guests against whom as he might happen to need assistance but why he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand the second was that drawn by curiosity they had stopped to listen at the keyhole not thinking that i should come out so quickly the third that the whole of the scene which m de charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted he had himself told them to listen from a love of the spectacular combined perhaps with a ‘nunc crudimini‘ from which each would derive a suitable profit

   my anger had not calmed that of m de charlus my departure from the room seemed to cause him acute distress he called me back made his servants call me back and finally forgetting that a moment earlier when he spoke of his ‘august toes’ he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification came running after me at full speed overtook me in the hall and stood barring the door “there now” he said “don’t be childish come back for a minute he who loveth well chasteneth well and if i have chastened you well it is because i love you well” my anger had subsided i let the word ‘chasten’ pass and followed the baron who summoning a footman ordered him without a trace of selfconsciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat which was replaced by another “if you will tell me sir who it is that has treacherously maligned me” i said to m de charlus “i will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor” “who do you not know do you retain no memory of the things you say do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy and do you imagine that i am going to betray a person to whom i have given my promise” “sir is it impossible then for you to tell me” i asked racking my brains in a final effort to discover and discovering no one to whom i could have spoken about m de charlus “you did not hear me say that i had given a promise of secrecy to my informant” he said in a snapping voice “i see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence you ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing” “sir” i replied moving away from him “you insult me i am unarmed because you are several times my age we are not equally matched on the other hand i cannot convince you i have already sworn to you that i have said nothing” “i am lying then am i” he cried in a terrifying tone and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself “some one has misinformed you” then in a gentle affectionate melancholy voice as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements in which a gracefulscherzo amiable and idyllic follows the thunderpeals of the opening pages “it is quite possible” he told me “generally speaking a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true it is your fault if not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which i had held out to you you have not furnished me by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor either way true or false the remark has done its work i can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me i cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well for i have chastened you well enough but i no longer love you” while saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell a different footman appeared “bring something to drink and order the brougham” i said that i was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting “they have probably paid him and sent him away” he told me “you needn’t worry about that i am ordering a carriage to take you home    if you’re anxious about the time    i could have given you a room here    ” i said that my mother would be uneasy “ah of course yes well true or false the remark has done its work my affection a trifle premature had flowered too soon and like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at balbec it has been unable to withstand the first frost” if m de charlus’s affection for me had not been destroyed he could hardly have acted differently since while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted he made me sit down drink asked me to stay the night and was going now to send me home he had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sisterinlaw and cousin guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer with something of the same momentary fondness for myself of the same effort to prolong the passing minute “unfortunately” he went on “i have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed my affection for you is quite dead nothing can revive it i believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that i regret it i always feel myself to be a little like victor hugo’s boaz ‘i am widowed and alone and the darkness gathers o’er me’”

   i passed again with him through the big green drawingroom i told him speaking quite at random how beautiful i thought it “ain’t it” he replied “it’s a good thing to be fond of something the woodwork is bagard what is rather charming d’you see is that it was made to match the beauvais chairs and the consoles you observe it repeats the same decorative design there used to be only two places where you could see this the louvre and m d’hinnisdal’s house but naturally as soon as i had decided to come and live in this street there cropped up an old family house of the chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me on the whole it’s good it might perhaps be better but after all it’s not bad some pretty things ain’t there these are portraits of my uncles the king of poland and the king of england by mignard but why am i telling you all this you must know it as well as i do you were waiting in this room no ah then they must have put you in the blue drawingroom” he said with an air that might have been either impertinence on the score of my want of interest or personal superiority in not having taken the trouble to ask where i had been kept waiting “look now in this cabinet i have all the hats worn by mlle elisabeth by the princesse de lamballe and by the queen they don’t interest you one would think you couldn’t see perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve if you like this kind of beauty better here is a rainbow by turner beginning to shine out between these two rembrandts as a sign of our reconciliation you hear beethoven has come to join him” and indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the pastoral symphony ‘joy after the storm’ performed somewhere not far away on the first landing no doubt by a band of musicians i innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that and who the musicians were “ah well one doesn’t know one never does know they are unseen music pretty ain’t it” he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone which nevertheless suggested somehow the influence and accent of swann “but you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples you want to go home regardless of any want of respect for beethoven or for me you are uttering your own judgment and condemnation” he added with an affectionate and mournful air when the moment had come for me to go “you will excuse my not accompanying you home as good manners ordain that i should” he said to me “since i have decided not to see you again spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me but i am tired and i have a great deal to do” and then seeing that it was a fine night “very well yes i will come in the carriage there is a superb moon which i shall go on to admire from the bois after i have taken you home what you don’t know how to shave even on a night when you’ve been dining out you have still a few hairs here” he said taking my chin between two fingers so to speak magnetised which after a moment’s resistance ran up to my ears like the fingers of a barber “ah it would be pleasant to look at the ‘blue light of the moon’ in the bois with some one like yourself” he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness then in a sadder tone “for you are nice all the same you could be nicer than anyone” he went on laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder “originally i must say that i found you quite insignificant” i ought to have reflected that he must find me so still i had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me barely half an hour before in spite of this i had the impression that he was for the moment sincere that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what i regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride the carriage was waiting beside us and still he prolonged the conversation “come along” he said abruptly “jump in in five minutes we shall be at your door and i shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations and for all time it is better since we must part for ever that we should do so as in music on a perfect chord” despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again i could have sworn that m de charlus annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings would not have been displeased to see me once again nor was i mistaken for a moment later “there now” he said “if i hadn’t forgotten the most important thing of all in memory of your grandmother i have had bound for you a curious edition of mme de sévigné that is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting one must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day just look how long they took over the congress of vienna” “but i could call for it without disturbing you” i said obligingly “will you hold your tongue you little fool” he replied with anger “and not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably i do not say certainly for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes received by me” then regaining possession of himself “i do not wish to part from you on these words no dissonance before the eternal silence of the dominant” it was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension “you would not care to come to the bois” he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative and that not as it seemed to me because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his selfesteem might meet with a refusal “oh very well” he went on still postponing our separation “it is the moment when as whistler says the bourgeois go to bed” perhaps he wished now to capture me by my selfesteem “and the right time to begin to look at things but you don’t even know who whistler was” i changed the conversation and asked him whether the princesse d’iéna was an intelligent person m de charlus stopped me and adopting the most contemptuous tone that i had yet heard him use “oh there sir” he informed me “you are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which i have no concern there is perhaps an aristocracy among the tahitians but i must confess that i know nothing about it the name which you have just mentioned strangely enough did sound in my ears only a few days ago some one asked me whether i would condescend to allow them to present to me the young duc de guastalla the request astonished me for the duc de guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me for the simple reason that he is my cousin and has known me all his life he is the son of the princesse de parme and as a young kinsman of good upbringing he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on new year’s day but on making inquiries i discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested as there exists no princess of that title i supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the pont d’iéna who had picturesquely assumed the title of princesse d’iéna just as one talks about the panther of the batignolles or the steel king but no the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which i had seen and admired at an exhibition and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine as for this selfstyled duc de guastalla he i supposed must be my secretary’s stockbroker one can procure so many things with money but no it was the emperor it appears who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give it was perhaps a sign of power or of ignorance or of malice in any case i consider it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers but really i cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter my knowledge begins and ends with the faubourg saintgermain where among all the courvoisiers and gallardons you will find if you can manage to secure an introduction plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of balzac who will amuse you naturally all that has nothing to do with the position of the princesse de guermantes but without me and my ‘open sesame’ her portals are unapproachable” “it is really very lovely isn’t it sir the princesse de guermantes’s mansion” “oh it’s not very lovely it’s the loveliest thing in the world next to the princess herself of course” “the princesse de guermantes is better than the duchesse de guermantes” “oh there’s no comparison” it is to be observed that whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination they will crown or dethrone to suit their affections or their quarrels those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed

    “the duchesse de guermantes” possibly in not calling her ‘oriane’ he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself “is delightful far superior to anything you can have guessed but after all she is incommensurable with her cousin the princess is exactly what the people in the markets might imagine princess metternich to have been but old metternich believed she had started wagner because she knew victor maurel the princesse de guermantes or rather her mother knew the man himself which is a distinction not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady and the esther gardens alone” “one can’t see them” “no you would have to be invited but they never invite anyone unless i intervene” but at once withdrawing after casting it at me the bait of this offer he held out his hand for we had reached my door “my part is played sir i will simply add these few words another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection as i have done let the present example serve for your instruction do not neglect it affection is always precious what one cannot do by oneself in this life because there are things which one cannot ask nor do nor wish nor learn by oneself one can do in company and without needing to be thirteen as in balzac’s story or four as in the three musketeers goodbye”

   he must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home at once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind but i had already given the order and so as not to lose any more time went across now to ring the bell without its entering my head that i had been meaning to tell m de charlus about the german emperor and general botha stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind

   on entering my room i saw on my desk a letter which franchise’s young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there now that my mother was away there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking i was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which without an envelope lay spread out before me and which was my sole excuse seemed to offer itself to my eye

    “dear friend and cousin

    “i hope this finds you in good health and the same with all the young folk particularly my young godson joseph whom i have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom i prefer to you all as being my godson these relics of the heart they have their dust also upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands besides dear friend and cousin who can say that tomorrow you and your dear wife my cousin marie will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea like the sailor clinging to the mast on high for this life is but a dark valley dear friend i must tell you that my principal occupation which will astonish you i am certain is now poetry which i love passionately for one must somehow pass the time away and so dear friend do not be too surprised if i have not answered your last letter before now in place of pardon let oblivion come as you are aware madame’s mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors the day of her interment was a great day for all monsieur’s relations came in crowds as well as several ministers it took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won’t do as much for mother michu so all my life to come can be but one long sob i am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which i have recently learned what would you say my dear friends if i arrived suddenly like that at full speed at les ecorces but on that head i shall no more keep silence for i feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away i am associating with the duchesse de guermantes people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages therefore it is with pleasure that i am going to send the works of racine of victor hugo of pages choisies de chenedolle of alfred de musset for i would cure the land in which i saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime i can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister rose may it never be said of her and rose she lived only as live the roses as has been said by victor hugo the sonnet of arvers alfred de musset all those great geniuses who for that cause have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like jeanne d’arc hoping for your next letter soon receive my kisses like those of a brother

    “périgot joseph”

   we are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange by a last illusion still unshattered in spite of this the mysterious utterances by means of which m de charlus had led me to imagine the princesse de guermantes as an extraordinary creature different from anyone that i knew were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which i was plunged speedily followed by the fear that i might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which i had not been invited when about two months after my dinner with the duchess and while she was at cannes having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common i read the following words engraved on a card “the princesse de guermantesnée duchesse en bavière at home the ——th” no doubt to be invited to the princesse de guermantes’s was perhaps not from the social point of view any more difficult than to dine with the duchess and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of prince is not superior to that of duke besides i told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as m de charlus made out nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society but my imagination like elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess depicted for me not what i knew but what it saw what it saw that is to say what the name shewed it now even before i had met the duchess the name guermantes preceded by the title of princess like a note or a colour or quantity profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it had already suggested to me something entirely different with that title one finds one’s thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of louis xiii and louis xiv the english court the queen of scots the duchesse d’aumale and i imagined the town house of the princesse de guermantes as more or less frequented by the duchesse de longueville and the great condé whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that i should ever make my way into it

   many of the things that m de charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at mme de guermantes’s people’s names are in this respect like the names of places had swung it towards oriane’s cousin for that matter m de charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled and this perhaps because he did nothing did not write did not paint did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner but superior by several degrees to the people in society if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation he was not for that reason understood by them speaking as an artist he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society but reveal it to artists alone with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the esquimaux this precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise but which once they have been digested by the reindeer become for the inhabitants of the far north a nourishing form of food

   to which i may add that the pictures which m de charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections hatreds directed mainly against the young men adoration aroused principally by certain women

   if among these the princesse de guermantes was placed by m de charlus upon the most exalted throne his mysterious words about the ‘unapproachable aladdin’s palace’ in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view of which i shall have to speak later in these artificial magnifications the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people and consequently a difference among them and how when it comes to that could it be otherwise the humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is for all that the same that in the memoirs in the letters of eminent persons we have seen described and have felt a desire to know the old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter which in a book on the war of 1870 we read with emotion to prince friedrichkarl we are bored at a dinnertable because our imagination is absent and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book but the people in question are the same we should like to have known mme de pompadour who was so valuable a patron of the arts and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern egerias at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call so uninteresting do we find them the fact remains nevertheless that these differences do exist people are never exactly similar to one another their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves at one might say the same level of friendship reveals differences which in the end offer compensations when i knew mme de montmorency she loved to say unpleasant things to me but if i was in need of a service she would squander in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively all the credit at her disposal without counting the cost whereas some other woman mme de guermantes for example would never have wished to hurt my feelings never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living morally of the guermantes but had i asked her for the least thing above and beyond that would not have moved an inch to procure it for me as in those country houses where one has at one’s disposal a motorcar and a special footman but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party which was for me the true friend mme de montmorency so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige or mme de guermantes distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me the types of the human mind are so varied so opposite not only in literature but in society that baudelaire and mérimée are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually these peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes of speech of actions so coherent so despotic that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest with mme de guermantes her words deduced like a theorem from her type of mind seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said and i was at heart of her opinion when she told me that mme de montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand or when having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady she said “that is what you call a good woman it is what i call a monster” but this tyranny of the reality which confronts us this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn — already distant — as pale as the faintest memory disappeared when i was away from mme de guermantes and a different lady said to me putting herself on my level and reckoning the duchess as placed far below either of us “oriane takes no interest really in anything or anybody” or even what in the presence of mme de guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite “oriane is a snob” seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert mme d’arpajon and mme de montpensier into commensurable quantities it would have been impossible for me to reply had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other

   now among the peculiar characteristics of the drawingroom of the princesse de guermantes the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness due in part to the royal birth of the princess but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the prince prejudices which incidentally the duke and duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that i should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes and at every dinnerparty made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under louis xiv a place which thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy he was the only person who knew for this reason many of the people in society placed to the credit of the duke and duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins “the duke and duchess are far more modern far more intelligent they don’t think of nothing like the other couple but how many quarterings one has their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins’” were customary remarks the memory of which made me tremble as i looked at the card of invitation to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker

   if the duke and duchess had not been still at cannes i might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which i had received was genuine this state of doubt in which i was plunged was not due as i flattered myself for a time by supposing to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which consequently a writer even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly ‘objective’ and to depict each class differently i happened in fact only the other day in a charming volume of memoirs to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the princesse de guermantes’s card made me undergo “georges and i” or “hély and i” i have not the book at hand to verify the reference “were so keen to be asked to mme delessert’s that having received an invitation from her we thought it prudent each of us independently to make certain that we were not the victims of an april fool” now the writer is none other than the comte d’haussonville he who married the duc de broglie’s daughter and the other young man who ‘independently’ makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is according to whether he is called georges or hély one or other of the two inseparable friends of m d’haussonville either m d’harcourt or the prince de chalais

   the day on which the party was to be given at the princesse de guermantes’s i learned that the duke and duchess had just returned to paris the princess’s ball would not have brought them back but one of their cousins was seriously ill and moreover the duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night and at which he himself was to appear as louis xi and his wife as isabel of bavaria and i determined to go and see her that morning but having gone out early they had not yet returned i watched first of all from a little room which had seemed to me to be a good lookout post for the arrival of their carriage as a matter of fact i had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which i could barely make out our courtyard but i did see into several others and this though of no value to me occupied my mind for a time it is not only in venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters it is just the same in paris nor do i cite venice at random it is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of paris make one think in the morning with their tall wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks the brightest reds it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it planted on top of the town the garden of a tulipfancier of delft or haarlem and then also the extreme proximity of the houses with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face barely distinguishable in the shadow of a witch thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house by suppressing all sound in its interval by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames glazed by the closing of the windows an exhibition of a hundred dutch paintings hung in rows certainly from the hôtel de guermantes one did not have the same kind of view but one had curious views also especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which i had placed myself and from which one’s gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded on a steep slope the mansion of the marquise de plassac and mme de tresmes cousins of the most noble category of m de guermantes whom i did not know between me and this house which was that of their father m de bréquigny nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation facing in every conceivable direction which without blocking the view increased the distance with their diagonal perspective the redtiled turret of the coachhouse in which the marquis de frécourt kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher but was so slender that it concealed nothing and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain all these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of mme de plassac actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an alpine landscape when its large paned windows glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal were thrown open so as to air the rooms one felt in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by turner or elstir a traveller in a mailcoach or a guide at different degrees of altitude on the saintgothard but from this point of view in which i had ensconced myself i should have been in danger of not seeing m or mme de guermantes come in so that when in the afternoon i was free to resume my survey i simply stood on the staircase from which the opening of the carriagegate could not escape my notice and it was on this staircase that i posted myself albeit there did not appear there so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning the alpine beauties of the bréquignytresmes mansion now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable and to reveal to me a picture no longer turneresque but ethical of so great importance that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the guermantes when i knew that they had come home it was the duke alone who received me in the library as i went in there came out a little man with snowwhite hair a look of poverty a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at combray and by several of my grandfather’s friends but of a more timid aspect than they who making me a series of profound bows refused absolutely to go downstairs until i had passed him the duke shouted after him from the library something which i did not understand and the other responded with further bows addressed to the wall for the duke could not see him but endlessly repeated nevertheless like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone he had a falsetto voice and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business and he might for that matter have been a man of business from combray so much was he in the style provincial out of date and mild of the small folk the modest elders of those parts “you shall see oriane in a minute” the duke told me when i had entered the room “as swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the order of malta and what is worse an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it’s time to go out to dinner we have such a heap of things in the house already that we don’t know where to put them all and i ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph but i have too goodnatured a wife who is too fond of giving people pleasure she thought it would be polite to ask swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those grand masters of the order whose medals he has found at rhodes i said malta didn’t i it is rhodes but it’s all the same order of saint john of jerusalem as a matter of fact she is interested in them only because swann makes a hobby of it our family is very much mixed up in the whole story even at the present day my brother whom you know is one of the highest dignitaries in the order of malta but i might have told all that to oriane she simply wouldn’t have listened to me on the other hand it was quite enough that swann’s researches into the templars it’s astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others should have led him on to the history of the knights of rhodes who succeeded the templars for oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these knights they were very small fry indeed compared with the lusignans kings of cyprus from whom we descend in a direct line but so far as swann hasn’t taken them up oriane doesn’t care to hear anything about the lusignans” i could not at once explain to the duke why i had come what happened was that several relatives or friends including mme de silistrie and the duchesse de montrose came to pay a call on the duchess who was often at home before dinner and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the duke the first of these ladies the princesse de silistrie simply attired with a dry but friendly manner carried a stick in her hand i was afraid at first that she had injured herself or was a cripple she was on the contrary most alert she spoke regretfully to the duke of a first cousin of his own — not on the guermantes side but more illustrious still were that possible — whose health which had been in a grave condition for some time past had grown suddenly worse but it was evident that the duke while full of pity for his cousin’s lot and repeating “poor mama he’s such a good fellow” had formed a favourable prognosis the fact was that the dinner at which the duke was to be present amused him the big party at the princesse de guermantes’s did not bore him but above all he was to go on at one o’clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball with a view to which a costume of louis xi for himself and one of isabel of bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness and the duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy amanien d’osmond two other ladies carrying sticks mme de plassac and mme de tresmes both daughters of the comte de bréquigny came in next to pay basin a visit and declared that cousin mama’s state left no room now for hope the duke shrugged his shoulders and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to mariegilbert’s they replied that they were not in view of the state of amanien who was in his last agony and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the duke was going the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate the brother of king theodosius the infanta maria concepcion and so forth as the marquis d’osmond was less nearly related to them than he was to basin their ‘defection’ appeared to the duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct and so albeit they had come down from the heights of the bréquigny mansion to see the duchess or rather to announce to her the alarming character incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings of their cousin’s illness they did not stay long and each armed with her alpenstock walpurge and dorothée such were the names of the two sisters retraced the craggy path to their citadel i never thought of asking the guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks so common in a certain part of the faubourg saintgermain possibly looking upon the whole parish as their domain and not caring to hire cabs they were in the habit of taking long walks for which some old fracture due to immoderate indulgence in the chase and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter but having merely come down into their garden which lay at no distance from that of the duchess to pick the fruit required for stewing had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to mme de guermantes though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a wateringcan into her house the duke appeared touched that i should have come to see them so soon after their return to paris but his face grew dark when i told him that i had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me i had touched upon one of those services which m and mme de guermantes were not fond of rendering the duke explained to me that it was too late that if the princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one that his cousins had refused him one once before and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list be ‘meddling’ finally he could not even be sure that he and his wife who were dining out that evening would not come straight home afterwards that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the princess’s party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to paris instead of hastening to inform her of it as they must do if they sent her a note or spoke to her over the telephone about me and certainly too late to be of any use since in all probability the princess’s list of guests would be closed by now “you’ve not fallen foul of her in any way” he asked in a suspicious tone the guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels and so of people’s trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders finally as the duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very goodnatured “listen my boy” he said to me suddenly as though the idea had just come into his head “i would really rather not mention at all to oriane that you have been speaking to me about it you know how kindhearted she is besides she has an enormous regard for you she would insist on sending to ask her cousin in spite of anything i might say to the contrary and if she is tired after dinner there will be no getting out of it she will be forced to go to the party no decidedly i shall say nothing to her about it anyhow you will see her yourself in a minute but not a word about that matter i beg of you if you decide to go to the party i have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you” the motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them whether he believes them to be sincere or not i did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of mme de guermantes and i promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit exactly as though i had been taken in by the little farce which m de guermantes had performed for my benefit i asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing mme de stermaria at the princess’s “why no” he replied with the air of an expert “i know the name you mention from having seen it in lists of club members it is not at all the type of person who goes to gilbert’s you will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion all the ambassadors heaps of coburgs foreign royalties but you mustn’t hope for the ghost of a stermaria gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing

    “wait now you’re fond of painting i must shew you a superb picture i bought from my cousin partly in exchange for the elstirs which frankly did not appeal to us it was sold to me as a philippe de champaigne but i believe myself that it’s by some one even greater would you like to know my idea i believe it to be a velazquez and of the best period” said the duke looking me boldly in the eyes whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it a footman came in “mme la duchesse has told me to ask m le duc if m le duc will be so good as to see m swann as mme la duchesse is not quite ready” “shew m swann in” said the duke after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress “naturally my wife who told him to come is not ready there’s no use saying anything before swann about mariegilbert’s party” said the duke “i don’t know whether he’s been invited gilbert likes him immensely because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the duc de berri but that’s a long story otherwise you can imagine my cousin who falls in a fit if he sees a jew a mile off but now don’t you see the dreyfus case has made things more serious swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows instead of which he says the most offensive things” the duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin osmond’s had returned his plan was as follows as he believed and rightly that his cousin was dying he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning once covered by the official certainty that amanien was still alive he could go without a thought to his dinner to the prince’s party to the midnight revel at which he would appear as louis xi and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress and would make no more inquiries until the following day when his pleasures would be at an end then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night “no m le duc he is not back yet” “what in the name of god nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute” cried the duke at the thought that amanien might still be in time to ‘croak’ for an evening paper and so make him miss his revel he sent for the temps in which there was nothing i had not seen swann for a long time and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front for i found in him something altered it was simply that he was indeed greatly ‘altered’ because he was very ill and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of one’s parting swann’s illness was the same that had killed his mother who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached our existences are in truth owing to heredity as full of cabalistic ciphers of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world and just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general so there is one for families in particular that is to say in any one family for the members of it who resemble one another swann was dressed with an elegance which like that of his wife associated with what he now was what he once had been buttoned up in a pearlgrey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure slender his white gloves stitched in black he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which delion had ceased now to make except for him the prince de sagan the marquis de modène m charles haas and comte louis de turenne i was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting for i had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once i told him of my astonishment he received it with a shout of laughter a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me and yet that was what had happened he did not identify me as i learned long afterwards until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned but no change in his face in his speech in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from m de guermantes had enabled him to make with such mastery with such absolute sureness did he play the social game he brought to it moreover that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative even in his style of dress which characterised the guermantes type thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman without recognising me had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist but a greeting full of a real friendliness of a true charm such as the duchesse de guermantes for instance possessed carrying it so far as to smile at you first before you had bowed to her if she met you in the street in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the faubourg saintgermain in the same way again the hat which in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear he laid on the floor by his feet was lined with green leather a thing not usually done because according to him this kept the hat much cleaner in reality because it was highly becoming “now charles you’re a great expert come and see what i’ve got to shew you after which my boys i’m going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while i go and change my clothes besides i expect oriane won’t be long now” and he shewed his ‘velazquez’ to swann “but it seems to me that i know this” said swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort “yes” said the duke turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration “you have probably seen it at gilbert’s” “oh yes of course i remember” “what do you suppose it is” “oh well if it cornes from gilbert’s it is probably one of your ancestors” said swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference

    “to be sure it is” said the duke bluntly “it’s boson the i forget how manieth de guermantes not that i care a damn about that you know i’m not as feudal as my cousin i’ve heard the names mentioned of rigaud mignard velazquez even” he went on fastening on swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response “well” he concluded for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear he had the faculty after a few moments of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered “come now none of your flattery do you think it’s by one of those big masters i’ve mentioned” “nnnnno” said swann “but after all i know nothing about these things it’s not for me to decide who daubed the canvas but you’re a dilettante a master of the subject to whom do you attribute it you’re enough of an expert to have some idea what would you put it down as” swann hesitated for a moment before the picture which obviously he thought atrocious “a bad joke” he replied with a smile at the duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage when this had subsided “be good fellows both of you wait a moment for oriane i must go and put on my swallowtails and then i’ll join you i shall send word to my good woman that you’re both waiting for her” i talked for a minute or two with swann about the dreyfus case and asked him how it was that all the guermantes were antidreyfusards “in the first place because at heart all these people are antisemites” replied swann who all the same knew very well from experience that certain of them were not but like everyone who supports any cause with ardour preferred to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion to suppose in them a preconceived reason a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done rather than reasons which might permit of discussion besides having come to the premature term of his life like a weary animal that is goaded on he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers “yes the prince de guermantes” i said “it is true i’ve heard that he was antisemitic” “oh that fellow i wasn’t even thinking about him he carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district who happened to be a jew and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door which belongs to the rothschilds” “are you going to be there this evening by any chance” “yes” swann replied “although i am far too tired but he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me i feel that i shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home it would upset me so i prefer to get it over at once” “but the duc de guermantes is not antisemitic” “you can see quite well that he is since he’s an antidreyfusard” replied swann without noticing the logical fallacy “that doesn’t prevent my being very sorry that i disappointed the man — what am i saying the duke i mean — by not admiring his mignard or whatever he calls it” “but at any rate” i went on reverting to the dreyfus case “the duchess she now is intelligent” “yes she is charming to my mind however she was even more charming when she was still known as the princesse des laumes her mind has become somehow more angular it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady but after all young or old men or women what can you expect all these people belong to a different race one can’t have a thousand years of feudalism in one’s blood with impunity naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions” “all the same robert de saintloup is a dreyfusard” “ah so much the better all the more as you know that his mother is extremely ‘and’ i had heard that he was but i wasn’t certain of it that gives me a great deal of pleasure it doesn’t surprise me he’s highly intelligent it’s a great thing that is”

   dreyfusism had brought to swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to odette this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting and was entirely to his credit since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy but swann just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind he subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion dreyfusism that the antidreyfusism of mme bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that when he was first married he should have thought her intelligent it was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price a british spy this latter was an absurdity of the guermantes set clemenceau whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience to be a man of iron like comely “no no i never told you anything of the sort you’re thinking of some one else” but sweeping past his political judgments the wave overthrew in swann his literary judgments also and even affected his way of pronouncing them barrés had lost all his talent and even the books of his early days were feeble one could hardly read them again “you try you’ll find you can’t struggle to the end what a difference from clemenceau personally i am not anticlerical but when you compare them together you must see that barrés is invertebrate he’s a very great fellow is old clemenceau how he knows the language” however the antidreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies they explained that one was a dreyfusard by one’s being of jewish origin if a practising catholic like saniette stood out also for a fresh trial that was because he was buttonholed by mme verdurin who behaved like a wild radical she was out above all things against the ‘frocks’ saniette was more fool than knave and had no idea of the harm that the mistress was doing him if you pointed out that brichot was equally a friend of mme verdurin and was a member of the patrie française that was because he was more intelligent “you see him occasionally” i asked swann referring to saintloup “no never he wrote to me the other day hoping that i would ask the duc de mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the jockey where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post” “in spite of the case” “the question was never raised however i must tell you that since all this business began i never set foot in the place”

   m de guermantes returned and was presently joined by his wife all ready now for the evening tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles she had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress “how nice it is to have one’s hat lined with leather” said the duchess whom nothing escaped “however with you charles everything is always charming whether it’s what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do” swann meanwhile without apparently listening was considering the duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master and then sought her gaze making with his lips the grimace which implies ‘the devil’ mme de guermantes rippled with laughter “so my clothes please you i’m delighted but i must say that they don’t please me much” she went on with a sulking air “good lord what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home” “what magnificent rubies” “ah my dear charles at least one can see that you know what you’re talking about you’re not like that brute monserfeuil who asked me if they were real i must say that i’ve never seen anything quite like them they were a present from the grand duchess they’re a little too large for my liking a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim but i’ve put them on because we shall be seeing the grand duchess this evening at mariegilbert’s” added mme de guermantes never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the duke “what’s on at the princess’s” inquired swann “practically nothing” the duke hastened to reply the question having made him think that swann was not invited “what’s that basin when all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured it will be a deathly crush what will be pretty though” she went on looking wistfully at swann “if the storm i can feel in the air now doesn’t break will be those marvellous gardens you know them of course i was there a month ago at the time when the lilacs were in flower you can’t have any idea how lovely they were and then the fountain really it’s versailles in paris” “what sort of person is the princess” i asked “why you know quite well you’ve seen her here she’s as beautiful as the day also rather an idiot very nice in spite of all her germanic highandmightiness full of good nature and stupid mistakes” swann was too subtle not to perceive that the duchess in this speech was trying to shew the ‘guermantes wit’ and at no great cost to herself for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own nevertheless to prove to the duchess that he appreciated her intention to be and as though she had really succeeded in being funny he smiled with a slightly forced air causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when i heard my parents discussing with m vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at montjouvain legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public “come now oriane what on earth are you saying” broke in m de guermantes “marie a fool why she has read everything she’s as musical as a fiddle” “but my poor little basin you’re as innocent as a newborn babe as if one could not be all that and rather an idiot as well idiot is too strong a word no she’s in the clouds she’s hessedarmstadt holy roman empire and wawawa her pronunciation alone makes me tired but i quite admit that she’s a charming loony simply the idea of stepping down from her german throne to go and marry in the most middleclass way a private citizen it is true that she chose him yes it’s quite true” she went on turning to me “you don’t know gilbert let me give you an idea of him he took to his bed once because i had left a card on mme carnot but my little charles” said the duchess changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the carnots appeared to irritate m de guermantes “you know you’ve never sent me that photograph of our knights of rhodes whom i’ve learned to love through you and i am so anxious to make their acquaintance” the duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife’s face “oriane you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half i ought to explain” he corrected addressing swann “that the british ambassadress at that time who was a very worthy woman but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the president and his wife we were — oriane herself was rather surprised especially as the ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us of all things to so illassorted a gathering there was a minister there who is a swindler however i pass over all that we had not been warned in time were caught in the trap and i’m bound to admit all these people behaved most civilly to us only once was enough mme de guermantes who does not often do me the honour of consulting me felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the elysée gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name but it must not be forgotten that politics apart m carnot who for that matter filled his post quite adequately was the grandson of a member of the revolutionary tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day” “in that case basin why did you go every week to dine at chantilly the due d’aumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the revolutionary tribunal with this difference that carnot was a brave man and philippe egalité a wretched scoundrel” “excuse my interrupting you to explain that i did send the photograph” said swann “i can’t understand how it hasn’t reached you” “it doesn’t altogether surprise me” said the duchess “my servants tell me only what they think fit they probably do not approve of the order of saint john” and she rang the bell “you know oriane that when i used to go to chantilly it was without enthusiasm” “without enthusiasm but with a nightshirt in a bag in case the prince asked you to stay which for that matter he very rarely did being a perfect cad like all the orléans lot do you know who else are to be dining at mme de sainteuverte’s” mme de guermantes asked her husband “besides the people you know already she’s asked at the last moment king theodosius’s brother” at these tidings the duchess’s features breathed contentment and her speech boredom “oh good heavens more princes” “but that one is wellmannered and intelligent” swann suggested “not altogether though” replied the duchess apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed “have you ever noticed with princes that the bestmannered among them are not really wellmannered they must always have an opinion about everything then as they have none of their own they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand they positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well when there is no difference listen this little theodosius junior i forget his name asked me what one called an orchestral motif i replied” said the duchess her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips “‘one calls it an orchestral motif’ i don’t think he was any too well pleased really oh my dear charles” she went on “what a bore it can be dining out there are evenings when one would sooner die it is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore because we don’t know what it’s like” a servant appeared it was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter until the duchess in her kindness of heart brought about an apparent peace between them “am i to go up this evening to inquire for m le marquis d’osmond” he asked “most certainly not nothing before tomorrow morning in fact i don’t want you to remain in the house tonight the only thing that will happen will be that his footman who knows you will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us get off go anywhere you like have a woman sleep out but i don’t want to see you here before tomorrow morning” an immense joy overflowed from the footman’s face he would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove whom he had practically ceased to see ever since after a final scene with the porter the duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better to avoid further conflicts if he did not go out at all he floated at the thought of having an evening free at last in a happiness which the duchess saw and guessed its reason she felt so to speak a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back concealing themselves from her which left her irritated and jealous “no basin let him stay here i say he’s not to stir out of the house” “but oriane that’s absurd the house is crammed with servants and you have the costumier’s people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show there’s absolutely nothing for him to do and he’s the only one who’s a friend of mama’s footman i would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house” “listen basin let me do what i want i shall have a message for him to take in the evening as it happens i can’t tell yet at what time in any case you’re not to go out of the house for a single instant do you hear” she said to the despairing footman if there were continual quarrels and if servants did not stay long with the duchess the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable but it was not the porter no doubt for the rougher tasks for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict for the quarrels which ended in blows the duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it like the household servants he admired the duchess for her kindness of heart and footmen of little discernment who came back after leaving her service to visit françoise used to say that the duke’s house would have been the finest ‘place’ in paris if it had not been for the porter’s lodge the duchess ‘played’ the lodge on them just as at different times clericalism freemasonry the jewish peril have been played on the public another footman came into the room “why have not they brought up the package that m swann sent here and by the way you’ve heard charles that mama is seriously ill jules went up to inquire for news of m le marquis d’osmond has he come back yet” “he’s just come this instant m le duc they’re waiting from one moment to the next for m le marquis to pass away” “ah he’s alive” exclaimed the duke with a sigh of relief “that’s all right that’s all right sold again satan while there’s life there’s hope” the duke announced to us with a joyful air “they’ve been talking about him as though he were dead and buried in a week from now he’ll be fitter than i am” “it’s the doctors who said that he wouldn’t last out the evening one of them wanted to call again during the night the head one said it was no use m le marquis would be dead by then they’ve only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil” “hold your tongue you damned fool” cried the duke in a paroxysm of rage “who the devil asked you to say all that you haven’t understood a word of what they told you” “it wasn’t me they told it was jules” “will you hold your tongue” roared the duke and turning to swann “what a blessing he’s still alive he will regain his strength gradually don’t you know still alive after being in such a critical state that in itself is an excellent sign one mustn’t expect everything at once it can’t be at all unpleasant a little injection of camphorated oil” he rubbed his hands “he’s alive what more could anyone want after going through all that he’s gone through it’s a great step forward upon my word i envy him having such a temperament ah these invalids you know people do all sorts of little things for them that they don’t do for us now today there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with béarnaise sauce — it was done to a turn i must admit but just for that very reason i took so much of it that it’s still lying on my stomach however that doesn’t make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear amanien we do too much inquiring it only tires him we must let him have room to breathe they’re killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time” “well” said the duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room “i gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which m swann sent me to be brought up here” “madame la duchesse it is so large that i didn’t know if i could get it through the door we have left it in the hall does madame la duchesse wish me to bring it up” “oh in that case no they ought to have told me but if it’s so big i shall see it in a moment when i come downstairs” “i forgot to tell mme la duchesse that mme la comtesse mole left a card this morning for mme la duchesse” “what this morning” said the duchess with an air of disapproval feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning “about ten o’clock madame la duchesse” “shew me the cards” “in any case oriane when you say that it was a funny idea on marie’s part to marry gilbert” went on the duke reverting to the original topic of conversation “it is you who have an odd way of writing history if either of them was a fool it was gilbert for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the king of the belgians who has usurped the name of brabant which belongs to us to put it briefly we are of the same blood as the hesses and of the elder branch it is always stupid to talk about oneself” he apologised to me “but after all whenever we have been not only at darmstadt but even at cassel and all over electoral hesse the landgraves have always all of them been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch” “but really basin you don’t mean to tell me that a person who was a major in every regiment in her country who had been engaged to the king of sweden    ” “oriane that is too much anyone would think that you didn’t know that the king of sweden’s grandfather was tilling the soil at pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of europe” “that doesn’t alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street ‘hallo there’s the king of sweden’ everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the place de la concorde and if he said ‘there’s m de guermantes’ nobody would know who m de guermantes was” “what an argument” “besides i never can understand how once the title of duke of brabant has passed to the belgian royal family you can continue to claim it”

   the footman returned with the comtesse mole’s card or rather what she had left in place of a card alleging that she had none on her she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription ‘la comtesse mole’ as the envelope was rather large following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year this manuscript ‘card’ was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card “that is what people call mme mole’s ‘simplicity’” said the duchess ironically “she wants to make us think that she had no cards on her and to shew her originality but we know all about that don’t we my little charles we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years she is charming but she doesn’t seem to me all the same to be quite ‘big’ enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten o’clock in the morning her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that” swann could not help smiling at the thought that the duchess who was incidentally a trifle jealous of mme mole’s success would find it quite in accordance with the ‘guermantes wit’ to make some impertinent retort to her visitor “so far as the title of duc de brabant is concerned i’ve told you a hundred times oriane    ” the duke continued but the duchess without listening cut him short “but my little charles i’m longing to see your photograph” “ah extinctor draconis latrator anubis” said swann “yes it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the saint george at venice but i don’t understand why anubis” “what’s the one like who was an ancestor of babal” asked m de guermantes “you want to see his bauble” retorted his wife dryly to shew she herself scorned the pun “i want to see them all” she added “listen charles let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes” said the duke “you can pay your call on us in the hall because my wife won’t let us have any peace until she’s seen your photograph i am less impatient i must say” he added with a satisfied air “i am not easily moved myself but she would see us all dead rather than miss it” “i am entirely of your opinion basin” said the duchess “let us go into the hall we shall at least know why we have come down from your study while we shall never know how we have come down from the counts of brabant” “i’ve told you a hundred times how the title came into the house of hesse” said the duke while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph and i thought of those that swann used to bring me at combray “through the marriage of a brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last landgrave of thuringia and hesse so that really it is the title of prince of hesse that came to the house of brabant rather than that of duke of brabant to the house of hesse you will remember that our battlecry was that of the dukes of brabant ‘limbourg to her conqueror’ until we exchanged the arms of brabant for those of guermantes in which i think myself that we were wrong and the example of the gramonts will not make me change my opinion” “but” replied mme de guermantes “as it is the king of the belgians who is the conqueror    besides the belgian crown prince calls himself duc de brabant” “but my dear child your argument will not hold water for a moment you know as well as i do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers for instance the king of spain describes himself equally as duke of brabant claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours but more ancient than that of the king of the belgians he calls himself also duke of burgundy king of the indies occidental and oriental and duke of milan well he is no more in possession of burgundy the indies or brabant than i possess brabant myself or the prince of hesse either for that matter the king of spain likewise proclaims himself king of jerusalem as does the austrian emperor and jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other” he stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of jerusalem might have embarrassed swann in view of ‘current events’ but only went on more rapidly “what you said just now might be said of anyone we were at one time dukes of aumale a duchy that has passed as regularly to the house of france as joinville and chevreuse have to the house of albert we make no more claim to those titles than to that of marquis de noirmoutiers which was at one time ours and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the house of la trémoïlle but because certain cessions are valid it does not follow that they all are for instance” he went on turning to me “my sisterinlaw’s son bears the title of prince d’agrigente which comes to us from joan the mad as that of prince de tarente comes to the la trémoïlles well napoleon went and gave this title of tarente to a soldier who may have been admirable in the ranks but in doing so the emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than napoleon iii when he created a duc de montmorency since périgord had at least a mother who was a montmorency while the tarente of napoleon i had no more tarente about him than napoleon’s wish that he should become so that did not prevent chaix d’estange alluding to our uncle condé from asking the procurer impérial if he had picked up the title of duc de montmorency in the moat of vincennes”

    “listen basin i ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of vincennes or even to tarante and that reminds me charles of what i was going to say to you when you were telling me about your saint george at venice we have an idea basin and i of spending next spring in italy and sicily if you were to come with us just think what a difference it would make i’m not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you but imagine after all you’ve told me so often about the remains of the norman conquest and of ancient history imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us i mean to say that even basin — what am i saying gilbert — would benefit by it because i feel that even his claims to the throne of naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings but now we’re going to look at your photograph open the envelope” said the duchess to a footman “please oriane not this evening you can look at it tomorrow” implored the duke who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph “but i like to look at it with charles” said the duchess with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle for in her desire to be friendly to swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits “all right he will come again to see you on purpose” declared the duke to whom his wife was obliged to yield “you can spend three hours in front of it if that amuses you” he added ironically “but where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions” “why in my room of course i like to have it before my eyes” “oh just as you please if it’s in your room probably i shall never see it” said the duke without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations “very well you will undo it with the greatest care” mme de guermantes told the servant multiplying her instructions out of politeness to swann “and see that you don’t crumple the envelope either” “so even the envelope has got to be respected” the duke murmured to me raising his eyes to the ceiling “but swann” he added “i who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic what i wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size where did you pick it up” “oh at the photographer’s they’re always sending out things like that but the man is a fool for i see he’s written on it ‘the duchesse de guermantes’ without putting ‘madame’” “i’ll forgive him for that” said the duchess carelessly then seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her checked a faint smile but at once returning to swann “well you don’t say whether you’re coming to italy with us” “madame i am really afraid that it will not be possible” “indeed mme de montmorency is more fortunate you went with her to venice and vicenza she told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise things no one had ever thought of mentioning before that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of and that even in the wellknown things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing obviously she has been more highly favoured than we are to be    you will take the big envelope from m swann’s photograph” she said to the servant “and you will hand it in from me this evening at half past ten at mme la comtesse mole’s” swann laughed “i should like to know all the same” mme de guermantes asked him “how ten months before the time you can tell that a thing will be impossible” “my dear duchess i will tell you if you insist upon it but first of all you can see that i am very ill” “yes my little charles i don’t think you look at all well i’m not pleased with your colour but i’m not asking you to come with me next week i ask you to come in ten months in ten months one has time to get oneself cured you know” at this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door “come oriane to horse” said the duke already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside “very well give me in one word the reason why you can’t come to italy” the duchess put it to swann as she rose to say goodbye to us “but my dear friend it’s because i shall then have been dead for several months according to the doctors i consulted last winter the thing i’ve got — which may for that matter carry me off at any moment — won’t in any case leave me more than three or four months to live and even that is a generous estimate” replied swann with a smile while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the duchess out “what’s that you say” cried the duchess stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage and raising her fine eyes their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow and not knowing which to choose felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered so as to follow the first which demanded of her at the moment less effort and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed “you’re joking” she said to swann “it would be a joke in charming taste” replied he ironically “i don’t know why i am telling you this i have never said a word to you before about my illness but as you asked me and as now i may die at any moment    but whatever i do i mustn’t make you late you’re dining out remember” he added because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness but that of the duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to swann than his own death and so while continuing on her way towards the carriage she let her shoulders droop saying “don’t worry about our dinner it’s not of any importance” but this put the duke in a bad humour who exclaimed “come oriane don’t stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with swann you know very well that mme de sainteuverte insists on sitting down to table at eight o’clock sharp we must know what you propose to do the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes i beg your pardon charles” he went on turning to swann “but it’s ten minutes to eight already oriane is always late and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old sainteuverte’s” mme de guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to swann “you know we can talk about that another time i don’t believe a word you’ve been saying but we must discuss it quietly i expect they gave you a dreadful fright come to luncheon whatever day you like” with mme de guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons “you will let me know your day and time” and lifting her red skirt she set her foot on the step she was just getting into the carriage when seeing this foot exposed the duke cried in a terrifying voice “oriane what have you been thinking of you wretch you’ve kept on your black shoes with a red dress go upstairs quick and put on red shoes or rather” he said to the footman “tell the lady’s maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes” “but my dear” replied the duchess gently annoyed to see that swann who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us could hear “since we are late” “no no we have plenty of time it is only ten to it won’t take us ten minutes to get to the parc monceau and after all what would it matter if we turned up at half past eight they’d have to wait for us but you can’t possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes besides we shan’t be the last i can tell you the sassenages are coming and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine” the duchess went up to her room “well” said m de guermantes to swann and myself “we poor downtrodden husbands people laugh at us but we are of some use all the same but for me oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes” “it’s not unbecoming” said swann “i noticed the black shoes and they didn’t offend me in the least” “i don’t say you’re wrong” replied the duke “but it looks better to have them to match the dress besides you needn’t worry she would no sooner have got there than she’d have noticed them and i should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others i should have had my dinner at nine o’clock goodbye my children” he said thrusting us gently from the door “get away before oriane comes down again it’s not that she doesn’t like seeing you both on the contrary she’s too fond of your company if she finds you still here she will start talking again she is tired out already she’ll reach the dinnertable quite dead besides i tell you frankly i’m dying of hunger i had a wretched luncheon this morning when i came from the train there was the devil of a béarnaise sauce i admit but in spite of that i shan’t be at all sorry not at all sorry to sit down to dinner five minutes to eight oh women women she’ll give us both indigestion before tomorrow she is not nearly as strong as people think” the duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wife’s ailments and his own to a dying man for the former interested him more appeared to him more important and so it was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that after politely shewing us out he cried ‘from off stage’ in a stentorian voice from the porch to swann who was already in the courtyard “you now don’t let yourself be taken in by the doctors’ nonsense damn them they’re donkeys you’re as strong as the pont neuf you’ll live to bury us all”embed"
