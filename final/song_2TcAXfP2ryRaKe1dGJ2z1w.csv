i need this to get me through cant resist dont want to
believe it i know its true cant beat it dont want to try

verse 1
perfect hell its more to me than you ever will know
down here where the rest of us fell
waste away with nothing left to show
while im in this perfect hell

prechorus
obsession has begun possessed by destruction
how did i get so low believe me no one knows
sometimes i cant hold on and no one can help me

chorus
now its got a hold of me hold of me
i dont think i can make it through this
now its got a hold of me hold of me
the less i do the more it makes no sense

verse 2
im walking pollution whos drained by delusions
on the verge of destruction i cave in to abduction
thin blood im bleeding my pulse wont stop racing
just as my heart explodes
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeprechorus
no chance that i could win too hard to not give in
i just dont feel the same cause im the one to blame
sometimes i cant hold on and no one can help me

chorus
now its got a hold of me hold of me
i dont think i can make it through this
now its got a hold of me hold of me
the less i do the more it makes no sense

bridge
i need this to be myself it feels like i need some help
its too late to save myself or its just in my head

chorus
now its got a hold of me hold of me
i dont think i can make it through this
now its got a hold of me hold of me
the less i do the more it makes no sense
now its got a hold of me hold of me
i dont think i can make it through this
now its got a hold of me hold of me
the less i do the more it makes no sense4embed"
