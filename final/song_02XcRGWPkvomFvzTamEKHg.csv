at the end of the day i still thank god for everything that you know hes put in front of me
but this materialistic money stuff dont really mean nothin like you know my relationship is good i got money but theres still other issues to talk about other than heartbreak right
youve got anxiety youve got substance abuse youve got you know and its a lot of issues in the world to talk about
i dont know music is just a beautiful thing like i love myself so much as far as the way i make music the way god made me the way god wired me to do the things that i do and to change the world the way that i can
i think youre an agent of change i think youre touchin in a way this generation that very few if no one else can
before i get up out of here i wanna tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to period
as long as you work hard give it your all and dont listen to what anybody got to say its your world you can do what you want on bro period
always remember that i love every single last one of yall everybody get home safe gang gangyou might also like22embed"
