well i felt the burn
since the day you departed and talked from the tomb
im still healing those wounds
and it holds me down
but made me a man that says
fuck all those rules i will be who i choose
its a lonely road
with one grip on several psalms and one grip on the gun
and it holds the rope
that spins me in circles and dizzies my head
then says sleep when youre dead

verse 2
were you ever here
or just lost on the surface that at the first touch just evades in the dust
and it pulled me down
and showed me my demons lined up in a sequence forming a crowd
it was so long
with a piece of happy home that they stripped from the bone
i did not react
i settled my grievance by crafting a mask
and i never looked back

bridge
tell me what you know
im in deeper than ive ever been
i will never grow
while this anchor is chained to my feet
tell me what you know
im in deeper than ive ever been
i will never grow
while this anchor is chained to my feet

i settled my grievance by crafting a mask
and i never looked

i settled my grievance by crafting a mask
and i never looked
i will never grow
i settled my grievance by crafting a mask
and i never looked back5embed"
