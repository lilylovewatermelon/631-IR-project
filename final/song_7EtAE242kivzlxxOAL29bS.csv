i remember it was new years
you was in the studio when i did chosen one
my nigga double d was there

verse 1
gutter nigga til the dirt
margiela my fur
almost overdosin on percs
wakin up drinkin that syrup
bentley spur with the curtains

verse 2
crack in the bushes im tryna buy me a new 88 cutlass supreme
every day hustlin i gotta go get it
i gotta get wutang man gotta get cream
long as they print it my niggas gon get it
all of my love i gave it to my city
all of that game you gave me cant forget it
all that finesse you gave me aint forget it
i turned the whole world up now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin
these niggas so broke instead of go and get it theyd rather go ask for somethin
remember them days i had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin
remember we jugged for somethin
remember we take for somethin yeah yeah
i spent three stacks on these rick owens i try my best to forget it
i pour my life inside these poems my whole soul and my spirit
im easily agitated get intoxicated tryna fight the demons
tryna find right in my wrong hope my legacy live on
hope my legacy live on
thats why i wrote this song
i aint have to write this song
future hendrix is forever
