ooh lets go

verse 1
steve walks warily down the street
with the brim pulled way down low
aint no sound but the sound of his feet
machine guns ready to go
are you ready hey are you ready for this
are you hanging on the edge of your seat
out of the doorway the bullets rip
to the sound of the beat yeah

chorus
another one bites the dust
another one bites the dust
and another one gone and another one gone
another one bites the dust yeah
hey im gonna get you too
another one bites the dust
verse 2
how do you think im going to get along
without you when youre gone
you took me for everything that i had
and kicked me out on my own
are you happy are you satisfied
how long can you stand the heat
out of the doorway the bullets rip
to the sound of the beat
