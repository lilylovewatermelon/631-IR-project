halleys waitress
never comes around
shes hiding in the kitchen
shes nowhere to be found
i just want some coffee
is that too much to ask
halleys waitress
is not up to the task
and when she finally appears
its like shes been away for years

chorus
its been so long
so long
darling dont you know
we miss you when youre gone
so long
so long
darling dont you know
we miss you when youre gone
ahhh

verse 2
halleys waitress
has vanished once again
shes talking to her agent
shes calling all her friends
forget about the coffee
ill just take a check
halleys waitress
you know youll get yours yet

its been so long
so long
darling dont you know
we miss you when youre gone
so long
so long
darling dont you know
we miss you when youre gone
ahhhembed"
