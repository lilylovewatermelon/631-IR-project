i can tell these niggas mad as fuck 
because they show it
ion give no fuck he pull on me and imma throw him
twenty ton guns dont mean shit to jack6
play with me ill bring bryan fury
to shake ya clique nigga 
i got lots of codenames
from my boyz
just incase they gotta pull through and make that noise
mayne im smarter than you other niggas nonchalant snitchin
police aint tracin shit back over here nigga 
why you think i talk my shit
because im ready
everybody know somethin you dont

disrespect now he a grave creature

mayne im sick of all that rapper shit i hate these niggas
imma trip im finna crack a zip i leave em skimpin
