parallel to none i am perpendicular
hit em with the oh now thats just ridiculous
we coulda cleared up all these particulars
that coulda been the homicide vehicular
you wasnt in no state to speed off
you was buggin out yeah you was pd off
we was just chillin up at the ski loft
thinkin we was on you tellin me we off
your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
thats the effect they call a snowball
next thing you know i was runnin down the hall
sayin please come back i have given my all
i have given my all
funny how you could always make me feel small
i have given my all
catch me catch me i think im gon fall

you wanted ohsobad to prove points
but your game always makes me lose points
and your game always makes me concur
that maybe i shoulda never taken you from her
but with all of the aforementioned
i am still trapped in your dimension
so i will be on the mountain waiting
cause i am in need of more attention
coulda called back just to say somethin
ima fall back in the bass drum
please come to destination

you succeeded at your attempts to make me
need you desperately to vindicate me
its funny how you could always make me feel small
i have given my all
catch me catch me i think im gon fall

chorus
my mind is made up im waitin for you
im waitin on you waitin boy
