i shouldve known by the way you passed me by
there was something in your eyes and it wasnt right
i shouldve walked but i never had the chance
everything got out of hand and i let it slide

prechorus 1
now i only have myself to blame
for falling for your stupid games
i wish my life could be the way
it was before i saw your face

chorus
you stole my happy you made me cry
took the lonely and took me for a ride
and i wanna uhuhuhuhuhundo it
you had my heart now i want it back
im starting to see everything you lack
boy you blew it you put me through it
i wanna uhuhuhuhuhundo it
