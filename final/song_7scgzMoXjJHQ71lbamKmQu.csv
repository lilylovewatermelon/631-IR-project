don’t use a weakness don’t change the subject
don’t ask the questions if you fear the answer
you look distorted let’s make you clearer
let’s flip the switch and use the smoke and mirrors

prechorus
reinvent yourself today
reinvent your world today

chorus
crying out for the last time
clear a space for the warning signs
crying out for the last time
and there’s no turning back now that you’ve opened up to your mind

verse 2
what guides your vision what holds the balance
don’t think that i can’t see you shake and tremble
well i know you’re nervous this world is scary
you have to let go all the madness you carry

prechorus
reinvent yourself today
reinvent your world today

there is no turning back now
everything you’ve ever wanted
everything in this moment
there is no turning back now
