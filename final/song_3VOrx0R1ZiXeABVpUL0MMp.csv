jumping ship jumping on my bed
you snuck into my room danced away the night
i turned off my light i turned off my light
so watch me baby follow my lead
they cant stop us now take what you need
you came to smash it all
what we got to lose
in a black tuxedo and shiny shoes

chorus
we came to smash smash
we came to smash
we came to smash smash
we came to smash
smash smash
we came to smash

in black tux
in black tux
we came to smash smash

we came to smash in black tux
we came to smash smash
in the black tuxedo
you might also likeits not too late i swear its not
your friends asleep the sky is polka dot
pack up your car in the parking lot
lets take a ride to my vacation spot
the streets are full fuck it well walk
call my phone if you wanna talk
we got no bars its dark in here
i only shine so i can disappear

chorus
in black tux
in black tux
we came to smash smash
we came to smash in black tux
we came to smash in the black tuxedoembed"
