i do my best to find some kind of glow
im givin it some heart and soul now from the darkest grays
the sun bursts clouds break
yeah we see that fire from the streets of babylon
to the road that weve been on now
the kaleidoscope claims another
oh oh oh oh oh

chorus
well this is life in color color
today feels like no other other
and the darkest grays
the sun bursts clouds break woahohohoh
well this is life in motion motion
and just when i couldnt run this race no
the sun bursts clouds break
this is life in color

verse 2
youve seen my worst and yet you see some hope in me
the black and white set us free like the queen to the rook
your decision was a sure thing
honey yeah a sure thing
no wonder i feel like im missing a heavy load
but no matter what daylight brings to us we all know oh oh oh oh
