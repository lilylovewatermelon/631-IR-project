real men dont need other people
and real men suck it in
real men dont flinch or bleed in public
oh i think im a real man

verse 2
little boys cry and look around for comfort
and always get what they want
little boys see toys and say i can take that
oh you are my little boy

chorus 1
though honestly sir
all i wanna do is get naked in front of you
so you can look me up and down and tell me
well done girl youre looking good

verse 3
real men keep cool in the face of a fire
go down with the ship
and real men dont eat cause theyre above that damn it
oh im gonna be a real man

chorus 2
ohoh ohoh though honestly sir
all i wanna do is get naked in front of you
so you can look me up and down
and give me your love for being so good
