she she screams in silence
a sullen riot penetrating through her mind
waiting for a sign
to smash the silence with the brick of selfcontrol

chorus
are you locked up in a world thats been planned out for you
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
scream at me until my ears bleed
im takin heed just for you

verse 2
she shes figured out
all her doubts were someone elses point of view
wakin up this time
to smash the silence with the brick of selfcontrol

chorus
are you locked up in a world thats been planned out for you
are you feeling like a social tool without a use
scream at me until my ears bleed
im takin heed just for you
