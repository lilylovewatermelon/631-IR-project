waitin at a stoplight yesterday as a funeral procession made its way
through the gates
i watched it roll up a windin road through a field of green with white headstones
all in a row

prechorus 1
and it made me think about where im at
on my not so straight and narrow path
all the generous and mostly undeserved
blessings that ive had

chorus 1
i had an allamerican mom and dad
some of the coolest friends you could ever have
found love i thought id never find
sometimes i cant believe this life is mine
and im not plannin on leavin yet
but the truth is you just never know
and if this is as good as it gets
man i think im good to go
im good to go

verse 2
i said a prayer for the dearly departed and the loved ones left broken hearted
then traffic started
and i drove away a little more able to see the good things on my table
and that im grateful

cause i have had my troubles had my trials
ive hit the mark and ive missed by miles
had days that ive been fightin mad
but the good times have more than outweighed the bad

chorus 2
i got to hold my newborn baby girl
and the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
ive laughed so hard i couldnt stop
seen the sunrise from a mountain top
and im not plannin on leavin yet
but the truth is you just never know
and if this is as good as it gets
man i think im good to go

interlude

verse 3
yeah ive been thinkin bout where i am at
on my not so straight and narrow path
and i wouldnt wanna change nothin about
this roll with the punches life ive had

chorus 
i had an allamerican mom and dad
some of the coolest friends you could ever have
found love i thought id never find
i cant believe this life is mine
and im not plannin on leavin yet
but the truth is you just never know
and if this is as good as it gets
man i think im good to go
outro
im good to go
im good to goembed"
