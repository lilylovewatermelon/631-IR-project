ill say it straight and plain
i know ive made mistakes
ive always been afraid
ive always been afraid
a thousand nights or more
i travel east and north
but please answer the door

prechorus
can you tell me

chorus
you say that love goes anywhere
in your darkest time its just enough to know its there
when you go ill let you be
but youre killing everything in me

verse 2
get down on your knees
whisper what i need
something pretty
something pretty
i feel that when im old
ill look at you and know the world was beautiful
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likeprechorus
then you tell me

chorus
you say that love goes anywhere
in your darkest time its just enough to know its there
when you go ill let you be
but youre killing everything in me

bridge
im done theres nothing left to show
i try but cant let it go
are you happy where youre standing still
do you really want the sugar pill
ill wake up tomorrow and ill start
tonight it feels so hard
as the train approaches gare du nord
as im sure your kiss remains employed
am i only dreaming

chorus
you say that love goes anywhere
in your darkest time its just enough to know its there
when you go ill let you be
but youre killing everything in me
outro
when you go ill let you be
but youre killing everything in me3embed"
