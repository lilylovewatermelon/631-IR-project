you know id fall apart without you
i dont know how you do what you do
cause everything that dont make sense about me
makes sense when im with you

verse 2
like everything thats green girl
i need you
but its more than one and one makes two
put aside the math and the logic of it
you gotta know youre wanted too

cause i wanna wrap you up
wanna kiss your lips
i wanna make you feel wanted
and i wanna call you mine
wanna hold your hand forever
and never let you forget it
yeah i i wanna make you feel wanted

verse 3
well anyone can tell you youre pretty
and you get that all the time i know you do
but your beautys deeper than the makeup
and i wanna show you what i see tonight
chorus
when i wrap you up
when i kiss your lips
i i wanna make you feel wanted
and i wanna call you mine
wanna hold your hand forever
and never let you forget it
cause baby i i wanna make you feel wanted

as good as you make me feel make me feel
i wanna make you feel better
better than your fairy tales than your fairy tales
better than your best dreams your best dreams
youre more than everything i need
youre all i ever wanted
all i ever wanted

chorus
and i just wanna wrap you up
wanna kiss your lips
i i wanna make you feel wanted
and i wanna call you mine
wanna hold your hand forever
and never let you forget it
yeah i i wanna make you feel wanted
