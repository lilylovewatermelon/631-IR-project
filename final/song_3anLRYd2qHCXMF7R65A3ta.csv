fuck you all
motherfucker

verse 1
running out of ways to run
i cant see i can’t be
over and over and under my skin
all this attention is doing me in

chorus
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
don’t give a shit dont ever judge me

verse 2
picking through the parts exposed
taking shape taking shag
over and over and under my skin
all this momentum is doing me in

chorus
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likebridge
you got all my love living in your own hate
dripping hole man hard step no fate
show you nothing but i aint holding back
every damn word i say is a sneak attack
when i get my hands on you
aint a fucking thing you can do
get this ’cause you’re never gonna get me
i am the very disease you pretend to be
get your middle fingers up
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move

chorus
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong don’t exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me

chorus
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong don’t exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me
