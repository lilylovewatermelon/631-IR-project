be brave reshape
cant force all into molds
passing out schematics
forcing all into molds

chorus
once more about to change
some try and fall beneath molds
well its your right so ill keep on this path
turning around bending the shapes cutting it in
we could excel beyond the latter fools
start a new tone hating the same empty the room

verse 2
so create reclaim
sovereign shapes tempting us
ration out their schematics
dare we live without molds

chorus
so far whats left between
they tried and fail beneath molds
well its your right so ill keep on this path
turning around bending the shapes cutting it in
we could excel beyond the latter fools
start a new tone hating the same empty the room
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likebridge
feel locked in a room
and starting to choke
enticing the shame
awaken a world

chorus 2
well its your right so ill keep on this path
turning around bending the shapes cutting it in
we could excel beyond the latter fools
start a new tone hating the same empty the room

outro
so be brave reshape create reclaim
so be brave reshape create reclaimembed"
