when all you thought about was drinkin
thinkin bout the weekend
when you didnt really wanna go
till you knew that there was someone
when youre ready to roll

but if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what youre fighting for
so while youre waiting hoping
every little things gonna be alright
you gotta know when youll be
lookin for the ones that are ready to fight

so if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what youre fighting for

theyve been searching for the answer oh
to all the questions that are known
i really dont think you
never found the reason for the one thing
that will keep on movin while im losin my mind

or feel like givin up

save you from yourself

so while youre waiting hoping
every little things gonna be alright
you gotta know when youll be
lookin for the ones that are ready to fight

but if you feel like making war
then you better talk about it
before you get it started
and if you feel like makin war
then you better realize what youre fighting for
