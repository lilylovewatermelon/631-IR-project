verse 1
just copped your girl a brand new rolex
but you can never find the time to spend at home
thinking thats gon keep her happy
when time is all she wanted all along

chorus
its the simple things in life we forget
you hear her talking but dont hear what she said
why do you make something so easy so complicated
searching for whats right in front of your face
but you cant see it

verse 2
so you think that you know whats important
steady chasing your fame and your fortune
but you dont know youre chasing a dime losing a treasure
those dollars dont make sense to me at all
ooh it goes duh da duh da
you give her spending money duh da duh da
but all she wanna spend is time alone tonight
keep giving her the finer things but
but she dont really need that if you dont stop youre
youre gonna end up alone alone
in a world without love duh duh da duh da
why would you do it
