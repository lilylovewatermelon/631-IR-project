in time shell see that her and me
were meant to be together
and time will pass it may go fast
but well still be together
and where i go shes at my side half of my life together
its easy love fits like a glove from up above together

chorus
together
together

verse 2
ive had my share its just not fair
that we should be together
but if its fine that ive done my time
lets walk the line together
and when shes low ill always know
well always go together
its easy love fits like a glove from up above together

chorus
together
together
together
