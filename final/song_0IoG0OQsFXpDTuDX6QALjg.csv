sun comin up over new york city
school bus driver in a traffic jam
starin at the faces in her rearview mirror
looking at the promise of the promised land
one kid dreams of fame and fortune
one kid helps pay the rent
one could end up goin to prison
one just might be president

chorus
only in america
dreamin in red white and blue
only in america
where we dream as big as we want to
we all get a chance
everybody gets to dance
only in america

verse 2
sun goin down on an la freeway
newlyweds in the back of a limousine
a welders son and a bankers daughter
all they want is everything
she came out here to be an actress
he was the singer in a band
they just might go back to oklahoma
and talk about the stars they could have been

only in america
dreamin in red white and blue

where we dream as big as we want to
and we all get a chance
everybody gets to dance
