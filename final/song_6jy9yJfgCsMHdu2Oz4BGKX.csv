i know that i hurt you
yeah
i was a child trying to be a man
to all my sons worldwide
i walked out on my only son
all my juniors
i left you in your mothers hands
i apologize for my absence i know i left you without an annual drop
and now im standing right here
i dont know how i expected you to get your clout up and get your money up but
with tears with tears streaming from my eyes
dont worry
see your mother raised a fine young man
daddys home
and i know i missed so much of your life
turn me up mario

verse drake

lock the door to the bathroom cause they doin something that is not pepsi
im just pourin up the shots
i remember that i told you i miss you that was kinda like a mass text
i remember that i told i loved you that was really in the past tense
i remember that i told you i get you truth is that i get around
mentioned havin us a kid 42 hit i tend to kid around
