jimmy was your sweetie pie
your precious one
and i knew you used to love
the very ground he walked upon
one day jims papa told him
things were looking down
and they packed up everything
they owned and left this little old town
each tear i dried for you
the closer our lives grew
i fell in love its true
and you say you love me too

chorus
well dont you know im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved him
oohbaby im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved him
oh baby
but baby im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved him
oh baby im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved jim

the day you see his face again
or hear his voice
i dont want to be a loser
if you have to make a choice
like a puppet to a string
to you girl im attached
and i know id be in trouble
if he came and took you back
i feel so insecure
in my mind i can picture
losing you for sure
and the pain i cant endure

chorus
oh baby im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved him
oh baby im wondering
sure enough im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved jim
ooh baby

verse 3
i cant stop loving you baby
i cant stop loving you  no
i cant stop loving you baby
i feel so insecure
in my mind i
can picture
losing you for sure
and the pain i cant endure
baby im worried
really really worried
i wanna make you happy
really truly happy
chorus
oh baby im wondering
little girl im wondering
how can i make you love me
a little more than you loved him
oh baby im wondering
little girl im wonderingembed"
