verse
finding myself
showing myself
finding a way to stay outta the way
holding me back
supposed to come right back
guardin myself while im all on display
i know you know all about it
i know deep down you feel the same
i know you know how i feel
i know you know how i feel
how do i how do i feel how do i feel
how do you say to my face time heals
then go and leave me again unreal
i see us fadin away
im still holdin my breath for the day that you will
see that the effort i make is too real
how can you say that you know how i feel
ayy whee
how can you say you know what im feeling wait
know what im feeling wait
you dont feel nothing wait
nothing is healing wait
time is just killing wait
how can you say wait
you know what im feeling wait
know what im feeling wait
you dont feel nothing wait
time isnt healing wait
time is revealing wait
how are you feeling wait
you dont feel nothing
