kickin kids shins with his steel boot toe
with his chin up high and his feet down low
so no one tells him which way to go
and i dont know just what it will take
watch and see all of his mistakes
and stumbling onto the ground again
and off to the jailhouse is where hes sent
he wore his pants too low
he spiked his hair too high
he never said goodbye

that punk rock billy hes the one
aint nobody gonna fuck with me
knowin theyll end up dead
why the fuck would they call lapd
cause you know those dudes cant catch me
say where i live theres no sunshine
kickin in heads and your behind
wanna fuck with me just one more time
punk rock billy this is your last time

he wore his pants too low
he spiked his hair too high
he never said goodbye
that punk rock billy hes the oneyou might also likeembed"
