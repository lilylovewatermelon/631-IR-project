ooh

verse 1
falling in hate with you
more and more every day
falling away from this
in every way

prechorus
is it right is it wrong
you and i dont belong

chorus
falling in hate
nothing to say dont want to hear you
falling away
nothing to give no
falling in hate
nothing but fear in your heart
falling away
nothing to live for

verse 2
to you its a game
to me its a joke
a mile to hang by
with one inch of rope
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likeprechorus
is it wrong is it right
you and i day and night

chorus
falling in hate
nothing to say dont want to hear you
falling away
nothing to give no
falling in hate
nothing but fear in your heart
falling away
nothing to live for

bridge
despite what you think of me
and despite what you say
i gave you everything and
you threw it away

chorus
falling in hate
nothing to say dont want to hear you
falling away
nothing to give no
falling in hate
nothing but fear in your heart
falling away
nothing to live for2embed"
