holdin out
another day has come and let you down
all of our yesterdays have gone now
tearin’ up
lookin for a shoulder to prop you up

prechorus
all of our yesterdays have gone now
all of our yesterdays have gone now
all of our yesterdays have gone now
all of our yesterdays have gone

chorus
and that dont mean your dream is over
and that don’t make your heart beat slower
such a shame to complain
when all of our yesterdays have gone away

verse 2

when all of our yesterdays have gone away11embed"
