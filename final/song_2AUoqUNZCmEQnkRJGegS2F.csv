good morning day sorry im not there
but all my favorite friends vanished in the air
its hard to fly when you cant even run
once i had the world but now ive got no one

chorus
if i needed someone to control me
if i needed someone to hold me down
i would change my direction
and save myself before i
if i needed someone to control me
if i needed someone to push me around
i would change my direction
and save myself before i drown
drown

once i had this world but now ive lost it all

chorus
if i needed someone to control me
if i needed someone to hold me down
i would change my direction
and save myself before i
if i needed someone to control me
if i needed someone to push me around
i would change my direction
and save myself before i drown
