cant take my eyes off of you
when im scrolling through its true
try to understand everything that i am is on display
in a room full of strangers closing in on me

prechorus
you cloud up my day
in the worst kind of way
you cloud up my day
in the worst kind of way

chorus
lost in club social
where these thoughts are so vocal
im going round in circles
im going round in circles

verse 2
enveloped in these thoughts but its all irrelevant
cant get too caught up in that sea of arrogance
anyone can be anonymous
dont let that break down your own confidence

prechorus
you cloud up my day
in the worst kind of way
you cloud up my day
in the worst kind of way
you might also likechorus
lost in club social
where these thoughts are so vocal
im going round in circles
im going round in circles

verse 3
turn the other way
theres no reason to stay
and when you return
those voices wont be a concernembed"
