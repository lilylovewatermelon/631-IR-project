in the middle of a gunfight
in the center of a restaurant
they say come with your arms raised high

well theyre never gonna get me
like a bullet through a flock of doves
to wage this war against your faith in me
your life will never be the same
on your mothers eyes say a prayer

chorus gerard way

how were just two men as god had made us
well i cant well i can yeah
too much too late or just not enough of this
pain in my heart for your dying wish
ill kiss your lips again

verse 2 gerard way  bert mccracken
they all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
my cellmates​ a killer they make me do pushups in drag
but nobody cares if youre losing yourself

or lethal injection or swing from a rope if you dare
