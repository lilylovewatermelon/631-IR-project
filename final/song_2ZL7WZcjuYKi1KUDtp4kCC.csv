verse 2 drake
damn just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
are makin laws about what women can do
i gotta protect ya im a made man tied in all the way baby
so i gotta respect ya
niggas put hands on you in the past insecure because your body is precious
four words when i think about them is crusty musty dusty rusty
eight words when i think about us is fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me
disrespect ya and ill smack em
the texts that you send in captions
the videos we got ever leak we goin viral or goin platinum
dont worry bout your friends story when i had her alone
she gon try and put some extras on it take you out of your zone
you know how it goes when they cant get a reservation up in carbone
they gon tell you its a chill night tell you how theyd rather stay home yeah
jealousass hoes yeah
and i know what i said bout bein in vogue
but just like that rb group from the 90s

one wrong call from your ex nigga sayin dumb shitll get him sent home
one call and my niggas ten toes

even if we gotta travel cross the globe
down to take you to the end of the road for real
