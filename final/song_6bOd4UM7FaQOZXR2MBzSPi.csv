oohooh ooh
oohooh ooh

verse 1
if changing my clothes would make you like me more
if changing my hair would make you care
then id grab the kitchen scissors
and cut myself to slivers
for you
if being more polite would keep you satisfied
if being less insane would make you stay
then id be more like my sister
say thank you maam and mister
to you for you

chorus
ive changed every part of me
until the puzzle pieces arent me at all
i look in the mirror now im just a jigsaw ahah ah
ah ahah
you take every part of me all of thе things you need
then the rest you discard
i look in thе mirror now im just a jigsaw ahah ah
ah ah ah
you might also likeverse 2
all i did just to make you happy
still you dont even fuckin love me
jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw
killin parts of myself to fit you
clear as shit i was not the issue
if i made you like me would i even like myself
pointin out all my flaws doesnt help

bridge
why dont you love me
dont you love me

chorus
ive changed every part of me
until the puzzle pieces arent me at all
i look in the mirror now im just a jigsaw ahah ah
ah ahah
you take every part of me all of the things you need
then the rest you discard
i look in the mirror now im just a jigsaw ahah ah
ah ah ah73embed"
