don’t let it go away
this feeling has got to stay
don’t let it go away

and i can’t believe i’ve had this chance now
don’t let it go away yeah

refrain
new you’re so new
you you’re new
and i never had this taste in the past
new you’re so new

verse
my normal hesitation is gone
and i really gravitate to your will
are you here to fetch me out
‘cause i’ve never had this taste in my mouth
oh you’re not old
and you’re not familiar
recently discovered and i’m learning about you

refrain
new you’re so new
you you’re new
and you’re consuming me violently
and your reverence shamelessly tempting me
who sent this maniac
‘cause i never had this taste in the past
