show me how to lie youre getting better all the time
and turning all against the one is an art thats hard to teach
another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
and as you step back into line a mob jumps to their feet

prechorus
now dance fucker dance man he never had a chance
and no one even knew it was really only you
and now you steal away take him out today
nice work you did youre gonna go far kid

chorus
with a thousand lies and a good disguise
hit em right between the eyes hit em right between the eyes
when you walk away nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes see em running for their lives

verse 2
slowly out of line and drifting closer in your sight
so play it out im wideawake its a scene about me
theres something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
and if you cant get what you want well its all because of me

prechorus
now dance fucker dance man i never had a chance
and no one even knew it was really only you
and now youll lead the way show the light of day
nice work you did youre gonna go far kid trust deceived

with a thousand lies and a good disguise
hit em right between the eyes hit em right between the eyes
when you walk away nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes see em running for their lives
