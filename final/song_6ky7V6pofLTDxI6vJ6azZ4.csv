ive been the needle and the thread
weaving figure eights and circles round your head
i try to laugh but cry instead
stretch my hands and feet to the corner of your bed

prechorus
fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

chorus
im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing til dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out

verse 2
this is not goodbye she said
it is just time for me to rest my head
she does not walk she runs instead
down these jagged streets and into my bed
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeprechorus
when i was fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

chorus
im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing til dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out
