til’ the day i die
i’d say lets get married
but that made you cry

i’ll bet on you darling
til’ the day we part
but i hope that i kick first cuz’ it’d break my little heart

i’ll bet on you sweetheart
like a game of cards
and if i lose my hand
i’m sure it’s worth the charge

to love and to loss
is worth the cost
so i’m wagering forever
just to be in your arms

chorus
i’m playing with fire
in the sense i feel warm
and i swear to fucking god i’ll weather the storms
i’m running the numbers
and counting the days
until you tack on my made up last name
you might also likeif this won’t convince you
to take on the part
my piano’s already wearing your name in a heart

if this overwhelms you
and you fade away
just please be kind i see my scar
every fucking day

you stitched up my forehead
and made my house home
now every chair i sit in it feels just like a throne

my words fail me daily
to show where i stand
but good god took a new meaning when you tattooed it on my hand

chorus
i’m playing with fire
in the sense i feel warm
and i swear to fucking god i’ll weather the storms
i’m running the numbers
and counting the days
until you tack on my made up last nameembed"
