verse
its november where the fuck is rod wave
young nigga way outta state
fucked up gettin over pain
look how far a nigga came
you remember i aint had a thing
fucked up walkin through the rain
at the top of the game shouldve seen the niggas i was tryna bring
its crazy the way these niggas change
tell the city girl chill you know baby mama know the deal
she know i could beat that pussy
okay lets switch the subject
notice that both of my wrists is flooded
i been grindin so hard gеttin to this money
i been working like i know the drought is coming
monday to monday sunday to sunday you know im street running
okay my daddy was a gangstеr what the fuck that made me
niggas claiming that its love dawg but it cant be
know i fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
and my pocket rocket on me homie dont reach
fuck dying in my cuban link im living in my richard millie
i just finished my tour what a wonderful feeling
i got inside my bag and got out my feelings
im out my feelings
