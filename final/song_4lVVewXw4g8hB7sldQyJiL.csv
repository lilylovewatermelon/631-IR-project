you lie an inch apart on your own continuum
now keep the freak show talk to a careful minimum
ill find a different harbor to lay my anchor in
and youll find a different way to keep from setting sail again no

chorus
but im still full of the love you want
still waking up beneath it all
and im still full of the love you want
i reach for you on faith alone

verse 2
seems your heart is locked up and i still get the combination wrong
or are you simply waiting to save your love for someone i am not
too many swallowed keys will make you bleed internally someday
oh oh oh oh
maybe you believe that in the end you will be better off that way
oh oh oh oh

chorus
and im still full of the love you want
still waking up beneath it all
and im still full of the love you want
i reach for you on faith alone
and im still full of the love you want
still waking up so alone
and ill be full of the love you want
no matter what forevermore
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likebridge
and im still full of the love you want
and im still full of the love you want
and im still full of the love you want
the love you want the love you want
and im still full of the love you want
and im still full of the love you want
and im still full of the love you want
the love you want the love you want
