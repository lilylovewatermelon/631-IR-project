change is inevitable
why hold on to what you have to let go of
like did i really break your heart
was it all my fault
if you dont knock it off
you know like i know where this was headed

hook 1
im a wanderer
im a wanderer baby
im a wanderer
im a wanderer

verse 2
lani kai was nice
turquoise seas and ocean breezes
loving you was nice
but its a new day a new season
i’ve been sad inside
and he could see it picked up your pieces
we are just alike
and alright alright alright

hook 2
he’s a wanderer
he’s a wanderer baby
he’s a wanderer
he’s a wanderer

i started as a love song
24 years in the making
moving from place to place and
i never really settled down
without a place to call home
i got so used to the changes
moving from stranger to strangest
you should face it
i am crazy

hook 1
im a wanderer
im a wanderer baby
im a wanderer
im a wanderer

bridge
shame on me for changing
no shame on you for staying the same
shame on me for changing
no shame on you for staying the same

hook 1
im a wanderer
im a wanderer baby
im a wanderer
im a wanderer
outro
maybe im just a wanderer
maybe im just a wanderer124embed"
