explain to me honestly who is she
tell me you dont love this girl
damn it boy whyd you go and ruin everything that i been livin for
is this where im supposed to turn my back
cry a tear and walk away
before i do a word to you you should know
know youve make a big mistake

chorus
why when where how who
what made you go off and do this crazy thing
thought i loved you good loved you all i could
never just for a ring
why when where how who
what made you go off and lose your mind this time
treated you so good but you knew i would
never just for a ring

verse 2
proud to say everyday that i stayed
very much in live with you
even though ill never know what its like
to hear you say the words i do

chorus
why when where how who
what made you go off and do this crazy thing
thought i loved you good loved you all i could
never just for a ring
why when where how who
what made you go off and lose your mind this time
treated you so good but you knew i would
never just for a ring

so no more holding hands
no kisses and no wedding plans
our love was just a lie
so now ill go an cry
oh why

chorus
why when where how who
what made you go off and do this crazy thing
thought i loved you good loved you all i could
never just for a ring
why when where how who
what made you go off and lose your mind this time
treated you so good but you knew i wouldembed"
