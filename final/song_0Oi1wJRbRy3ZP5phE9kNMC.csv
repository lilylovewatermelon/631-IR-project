i felt so inspired by what my teacher said
said id either be dead or be a reefer head
not sure if thats how adults should speak to kids
especially when the only thing i did was speak in class
ill teach his ass even betters what my uncle did
i pop my demo tape in start to beat my head
peeked out my eye see if he was beating his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searching for kicks like a sneakerhead
he gon keep pushing me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread
spread spread

had a couple of meetings no offers yet
maybe i aint good enough for these offices

i went from pauper to the president
cause every deal i ever made set precedent
