oh morning come bursting the clouds amen
lift off this blindfold let me see again
bring back the water let your ships roll in
in my heart she left a hole
the tightrope that i’m walking just sways and ties
the devil as hes talking with those angels eyes
and i just want to be there when the lightning strikes
and the saints go marching in

chorus
and sing
slow it down
through chaos as it swirls
its us against the world

verse 2
like a river to a raindrop i lost a friend
my drunken hazard daniel in a lions den
and tonight i know it all has to begin again
so whatever you do don’t let go
and if we could float away
fly up to the surface and just start again
lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
just erodes us in the rain
just erodes us and see roses in the rain saying

slow it down
slow it down
through chaos as it swirls
its us against the world

outro
through chaos as it swirls
its us against the world19embed"
