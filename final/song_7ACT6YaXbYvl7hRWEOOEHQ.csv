if you were here for the other night youd be terrified
you know i think the lines youre afraid of are all made up
ohoh ohoh ohoh
nobodys gonna regret this for you
if it dont make you smile oh
i watched your skeleton shake all evening
and bless your heart for tryin

prechorus
scary watchin it wearin off on me so fast
last night it was bad
she asked me come back and then i said

chorus
no problem ill send my location
she hit me four times i was in the whip before i knew it
dont cry when i feel your frustration
i wanna slow it down but nobody wouldve let me
if i couldve told her maybe if you feel out of place
its because you are
its because you are
its because you are
