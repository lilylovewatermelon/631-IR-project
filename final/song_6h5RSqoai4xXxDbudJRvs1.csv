success is the only thing i understand
head back home to the place i grew up
give my medals to the ones that i love
ill chase harvey through the door in the wall
he says never catch me never miss me at all
drool comes down from the corner of his mouth
i say i love you harvey you cut it out

i love winning baby i want it all
i wanna prove that i got the balls
harvey keeps on playing with his food
he doesnt understand what big boys do

he wakes up in the middle of the night
i run in and turn on the light
run my hands through his short black hair
i love you harvey i dont careyou might also like3embed"
