im leavin today
livin it leavin it to change

verse 1
slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
tongue tied and twisted are all my memories
celebrating a fantasy come true
packing all my bags finally on the move

chorus
im leavin today
im livin it oh im leavin it to change

verse 2
as im driving im captured by the view
so much beauty the road becomes my muse
the heat is rising and my hand surfs through the wind
cool calm collected is a child that lies within

chorus

im livin it oh im leavin it to change oh yeah
see im leavin today
oh yes im livin it oh im leavin it to change
but somehow ill miss it
i think ill really miss it one day yeah oh
