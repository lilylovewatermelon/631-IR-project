well ive been stuck in this town for so long
i thought i would go nuts
i dont know where im going
but i know that theres just too damn much


i want to leave this small city
and find out what them big towns have got
though when i show up there
there aint a whole lot more to spare than what i thought

prechorus
it aint better there or what youve heard
or whatever the hell you thought

chorus
in my hometown living life while im away
yeah my sound a radio in my driveway
theres no better day
i didnt even know it yet
impossible to forget
ill miss you when im gone
lord ill miss you when im gone

verse
as i walk through these neon lights
dont know where the hell i am tonight
just another big ol city
dont you think shes pretty
but im left here all alone

it aint better there or what you heard
or whatever the hell you thought

chorus
in my hometown living life while im away
yeah my sound a radio in my driveway
theres no better day
i didnt even know it yet
impossible to forget
ill miss you when im gone
lord ill miss you when im gone

bridge
and i think back talking trash and sitting on football fields
way after midnight talking bout how reckless we feel
i remember throwing rocks up at your window sill
oh how it feels

chorus
in my hometown living life while im away
my sound a radio in my driveway
theres no better day
i didnt even know it yet
impossible to forget
ill miss you when im gone
lord ill miss you when im goneembed"
