chorus booka600
i got two duffle bags and they handed from the teller
two bad bitches but they dead to me like callus
and im chasin all this money army green the color relish
pop pop they fall like feathers this watch is all baguettes
i got my hammer on me see his bitch and went to nailed her
bitch im with the gang that mean im hangin round some felons
and blow he got the k and he gon play it like a guitar
never have i hit a bitch that say she dont wanna fuck again

verse 1 lil durk
dont none of my diamonds be sis
i bought some cartiers just for my left eye
killin on the southside money on the westside
hustler i could sell popeyes to popeyes
i got it out the mud i aint never had shit
gang gang gang niggas know what it is
hermes rag when i wipe my tears
carat and carat shit in my ear
and i go johnny aint goin no veneers

and that shit scary
