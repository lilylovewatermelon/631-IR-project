i dont mind we have such a good time my best friend
but sometimes well i wish we could be more than friends
tell me do you know
tell me do you know
oh

i get so breathless when you call me name
ive often wondered do you feel the same
theres a chemistry energy a synchronicity when were all alone
so dont tell me you cant see what im thinking of

i can understand that you dont want to cross the line
and you know i cant promise you things will turn out fine
but i have to be honest i want you to be mine
tell me do you know
tell me do you know
oh

i get so breathless when you call me name
ive often wondered do you feel the same
theres a chemistry energy a synchronicity when were all alone
so dont tell me dont you tell me you cant see
oh

cause ive tried to do this right in your own time
ive been telling with my eyes my hearts on fire why dont you realize
tell me do you know
tell me do you know
