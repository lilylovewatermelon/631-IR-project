verse 1
sister girl i know you dont understand
but youre gonna have to understand hes my man now
what you had is gone our thing is sweet
our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me

your roots are dug up so you might as well give up
i see your intentions you cant handle the truth
he let you go a long time ago now its time to turn him loose
