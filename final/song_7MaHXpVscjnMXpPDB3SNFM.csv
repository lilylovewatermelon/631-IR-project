verse 1
i tear the shrink wrap off and put the needle down
fill my bedroom up with a cash song
and crank it up loud
because it makes me feel good
got the pedal pecked hard and the mustang drive
horses screamin at me
momma prayin that ill make it home alive
but it makes me feel good yeah

prechorus 1
like sneakin out late
tellin white lies
stealin one more kiss tonight

chorus
i try my best to behave
and i cant help feelin this way
its not my fault so dont blame me
cause love makes me
and is it some kind of fiction
or the sweetest addiction
