days seem sometimes as if theyll never end
sun digs its heels to taunt you
but after sunlit days one thing stays the same
rises the moon
days fade into a watercolour blur
memories swim and haunt you
but look into the lake shimmering like smoke
rises the moon

chorus
ohoh close your weary eyes
i promise you that soon the autumn comes
to darken fading summer skies
breathe breathe breathe

verse 2
days pull you down just like a sinking ship
floating is getting harder
but tread the water child and know that meanwhile
rises the moon
days pull you up just like a daffodil
uprooted from its garden
theyll tell you what you owe but know even so
rises the moon
you might also likechorus
youll be visited by sleep
i promise you that soon the autumn comes
to steal away each dream you keep
breathe breathe breathe33embed"
