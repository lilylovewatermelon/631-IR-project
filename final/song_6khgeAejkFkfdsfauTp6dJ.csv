verse 1
this is what i wish for those and all they know
could depend on how coward i should act
from hell or does come it from within
if she wont give me the love i came here for
with pen i am armed here to react

chorus
hey now hey now what is it boy
all the things that trouble you
so visit your mirror image
of what might have once behaved
hey now hey now what is it boy
but i wont rest til dead til dead do you part

verse 2
this is how i feel my god from whats been dealt
the flies that flutter fight tonight
from hell or does come it from within
is it love that im feeling or is this hate the same
the emotions enough to kill the sane

chorus
hey now hey now what is it boy
all the things that trouble you
so visit your mirror image
of what might have once behaved
hey now hey now what is it boy
besides i only hope you know that i love you
oh i hope
you might also likepostchorus
feed little maggots off the west side of your sin
run little maggot til they learn of what you did
feed little maggots off the west side of your sin
run little maggot til they learn of what you did

interlude
feliz sería a qué hora
feliz sería a qué hora
feliz sería a qué hora
feliz sería a qué hora

verse 3
from start to finish ive made you feel this
uncomfort in turn with the world youve learned
to love through this hate to live with its weight
a burden discerned in the blood you taste

bridge
why would you deny me answers
if im just a boy on the break of being
horror and hell through its fires
be brutally honest was it better before me
the curve of your body
how i want how i want her with me
the truth of the story
the vishual i wish you all
part iii

bridge
the better end of all to come
the truth be now here one by one
i am to you extend to none
the memory to fuel the fire

guitar solo

verse 3
watching his tale with the words he unfolds
conscience and cold wed never know
they scream as he laughs off the dust from his eyes
these worlds will now learn of the dreams in his mind

chorus
could this be that hard for me
to configure a new love in hate
to my new entity
or banish it home to the grave
no one is safe

verse 4
with the quickness strike out for the less of us doubt
the mercy of the man who put the pen in our mouth
word write us well signed forgiveness for sale
im through being full of all the might you want killed
the fiction will see the real
the answer will question still
in your body to blood as your parents once wept
you will follow their lead one by one every step
chorus
could this be that hard for me
to configure a new love in hate
to my new entity
or banish it home to the grave
i will not save

outro
your world
your world to the end of you
your world
your world1embed"
