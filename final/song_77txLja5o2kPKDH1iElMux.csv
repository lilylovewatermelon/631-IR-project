as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out of my chest
i keep searching for something that i never seem to find
but maybe i wont because i left it all behind
now im stuck with this and thatll never change
always a part of me until the very last day
where to go from here what road to travel on
i spent my whole life choosing and it always chose wrong
will i try to have the will to be alive
will i try cause ive never seen the light
lowered to the ground and its now you see
you spent your whole life taking the best of me

chorus danny
whered you go wheres your home
howd you end up all alone
can you hear me now
theres no light theres no sound
hard to breathe when youre underground
can you hear me now
hear me now

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
how long can i keep pretending to be
that all the stars in the sky could mean something to me
heaven will open up if i live on my knees
a man of many words but a man of few deeds
walking these streets so absent of hope
a pillow of concrete a man with no home
lend him a hand then were walking away
leave the virtue of pity but we live with the shame
so scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
when you wake up you know its darker than last night
quickly we forget sacrifice gone by
born to walk away been walking my whole life

whered you go wheres your home
howd you end up all alone
can you hear me now
theres no light theres no sound
hard to breathe when youre underground
can you hear me now
hear me now

bridge danny
look into my eyes and i see what do i see
nothing at all
take another look around me what do i see
nothing at all

chorus danny
whered you go wheres your home
howd you end up all alone
can you hear me now
theres no light theres no sound
hard to breathe when youre underground
can you hear me now
hear me now
can you hear me hear me now16embed"
