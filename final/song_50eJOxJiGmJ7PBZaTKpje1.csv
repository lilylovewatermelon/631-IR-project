okay screaming when we fuck screaming when we fight yeah
even when im drunk youre my only type yeah
please dont break my heart i know that you might yeah
tell me tell me now are you bout that life yeah
bonnie and clyde ready to die
two gravesites later tonight

backstroke we both naked

yeah i love chaos i love toxic
i love wreckage i love falling

its hard lately im exhausted
you hate my guts then you love me
you make me feel so disgusting
cant stop a runner from running
so go go go

fighting then we fuck youre my only type yeah
mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and hennessey
