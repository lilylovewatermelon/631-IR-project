maybe i need some rehab
or maybe just need some sleep
i got a sick obsession
im seein it in my dreams
im lookin down every alley
im makin those desperate calls
im stayin up all night hopin
hittin my head against the wall

prechorus
what youve got boy is hard to find
i think about it all the time
im all strung out my heart is fried
i just cant get you off my mind

because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love

verse 2
wont listen to any advice
mommas tellin me i should think twice
but left to my own devices
im addicted its a crisis
my friends think ive gone crazy
my judgments gettin kinda hazy
my steeze is gonna be affected
if i keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
