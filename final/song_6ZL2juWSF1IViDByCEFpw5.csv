im on the brink i can barely think
with all of these thoughts runnin through my head
wonderin if i did you wrong
no way i did you wrong

verse 2
every night i try to justify
all the angry things i said
oh but i cant take em back no i cant do that
i was wrong oh but now youre gone

chorus
and i cant hide what i feel inside
and just stop lovin you even if i wanted to
i cant hold on but lettin go
is somethin i cant do is somethin i cant do
even if i wanted to

verse 3
all the times i sat and watched you cry
when i shouldve held you close made sure that you know
how much i cared but i was never there
i was wrong and now youve moved on

chorus
i cant hide what i feel inside
and just stop lovin you even if i wanted to
i cant hold on but lettin go
is somethin i cant do is somethin i cant do
even if i wanted to
even if i wanted to
