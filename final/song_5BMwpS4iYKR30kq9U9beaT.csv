city of stars
are you shining just for me
city of stars
theres so much that i cant see
who knows
i felt it from the first embrace i shared with you
that now our dreams
theyve finally come true

verse 2 mia
city of stars
just one thing everybody wants
there in the bars
and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
its love
yes all were looking for is love from someone else

chorus sebastian mia  both
a rush a glance
a touch a dance
a look in somebodys eyes
to light up the skies
to open the world and send it reeling
a voice that says ill be here
and youll be alright
i dont care if i know
just where i will go
cause all that i need is this crazy feeling
a rattattat on my heart
think i want it to stay
