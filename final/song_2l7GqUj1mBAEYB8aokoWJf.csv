i can feel it in the way your blood and heart beats
my bodys cold and it thinks that im already gone
or is it in the way your body moves
id like to tell you but i think that you already know
the words i drag out from your mouth speak
so listen up world listen up world
in her vision i have given company
they see no evil in leading their bodies from home

chorus
believer youll leave her in leaving them all
no but i dont buy it
like anything you do as anyone you are
ten speed if i must then i must
believer youll leave her in leaving them all
no but i dont buy it
like anything you do as anyone you are

prechorus

verse 2
if written wrote me even chance and the choice to save you
i wouldnt answer if it even had to ask
in her figure ive instilled a taste of my own
so listen up world listen up world
to make it easier to take what life im owed
as the curse has returned from the hell of your heart and your soul
