well its time to move along i guess
everything i love i leave behind
standin in a field out west
one thing on my heart one on my mind
she rolls like the thunder flies like the wind
out where the river dont end
ive burned all the bridges left in my life
aint comin back again

chorus
this cowboys all alone
ridin down that old twolane
the whiskey goes down slow
so close your eyes and grab the reins
all thе miles and the tears through thе long hard years
like a dust storm im headin north
spent my life chasin a wild wild horse

verse 2
was born into a lifelong curse
she whispers in my ear late every night
the liquor doesnt quench my thirst
it doesnt change a thing how hard i fight
shes cold as a winter out on the plains
like footsteps on frozen ground
nothing can break no one can tame
somethin that cant be found

this cowboys all alone
ridin down that old twolane
the whiskey goes down slow
so close your eyes and grab the reins
all the miles and the tears through the long hard years
like a dust storm im headin north
spent my life chasin a wild wild horse

bridge
twentytwo years ridin back and forth
i threw it all away on a wild horse

chorus
this cowboys all alone
ridin down that old twolane
whiskey goes down slow
close your eyes and grab the reins
all the miles and the tears through the long hard years
like a dust storm im headin north
spent my life chasin oh a wild wild horse

outro
its time to move along i guess
everything i love i leave behindembed"
