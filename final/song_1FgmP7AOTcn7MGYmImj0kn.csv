verse 1 macklemore
open up the doors on em we playin tonight
bring on the marchin band and turn on the stadium lights
they gon learn from me this is our church of the
life of a champion ugh so freddie mercury
sneakin into hov concerts in nosebleeds
the hov bein like whoa
yeah independent keep killin these people and dont sleep
even the pigeontoed still standin on both feet you know
its obvious whose night this is
grandparents immigrants couple irish kids
victory in my grasp gotta fight for this
the streets are ours this evening goin undefeated
i roll the dice against the staircase uh huh
steak season gotta marinate uh huh
if i happen to die tonight put my spirit in the stars
bury me in the grave and carve the history was ours

verse 2 macklemore
wake up bitch i aint dead yet
and if i was in heaven id be the best dressed
my closet lookin like a swap meet in texas
and maybe its excess but
we aint cut from the same cloth player
talkin to a boss player
checks like a ball player
easy money all layups
i be pissin off neighbors
get up off my dick and get the finger like a crossfader
i be in my lawn chair star gazin like woo
all praise to the most high
your boy in his own js i made it to courtside
remember the old days and playin for cosigns
when labels offer me pay i said that i wont sign
i took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
and when everybody doubted me i turned that to my leverage
so i stand up on the stage it wasnt planned see it was destined
look at fiftythousand people with their hands into the heavens
said i—
chorus eric nally
i aint gonna die tonight
you cant kill me not my spirit no
history is ours tonight

bridge eric nally
didnt come this far to lose
wont let death make a move
might not mean much to you but id die for this w
let my life be something to prove
every scrape every fight every cut every bruise
ill lay it all on the line ill rewrite these rules
victory in my sight i will not lose

chorus eric nally
i aint gonna die tonight
you cant kill me not my spirit no
history is ours tonight
the people are chantin cant you hear it
