well i heard you crying loud
all the way across town
youve been searching for that someone and its me out on the prowl
as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
well dont get lonely now
and dry your whining eyes
im just roamin for the moment sleazin my backyard so dont get
so uptight youve been thinking about ditching me

chorus
no time to search the world around
cause you know where ill be found
when i come around

verse 2
oh i heard it all before
so dont knock down my door
im a loser and a user so i dont need no accuser
to try and slag me down because i know youre right
so go do what you like
make sure you do it wise
you may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing was ever there
you cant go forcing something if its just not right

chorus
no time to search the world around
cause you know where ill be found
when i come around

chorus
no time to search the world around
cause you know where ill be found
when i come around

outro
when i come around
when i come around
