god save me im fucked up yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
ignoring my problems yeyeyeyeyeyeah

more plaques for their office

verse 1
um sixteen years old kicked out the home
sixteen years old out on the street
cant reconcile both of my parents are gone
i wanna talk to my dad but rest in peace
last month took a gun in the room alone
last month almost blew my head off
she screamеd and i never put down the phonе
i gotta be somewhere please hang up

prechorus
now smile for the camera
breakups are entertaining
my mental imbalance
mixed with the drugs create me

chorus
its a good night its a good night to be high
sober again sober again its a lie
therapy said therapy said that i might
do it again do it again and die
im a lost boy im a lost boy
shes a goth girl shes a pop girl
i know a one way i know a one way
to a lost world to a lost world

okay
spaceships in the sky we are not alone
i went out to the desert and i saw the lights
say hi cause the government tapped the phone
fuck cops read me my miranda rights
poison the brain follow along
theyll make the rules for no reason
run away go find where you belong
and dont tell no one youre leaving

prechorus
now smile for the camera
breakdowns are entertaining
my mental imbalance
mixed with the drugs create me

chorus
its a good night its a good night to be high
sober again sober again its a lie
