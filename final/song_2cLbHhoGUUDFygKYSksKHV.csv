z71 headlights shining through the trees
the boys spill out of the backseat
and ask me what’s it gonna be tonight

i said i’m just trying to get loose trying to make a move
don’t matter what we do

as long we’re out there somewhere
where we can go
get away from it all get lost
and god only knows
where we’ll go
and hell i don’t care
as long we’re out there

we pulled in threw it in park
and followed the orange glow in the dark in the trail marks
through the fire and flames we locked eyes
she walked over from the other side and smiled
when i said

i’m just trying to get loose trying to set the mood
don’t matter what we do yeah what we do

as long as we‘re out there somewhere
where we can go
get away from it all get lost
and god only knows
where well go
and baby i don’t care
as long we’re out there
as long we’re out there
yeah
