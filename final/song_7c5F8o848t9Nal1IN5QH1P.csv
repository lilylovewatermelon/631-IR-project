i had a dream i had a dream i was flying over all of us there were so many pretty people so many pretty faces i talked to some birds i fell in love again and none of this ever ended everything just kept going and going and going and even when you laughed you cried and even when you were sad you were really happy cause you were here and i got to meet every star every planet everything that made me and we all kissed and became the same we became the same we became the same

verse 1
who would have thought this we almost lost it
when you lie inside darkness its hard to see
and we sleep in tradition keep em off in the distance
to tell you that i havent been

prechorus
we are all cold water
why try at all why bother

chorus
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling

verse 2
who would have dreamed this you couldnt mean this
it would be some type of meanness to where you are
cause i dont know where to go
and no one else seems to know

prechorus
we are all knights fallen
why try at all dark calling
so were left alone no one left to call upon
be still my broken bones as i travel on
you might also likechorus
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
so were left alone no one left to call upon
be still my broken bones as i travel on
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
