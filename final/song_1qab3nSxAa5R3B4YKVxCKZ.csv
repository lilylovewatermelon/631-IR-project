i see you walking home alone your face is alive and bright
but you cant see how weak you are cause i could end it tonight
its the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching you
well i can tell you now that someone is me and im about to make it right

chorus
why do you take it all
why do i beg for more
i never thought that this is how id hit the floor
why do you take it all
why do i beg for more
i never thought that this is how id
hit the floor

verse 2
i creep up from behind touch your neck move down your spine
you take a look and breathe so sharp
just a matter of time
dont scream i ask of you but then you let one out so now its time to go
i come down on you like a ton of brick
all over so its time to go

chorus
why do you take it all
why do i beg for more
i never thought that this is how id hit the floor
why do you take it all
why do i beg for more
i never thought that this is how id hit the floor
hit the floor
