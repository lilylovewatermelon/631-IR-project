bring it on back back to square one
i was a no good lying two time one lining
backwards son of a gun
tell me your name and honey where are you from
ive been going to this bar for too damn long
and i aint seen you once
who you here with and baby do you have a man at home
cause if you aint got one and you want to have some fun
i got a place we can go

prechorus
ill be three sheets to the wind when the lights come on
when the lights come on
i got a motel room and a bottle of booze that we can put our names on
we can put our names on

chorus
cause im just looking for a one time thing
i dont want four years and a ring
bеcause it all just feels the same
whеn im looking for a one time thing
im looking for a one time thing
i dont care if youre gone the next day
because it all just feels the same
when im looking for a one time thing
you might also likeverse
i take it all back every single word that i said
maybe youve got second thoughts in your mind
maybe you want to stay instead
aw hell an baby youre the one
youre the one that ive been looking for
it was a one night stand after all
you can stay or you can go

prechorus
well i was way to drunk last night to tell the truth
to tell the truth
you know the sober mind does your body fine when im looking at you
when im looking at you

chorus
cause i aint looking for a one time thing
maybe i want four years and a ring
because it all dont feel the same
when im looking for a one time thing
i aint looking for a one time thing
maybe i care if youre gone the next day
because it all dont feel the same
when im looking for a one time thing

outro
well if you leave me now i guess im fine with that
and it really dont help that she aint called me back
cause ill just bring it on back
back to square one
been going to this bar for too damn long
and i aint seen you onceembed"
