i could use a bad disguise
to guard me in the darkest nights
i keep finding my way to the harshest words
ive got a strange strange vision

chorus
of a reckless love
standing in a world of my own
they call it reckless love

verse 2
so give me a chance to remember
what ive given up to defend you
i would burn my dreams away
just to stand in the thankless shadows

chorus
of your reckless love
standing in a world of my own
they call it reckless love

keyboard solo

standing on the other side of your reckless love
see bleachers liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
thinking on the other side of your reckless love
get out
stand back
if you dont let go youre gonna break me
and you get out
stand back
if you dont let go youre gonna break me
and you get out
stand back
if you dont let go youre gonna break me
and you get out
stand back
if you dont let go youre gonna break me

verse 3
so give me a chance to remember
what ive given up to defend you
i have burned my dreams away

outro
to stand in the broken shadows
of your reckless love
your thankless love
your restless love
a thankless love
your reckless love
its a thankless love
your reckless love
your reckless love4embed"
