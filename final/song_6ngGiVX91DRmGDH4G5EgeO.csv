i never get lonely
i got these ghosts to keep me company
i took the rearview off of this old ford so i only see in front of me
now the past is out of sight and out of mind
swore i changed now im back chasing these white lines

chorus
im just a longhaired son of a sinner
searching for new ways i can get gone
im a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
cause im only one drink away from the devil
im only one call away from home
yeah im somewherе in the middle
i guess im just a littlе
right and wrong

verse 2
these backroads got me
these pills pretend to be my friend
im done for the last time
im lying to myself again
i always say that
now im on my way back here somehow
i should know by now

im just a longhaired son of a sinner
searching for new ways i can get gone
im a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
cause im only one drink away from the devil
im only one call away from home
yeah im somewhere in the middle
i guess im just a little
right and wrong

bridge
mistakes i made i paid for them in cash
walked a million miles on broken glass
im feeling like im fading
my hearts been slowing breaking
might pop a pill and smoke and maybe drink
talk to god and tell him what i think
at first hes gonna hate me
but eventually hell save me

chorus
im just a longhaired son of a sinner
searching for new ways i can get gone
im a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
cause im only one drink away from the devil
im only one call away from home
yeah im somewhere in the middle
i guess im just a little
right and wrongembed"
