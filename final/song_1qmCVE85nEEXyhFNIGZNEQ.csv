i feel like a blind man trying to make a start
and i don’t know no i don’t know where i’m gonna go

i’ve seen the sun come up a mile off the ground
flew back the other way and saw it go back down
i know the days change but always seem the same
i’ll take the best of what i can from my mistakes
and now i know now i know

i can’t go wrong
as long as i remember where i’m from
hold my head up just to keep it clear
i want a chance just to face my fear face my fear

never mind all the times that i just couldn’t wait
i can’t remember when it all began to change
watching the grass grow and die
from summer to fall
it’s funny how a year passes by and you don’t notice at all
well i know i know

i can’t go wrong
as long as i remember where i’m from
hold my head up just to keep it clear
i want a chance just to face my fear face my fearsee phillip phillips liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
