verse 1
never really wanted to talk about it
fuck it though im bout to talk about it
something told me write a song about it
we probably aint gonna get along about it
i froze up when i seen you with him
that shit made me want to leave you with him
i never even cheated god damn girl i shouldve cheated
and i aint fucking with these bitches these bitches be eating
and i dont want to be a player you gave me a reason
fucked some bitch the other day i wanted to get even

outro
bought my new bitch a chanel bag and she went and told her friends about it
i cut my old bitch off she so mad and i know she still think about me
no new niggas always so mad circle shining like a ring with diamonds
i keep some gangsta niggas with me know that if you even try to think about it
if they catch a body i swear i will never speak about it
