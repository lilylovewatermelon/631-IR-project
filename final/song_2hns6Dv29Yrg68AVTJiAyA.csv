verse 1
you took my hand you showed me how
you promised me youd be around
uhhuh thats right
i took your words and i believed
in everything you said to me
yeahhuh thats right

chorus
if someone said three years from now
youd be long gone
id stand up and punch them out
cause theyre all wrong
i know better cause you said forever
and ever who knew

verse 2
remember when we were such fools
and so convinced and just too cool
oh no no no
i wish i could touch you again
i wish i could still call you friend
id give anything

i was all wrong
they knew better still you said forever
and ever who knew
