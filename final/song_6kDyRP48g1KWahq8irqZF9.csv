someone crashed the party baby
someone left the light on
someone tipped the bottle over
and now all the wines gone

chorus
but how sweet sweet sweet
itd be be be
just to dream dream dream
next to me me me
you speak speak speak
youre asleep sleep sleep
not to me me me
not to me me me

verse 2
someones on the bathroom tiles
someonеs in the backyard
someone ran homе emptyhanded
someone bagged the rockstar

chorus
but how sweet sweet sweet
itd be be be
just to dream dream dream
next to me me me
you speak speak speak
youre asleep sleep sleep
not to me me me
