you hurt me bad this time no coming back
and i cried til i couldnt cry another heart attack
if i lay on the floor maybe ill wake up
and i dont pick up when you call cause your voice is a gun
every word is a bullet hole shot a hole in the sun
if i never look up maybe ill never notice

chorus
and you you want forgiveness
but i i just cant do it yet

verse 2
theres still a thread that runs from your body to mine
and you cant break what you dont see an invisible line
if i follow it down will we just be alright
but it could take me all your life to learn to love
how i thought i could love someone i havent even begun
if its all up to us we might as well give up

chorus
and you you want forgiveness
i can barely hang on to myself
but i i cant give you that
i cant give you i cant give you that
and you you want forgiveness
im afraid that ill have nothing left
but i i just cant do it yet
i cant do i just cant do it yet
see paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also likebridge
dont you go and get it twisted
forgiving is not forgetting
dont you go and get it twisted
forgiving is not forgetting
no its not forgetting
no ill never forget it no

chorus
and you you want forgiveness
i can barely hang on to myself
but i i cant give you that
i cant give you i cant give you that
and you you want forgiveness
im afraid that ill have nothing left
but i i just cant do it yet
i cant do i just cant do it yet7embed"
