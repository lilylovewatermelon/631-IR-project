its not fair i found love
it made me say that get back
youll never see daylight
if im not strong it just might
its not fair i found love
it made me say that get back
youll never see daylight
if im not strong it just might

verse 1 ruby da cherry
they figure me a dead motherfucker
but im just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
snow leopard with the lead in his head turnin me into a sweater
bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
i be the silhouette of a sunset
smoke a cigarette while i compress my depression
stare into the violet fluorescent lights makes me violent
im tryna get the highest i can get before i overdose and die
my ribs are nothing but an empty cage black hole in my chest
big bang yung plague on the tip of a wave
in my head i feel like im a guest so ima throw it all away
because when i am dead i will be nothing decomposin in a grave
im matter but i dont matter
i can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
brain splattered on the wall
grey stains wont dissolve gonna have to paint it all

its not fair i found love
it made me say that get back
youll never see daylight
if im not strong it just might

verse 2 lick loth
always boasting my emotions on how im so fucking broken
think im joking when im talkin about blowing my head open
til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
wrists slit thoughts of licky falling in an open pit shit
always burn my bridges cause id rather fall in ditches
if lifes a game of inches then my dick has been the biggest
and my goals to fuck the world until that motherfuckers twitchin
lane switchin same mission to die and blame my addiction bitch
chorus butterfly boucher
its not fair i found love
it made me say that get back
youll never see daylight
if im not strong it just might351embed"
