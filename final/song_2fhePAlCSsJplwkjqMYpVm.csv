hold on until the end
hold on til you cant extend
i be clinging on to you

and then begin again
orbiting around and then
cycle back around to you
coming back around to you
im coming back around and
even on your worst day
love you in the worst way worst way
circling around for eternity
going through the motions youre turning me eternally
drifting on my own again
reaching out to hold your hand
i want to be alone with you
can i be alone with you can i be alone with you
can i be alone with you
