we came out of the cinema
we were rubbing our eyes
our mouths were dry from the sugar and the popcorn
and we felt a little guilty
about spending that whole sunny day inside
the movie we were watching
about bonnie and clyde
they were driving down a backroad
they thought they were home free
the police knew they were coming
they were hiding in the trees
and they shot them down
one hundred and thirty rounds
they shot them down

chorus
so we might as well say
whats on our minds
cause theres no way to know
when its your time to go
when its your time to go

verse 2
later we were walking on the streets of monterey
the trees beside the water
reminded you of childhood holidays
hey babe i know the way
to a little stretch of beach
where we could lose ourselves
see vance joy liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus
dont matter where youve been
you jump into the water and you come out clean
dont matter where youve been
you jump into this water and you come out clean

chorus
so we might as well say
whats on our minds
cause theres no way to know
when its your time to go
when its your time to go
theres no way to know

outro
dont matter where youve been
you jump into the water and you come out clean
dont matter where youve been
