how does it feel being in these arms
whats it really like to be loved
ive been alone now how long
have you ever loved the way that i have
and i have often wondered who
who could love you the way i do

chorus
now i just want you to know
how im touched deep in my soul
just being with you
and i need you more each day
baby if youre still awake
call me when you get this

verse 2
ive got all this poetry now i didnt know then i kept inside
guess i had never seen anything beautiful
till i first saw you asleep at night
and i have often wondered who
who could love you the way i do

chorus
now i just want you to know
how im touched deep in my soul
just being with you
and i need you more each day
baby if youre still awake
call me when you get this

and i have been cautious and ive tried to keep to myself but who could love you the way i do

now i just want you to know
how im touched deep in my soul
just being with you
so much more each day

just being with you
and i need you need you more each day
if youre still awake
