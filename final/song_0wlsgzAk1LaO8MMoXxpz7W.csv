and you dont seem to understand
a shame you seemed an honest man
and all the fears you hold so dear
will turn to whisper in your ear
and you know what they say might hurt you
and you know that it means so much
and you dont even feel a thing

minichorus
i am falling
i am fading
i have lost it all

verse 2
and you dont seem the lying kind
a shame that i can read your mind
and all the things that i read there
candlelit smile that we both shared
and you know i dont mean to hurt you
but you know that it means so much
and you dont even feel a thing

chorus
i am falling
i am fading
i am drowning
help me to breathe
i am hurting
i have lost it all
i am losing
help me to breathe
