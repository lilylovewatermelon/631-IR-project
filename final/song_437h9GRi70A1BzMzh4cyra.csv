we came here on his back and we caught your eye
the salty ocean wind made the seagulls cry
the rocking of his house had me holding on
but i knew that i was safe from there on out

verse 1 nanna
and the waves that hit his face marked the past
and the the furrows on his skin oh how time goes fast

chorus nanna  ragnar þórhallsson
and we are far from home
but were so happy
far from home all alone
but were so happy
