everything inside of me is burning up for you to see

some people do it by the book but i prefer to go by feel

verse 2 anthony kiedis
the spirit of a dragons tear is lovely at this time of year
the cave within your mountainside is deeper than it will be wide

conveyer belts are moving and i want you to be sure of that
