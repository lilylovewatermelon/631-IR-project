marvin walked into a helpless land
and wondered lightly am i happy
is this happy
following the footsteps left by man
he stepped to reprimand the mystic
so sadistic
took a step into the elevator
who said guess ill see you later
dont you worry
fifteen flights that lasted nights
and days that spent without a cent for creatures
with their beat shirts

prechorus
listening to painted whispered
light on top forgotten hill

verse 2
next the stranded senate of the white brick house
with flowers asked some questions
for their story
all feeling now he took his bow
and left the stage of time with no answers
to no questions
lonely paperbacks that wanted
just a taste of feeling to implode them
before living
tiptoed to that wooden sign that said
now take your place in line for happy
this is lovely
you might also likeprechorus
listening to painted whispered
light on top forgotten hill

chorus
one secondary smile to go that extra mile
to make me feel today to make it go away
the chemistry is gone taken for a ride
far away from you no longer left inside

verse 3
the actor with his world renown
was thinking bout his last real day of silence
was it over
or is it just we all think that our answer
isnt real its just a picture
of a letter
bumble mumble make the rounds
no matter what youll seem profound
its useless just to worry
something normal happens somewhere
far away in clouds so please stop thinking
this is happy

prechorus
listening to painted whispered
light on top forgotten hill
chorus
one secondary smile to go that extra mile
to make me feel today to make it go away
the chemistry is gone taken for a ride
far away from you no longer left inside
one secondary smile to go that extra mile
to make me feel today to make it go away
the chemistry is gone taken for a ride
far away from you no longer left inside

outro
therere no secrets in the door
just a moment doing chores dont look so sad
and theres something and theres something
and theres something and theres something
next to nothing
and theres something and theres something
but youre gone13embed"
