when you when you forget your name
when old faces all look the same

prechorus
meet me in the morning when you wake up
meet me in the morning then youll wake up

if only i dont bend and break
ill meet you on the other side ill meet you in the light
if only i dont suffocate
ill meet you in the morning when you wake

verse 2
bitter and hardened heart
oh aching waiting for life to start

prechorus
meet me in the morning when you wake up
meet me in the morning then youll wake up

chorus
if only i dont bend and break
ill meet you on the other side ill meet you in the light
if only i dont suffocate
ill meet you in the morning when you wake
