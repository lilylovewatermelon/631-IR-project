verse
before i leave the house i tell my bitch that i love her
but thats not til i pop a pill now its fuck her
thats some shit i cant risk shes an actress
she just wanna love me i swear its a habit

hang with the demons they dancin
dont dyke with my dyson dont cap on the fashion i know
my bitch with the extras
