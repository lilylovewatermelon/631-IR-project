for once i wanna be the car crash
not always just the traffic jam
hit me hard enough to wake me
and lead me wild to your dark roads

prechorus

oohooh oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh oohooh

chorus
headlights before me
so beautiful so clear
reach out and take it
cause im so tired of all this fear

verse 2
my tongue is lost so i cant tell you
please just see it in my eyes
i pull up thorns from our ripped bodies
and let the blood fall in my mouth

prechorus
oohooh oohooh oohooh
