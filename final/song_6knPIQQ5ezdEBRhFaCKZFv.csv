this old bar stools feeling higher
as i started sinking lower
the minute that she waltzed right through that door
not long ago i held her
like a fool i went and left her
now shes with somebody new out on that floor

chorus
and shes got the rhythm and i got the blues
and shes showing me how much i had to lose
with her every little move shes telling me im over you
shes got the rhythm and i got the blues
yeehaw

verse 2
well that musics getting louder
as my heart keeps beating faster
and she spells out regret in perfect time
well i thought i wanted freedom
but that ball and chain i need em
but when you choose sometimes you lose the prize

chorus
cause shes got the rhythm and i got the blues
and shes showing me how much i had to lose
with her every little move shes telling me im over you
shes got the rhythm and i got the blues
yeah with her every little move shes telling me im over you
shes got the rhythm
and i got the bluessee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
