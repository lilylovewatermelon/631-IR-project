ive heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you dont really care for music do ya
well it goes like this
the fourth the fifth the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

verse 2 avi
well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to the kitchen chair
she broke your throne and shе cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallеlujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

verse 3 kirstin mitch  scott
well baby ive been here before
ive seen this room and ive walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew ya
and ive seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victry march a victry march
its a cold and its a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

well maybe theres a god above
but all ive ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
and its not a cry that you hear at night
its not somebody whos seen the light
its a cold and its a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

outro all
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujahembed"
