i thought that i was dreamin when you said you love me
the start of nothin
i had no chance to prepare i couldnt see you comin
the start of nothin
ooh i could hate you now
its quite alright to hate me now
when we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

verse 1
if i could see through walls i could see youre faking
if you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didnt give a fuck back then
i aint a kid no more
well never be those kids again
wed drive to syds
had the x6 back then back then
no matter what i did my waves wouldnt dip back then
everything sucked back then we were friends

chorus
i thought that i was dreamin when you said you love me
the start of nothin
i had no chance to prepare i couldnt see you comin
the start of nothin
ooh i could hate you now
its quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you aint a kid no more well never be those kids again
its not the same ivorys illegal dont you remember

bridge
i broke your heart last week
youll probably feel better by the weekend
still remember had you going crazy
screamin my name the feeling deep down is good

chorus
i thought that i was dreamin when you said you love me
the start of nothin
had no chance to prepare couldnt see you comin
and we started from nothin
ooh i could hate you now
its alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

outro
all the things i didnt mean to say i didnt mean to do
there were things you didnt need to say did you mean to mean to
ive been dreamin of you dreamin of you
ive been dreamin of you dreamin of you
ive been dreamin dreamin208embed"
