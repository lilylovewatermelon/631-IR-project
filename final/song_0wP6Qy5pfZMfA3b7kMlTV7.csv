in a purple neon glow in some downtown bar
in a whiskey shot or a cigarette smoke ring heart
even down six feet in a dead tired sleep
i guess im destined to toss and turn

chorus
i see you even with my eyes closed blindfolded
in a rain the world aint seen since noah
every breath every dream
youre here youre there youre inbetween
every sidewalk crack every song i hear
looking past jesus on the dash or in the rear view mirror
every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
i see you even with my eyes closed

verse 2
on a dustfilled lost road in some noname town
a thousand miles from home with me holding you now
call it blessed call it cursed it heals and it hurts
i guess im destined to toss and turn

chorus
i see you even with my eyes closed blindfolded
and a rain the world aint seen since noah
every breath every dream
youre here youre there youre inbetween
every sidewalk crack every song i hear
looking past jesus on the dash in the rear view mirror
every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
i see you even with my eyes closed
i see you even with my eyes closed

chorus
i see you even with my eyes closed blindfolded

every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
