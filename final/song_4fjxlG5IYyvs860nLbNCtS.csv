timothy cause it’s such a waste
timothy we found your spaceship
timothy it’s the farthest you’ve ever flown
never used your head
to find out what this whole thing meant
it’s not what it seems
but it is
timothy where have you been
timothy where have you been

timothy where did you go
timothy the boy can throw
timothy we found your spaceship
timothy did it hurt when you hit the ground
never used your legs
to walk ‘round in this whole big mess

it’s not what it seems
but it is
timothy where have you been
she cried in the kitchen
to let you go
timothy where have you been
you might also likemissed your photo
missed your birthday too
missed your photo

it’s not what is seems
but it is
timothy where have you been
she cried in the kitchen
to let you go
timothy where have you been

missed your photo
missed your birthday too
missed your photoembed"
