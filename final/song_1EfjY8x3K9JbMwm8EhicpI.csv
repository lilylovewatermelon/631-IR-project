time doesnt erase
the demons you dont see
dragging up all the ways
temptations overgrown
truth is karma dont lie
cant keep me here in the dark
ill set you off like a spark
cant shake me down to the bone
ill turn you back into stone
into oblivion

the demons you dont see
still dancin in your dreams
dragging up all the ways
temptations overgrown
looks like were all alone

truth is karma dont lie
so let me show you why

behold the alchemy
crawling out of my skin
shed every trace of you
just one last thing to prove
