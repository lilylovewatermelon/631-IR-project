everyone you love is gonna die
but darlin so is everything dont cry
the stars will blink out one by one in time
and everyone you love is gonna die
everything you fear is gonna end
all your hate and hurt lost to the wind
and its hard i know the universe can be a jealous friend
everything you fear is gonna end

chorus
and there might not be a sadder thing
than watchin saturn lose her rings
and black holes slowly dancin in the dark
its a song that they were born to sing
about the end of everything
until it all goes up in one last spark

verse 2
everyone you love is gonna die
but so is everything so wipe your eyes
you know nothin lasts forever but lord we try
everyone you love is gonna die

bridge
all the saints and sinners are the same
were blessed then we obliterate
and thats how it was written from the start
its a song that we were born to sing
about the end of everything
until it all goes up in one last spark
you might also likeoutro
everyone you love is gonna die
so dont you let the moment pass you by
and man there really aint no sadder thing
there really aint no sweeter thing5embed"
