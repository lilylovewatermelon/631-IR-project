a thing i never found that easy to do
the things that you do dont need to be heard
you know your actions baby speak louder than words

chorus
ive got the bottle bring me your cup
pop the cork and try a sup
and when youre empty ill fill you up
well drink it down till the sun comes up

im heading home like a steaming train
foot to the floor in the driving rain
my head is aching and my mouth is dry
ive got a thirst only you can satisfy

chorus
ive got the bottle bring me your cup
pop the cork and try a sup
and when youre empty ill fill you up
well drink it down till the sun comes upsee ub40 liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
