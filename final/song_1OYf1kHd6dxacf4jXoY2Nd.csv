all i did was drink all day in that hell they call la
a southern born man wants a gun in his hand
when he sees how they run that place
never say im better than anyone
cause lord knows that im not
but that california summer wasnt that hot

verse 2
we went out there searchin for something
instead we all got lost
we were headin out west and the plans were goin south
never counted no cost
by the time i hit arizona i was on my way to see
65 days in la is enough for me

verse 3
and i would drink till the sun came up
and i was tryin to find myself
but its hard to find yourself in a state like that
i was born a runnin man and anywhere im free
but 65 days in la is enough for me

verse 4
been a few good folks out there any and everywhere
we were runnin down the same things all about insane
thinkin wed find them out there
steppin over bums on the sidewalk
to get back to my front door
and by the middle of august couldnt take any more
see cody jinks liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeverse 5
so i loaded up what little i had left
and i bought two packs of smokes
i was haulin back to my girl all back to my own
i was born a runnin man and anywhere im free
but 65 days in la is enough for me

65 days anywhere is too much for me
too much for meembed"
