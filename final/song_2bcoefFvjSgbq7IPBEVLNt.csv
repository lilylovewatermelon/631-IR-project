dread lock swing down me back like repunzel
my breddren sling dem pack an dem bundle
well take your tings sell it back to your uncle
and well make it rain till your dances will come true
well make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit
alone when i came but im leavin with them two
gals give me brain give me brain like temples
and him got the game game sharp like a pencil
and if you want formage we can crash like a symbol
and let prepare me window on my new sports coupe
twelve hoarses in the hood sittin on hoarse shoes
come from the land that jesus walked through
sacrifice me life man i bleed for me uncle
them no want to run run with me them no want to
murder them and the family them belong to
next ting them kno i run a street like a car door
you go after me me i dearly depart you
hip hop is mine now mine what you gone do
i can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
playtime for me cuz see to me they are cartoons
how come every joint be on point like a harpoon
how come evry bar stand strong like a barstool
how come every line is so raw you gone snort too

murder them man i murda them fuck a competition man i murda them
man murda them man i murda them fuck a competition man i murda them
and that is why im hot
