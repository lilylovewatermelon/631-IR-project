uh i hope that god decides to talk through em
that the people decide to walk with em
regardless of pitchfork cosigns ive jumped
make sure the sound man doesnt cockblock the drums
let the snare knock the air right outta your lungs
and those words be the oxygen just breathe
amen regardless ima say it
felt like i got signed the day that i got an agent
got an itunes check shit man im payin rent
bout damn time that i got out of my basement
bout damn time i got around the country and i hit these stages
i was made to slay them
ten thousand hours im so damn close i can taste it
on some malcolm gladwell davidbowiemeetskanye shit
this is dedication
a life lived for art is never a life wasted
ten thousand

chorus
ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
ten thousand hands they carry me
ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
ten thousand hands they carry me

verse 2
now now now
this is my world this is my arena
the tv told me something different i didnt believe it
i stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
i could be who i wanted if i could see my potential
and i know that one day ima be him
put the gloves on sparrin with my ego
everyones greatest obstacle i beat em
celebrate that achievement
got some attachments some baggage im actually workin on leavin see
i observed escher i love basquiat
i watched keith haring you see i study art
the greats werent great because at birth they could paint
the greats were great because theyd paint a lot
i will not be a statistic just let me be
no child left behind thats the american scheme
i make my livin off of words and do what i love for work
and got around 980 on my sats
take that system whatd you expect
generation of kids choosin love over a desk
you put those hours in and look at what you get
nothin that you can hold but everything that it is
ten thousand

ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
ten thousand hands they carry me
ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
ten thousand hands they carry me

verse 3
same shit different day same struggle
slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
nothing beautiful about it no light at the tunnel
for the people that put their passion before them being comfortable
raw unmedicated heart no substitute
bangin on tabletops no subs to toot
im feelin better than ever man what is up with you
scrapin my knuckles im battlin with some drug abuse
i lost another friend got another call from a sister
and i speak for the people that share that struggle too
like they got somethin bruised
my only rehabilitation was the sweat tears and blood when up in the booth

bridge
its the part of the show where it all fades away
when the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
and you wanted an encore but theres no encore today
cause the moment is now cant get it back from the grave
part of the show it all fades away
lights go to black band leaves the stage
you wanted an encore but theres no encore today
cause the moment is now cant get it back from the grave
outro
welcome to the heist
welcome to the heist
welcome to the heist
welcome to the heist
welcome to the heist
