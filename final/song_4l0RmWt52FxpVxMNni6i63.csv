you broke me first

verse 1
maybe you dont like talkin too much about yourself
but you shoulda told me that you were thinkin bout someone else
youre drunk at a party or maybe its just that your car broke down
your phones been off for a couple of months so youre callin me now
prechorus
i know you youre like this
when shit dont go your way you needed me to fix it
and like me i did
but i ran out of every reason

chorus
now suddenly youre askin for it back
could you tell me whered you get the nerve
yeah you could say you miss all that we had
but i dont really care how bad it hurts
when you broke me first
you broke me first

verse 2
took a while was in denial when i first heard
that you moved on quicker than i couldve ever you know that hurt
swear for a while i would stare at my phone just to see your name
but now that its there i dont really know what to say
