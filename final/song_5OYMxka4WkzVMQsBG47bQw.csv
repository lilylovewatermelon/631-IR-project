every reason not to go
i dont think youll like it
i hear that citys cold
and the people are much warmer
two good reasons not to go
you fight traffic all day long
then you got to pay to park
you have to go around locking all your doors there after dark

chorus
dont know why you feel you got to go somewhere
have you ever thought about just saying here
if you let me i can give you dont you know
every reason not to go

verse 2
their football team is lousy
no matter what they do
you can bet come sunday theyll find a way to lose
youll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by

chorus
dont know why you feel you got to go somewhere
have you ever thought about just saying here
if you let me i can give you dont you know
every reason not to go

there must be something in this town

cause i know if you werent around id be missing you

chorus
dont know why you feel you got to go somewhere
have you ever thought about just saying here
if you let me i can give you dont you know
every reason not to goembed"
