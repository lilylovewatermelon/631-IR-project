break through the undertow
your hands i cant seem to find
pollution burns my tongue
cough words i cant speak so i
stop my struggling
then i float to the surface
fill my lungs with air then let it out

chorus 1
i give it all
now theres a reason why i sing
so give it all
and its these reasons that belong to me

verse 2
rock bottoms where we live
and still we dig these trenches
to bury ourselves in them
backs breaking under tension
before far too long these voices
muffled by distances
its time to come to our senses
up from the dirt

chorus 2
we give it all
now theres a reason why i sing
so give it all
and its these reasons that belong to me

breathe breathe
the air we give give
the life we live live
our pulses racing distances
breathe so wet my tongue
give break into song
live through seas of competition

verse 3
so please believe your eyes
a sacrifice
is not what we had in our minds
im coming home tonight
home tonight

chorus 2
we give it all
now theres a reason why i sing
so give it all
and its these reasons that belong to me

outro
today i offer all myself to this
im living for my dying wish
i give it all
now theres a reason
theres a reason
to give it all8embed"
