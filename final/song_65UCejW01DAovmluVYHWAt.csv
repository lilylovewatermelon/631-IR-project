we never spoke a word but every thought she had i heard
from across the room
if we were standin face to face i couldnt find the words to say
give me one more move

prechorus 1 zac brown
i dont even know her name
i guess foolish prides to blame

and my heart wont tell my mind
to tell my mouth what it should say
we may have lost this battle live to fight another day
now im fallin in love as shes walkin awayayay
