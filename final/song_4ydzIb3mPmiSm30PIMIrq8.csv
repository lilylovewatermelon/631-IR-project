drivin in silence
a trip around the world
our hands havent touched in more than a month
in my head theres sirens warning me of pain
will this be the night that i make things right
or make things wrong
or make things wrong
or make things wrong

verse 2
your eyes used to wander
but now they sit in place
im sick of all of the nothing on your face
did i put the fire out
did i walk away
did i burn up all the oxygen and throw the rest away

verse 3
and i dont want to be the ball to your chain
seems that every time the weathers on our side
i turn it right
back into rain

chorus
dont hold back
dont wait for the night to end
if its me youre waiting on then i say spend
your time on someone elses sinking ship

try to substitute my dreams with you
and you brought me down on the ship
this ship called life

chorus
dont hold back
dont wait for the night to end
if its me youre waiting on then i say spend
your time on someone elses sinking ship2embed"
