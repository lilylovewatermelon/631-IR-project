didnt they always say we were the lucky ones
i guess that we were once babe we were once
but luck will leave you cursed it is a faithless friend
and in the end when life has got you down
youve got someone here that you can wrap your arms around

chorus
so hold on to me tight
hold on to me tonight
we are stronger here together
than we could ever be alone
so hold on to me
dont you ever let me go

verse 2
theres a thousand ways for things to fall apart
but its no ones fault no its not our fault no
maybe all the plans we made might not work out
but i have no doubt even though its hard to see
ive got faith in us and i believe in you and me

chorus
so hold on to me tight
hold on i promise it will be alright
cause its you and me together
and baby all weve got is time
so hold on to me
hold on to me tonight
you might also likebridge
and theres so many dreams that we have given up
take a look at all weve got
and with this kind of love
and what weve got here is enough

chorus
so hold on to me tight
hold on i promise it will be alright
cause we are stronger here together
than we could ever be alone
just hold on to me
dont you ever let me go
hold on to me its gonna be alright
hold on to me tonight
