i worry i wonder all the time why worry
its killing me forget about it
i whisper remember what she did
dont miss her
set me free she wont allow it

prechorus
angry and gone and the list goes on and on
if its love i will differ im being lost being with her

chorus
i cant move on i cant take it
she she says we wont make it now
i cant move on i cant take it
she she says we wont make it now

verse 2
believing the things i did were wrong
im leaving
it fades away forget about it
shes binding cant do a thing alone
rewinding
times before cant live without it

prechorus
angry and gone and the list goes on and on
if its love i will differ im being lost being with her
