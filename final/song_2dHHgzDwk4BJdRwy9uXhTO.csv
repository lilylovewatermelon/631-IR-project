just cant believe this man
metro boomin want some more nigga
somebody said they saw you
the person you were kissing wasn’t me
and i would never ask you i just kept it to myself
i dont wanna know if youre playing me
keep it on the low
cause my heart can’t take it anymore
and if you creeping please dont let it show
oh baby i dont wanna know
♪
i think about it when i hold you
when looking in your eyes i cant believe
and i dont need to know the truth
but baby keep it to yourself
i dont wanna know if youre playing me
keep it on the low
cause my heart cant take it anymore
and if you creeping please don’t let it show
oh baby i don’t wanna know
did he touch you better than me touch you better than me
did he watch you fall asleep watch you fall asleep
did you show him all those things that you used to do to me
if youre better off that way better off that way
baby all that i can say all that i can say
if you’re gonna do your thing then dont come back to me
ooh
woah woah woah
21
had me crushing i was cuffing like the precinct
how you go from housewife to a sneaky link
got you ridin round in all types of benzs and rovers
girl you used to ride in a rinky dink
im the one put you in eliante on god
fashion nova model i put you on the runway on god
you was rocking coach bags got you chanaynay
side bitch in frisco i call her my bae bae 21
i got a girl but i still feel alone
if you playing me that mean my home ain’t home
having nightmares of going through your phone 21
cant even record you got me out my zone
i dont wanna know if youre playing me
keep it on the low
cause my heart cant take it anymore
and if you creeping please dont let it show
oh baby
i dont wanna know if youre playing me
keep it on the low
cause my heart cant take it anymore
and if you creeping please dont let it show
oh baby i dont wanna know
♪
if you creeping just dont let me find out on god
get a hotel never bring him to the house on god
if youre better off that way better off that way
baby all that i can say all that i can say
if youre gonna do your thing then dont come back to meyou might also likeembed"
