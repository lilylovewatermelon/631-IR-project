orange and white dark red green and yellow
rainbow colors do not hide see the view
step aside go through
against the light too strong blow a fuse now
everything bright new songs burning shoes
the look in your eyes break our bones into half
scream and shout and do laugh
let yourself go oh oh oh
let yourself go oh oh oh
stay close to me
count one two and three
up in through your sleeves
bursting through the seams
open your eyes and see  youll see
inn um ermar upp hryggjarsúluna
yfir skóg flæðir niður brekkuna
allt upp í loft ég mun aldrei gleyma
því ég mun aldrei

hleypur um rífur leysir flækjurnar
upp með rótum með blik í augum
stórmerki undur brjótum bein í sundur

stay close to me
count one two and three
up in through your sleeves
bursting through the seams
open your eyes and see

stay close to me
count one two and three
up in through your sleeves
right beyond the trees
show you how youll be

stay close to me
count one two and three
up in through your sleeves
bursting through the seams
open your eyes and see
youll see

stay close to me
count one two three
up in your sleeves
youre right beyond trees
stay close to me
count one two three
up in your sleeves
burst through the seams
open your eyes and see
youll see youll see5embed"
