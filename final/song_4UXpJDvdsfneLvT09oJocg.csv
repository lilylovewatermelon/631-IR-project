im in the collard green 6 cornbread in the guts
got the halloween kicks trickortreating the clutch
cmon nigga is you tricking or what
flow flow tighter than a dick in the butt
just hopped off the plane came back from vancouv
little white tee some boobs and bamboo
white girls tell me hey nicki your camp rules
is that why you get more head than shampoos
assalaam alaykum no oink for me
and i never let a dboy boink for free
cause its barbie bitch you can join the wave
ive done penny nickel dimed i done coined the phrase ha
you couldnt beat me there if you had a lear
indianstyle courtside with a cavalier
vip ros√© you can have a beer
cause honey when you getting money you dont have a care
