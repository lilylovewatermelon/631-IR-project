my rep is dangerous like some powdered coke fronts
youre a softie on wax like some sourdough lumps
yo you need to take a shower i smell your powerful funk
you cower seeing us your quarterhour seems up
for me it took a snorted bump a courted slut divorce and drugs
to force the fuzz to forage this fudge
look its the black forrest gump
you beating me but tell me who here didnt
im on a twoyear mission to prove that your shits written
and if i fucking lose this crowd will know that youre still just a twobit dipshit
and i think grind time would wanna choose this druggedout misfit
over your runs house mixes sounding like jojos twin bitch
i come to oakland then i maul with my moniker
but you all on my balls acting like a hall monitor
i called up your mom to come over cause i promised her
this is trailer park trash versus some barelyknown cat
you would need a jheri curl track and without that i would doubt that you ever looked black
yo grind time

round 1 dlor
nobody considers me a fresh cali rhymer
until i get on stage and put him in a death valley driver
fuck the battle bars ill end your breath
im out for the dragon star on a ninja quest
ill cook ya mom some crystal meth then tell that bitch to kiss the chef
but fuck this bitch emcee lets get to me
about how i enjoy the simple things like spitting heat and slapping the fuck out of this brittle geek
see back when we was up in pop warner and little league
xt was in the rink practicing his triple deke
and thats just to show you that im better with mine watch the veteran shine
see x is such a sensitive guy and i aint letting it slide
he likes to give head to all the men in his ride
the only time he feels pussy is getting in touch with his feminine side
you cant spit in my eyes youre just a worthless human
living a life with absolutely no purpose to it
you think you styling on me you cant merc me stupid
you might also likeround 2 xt
dlor youre just a faggot thats blabbering
im sure youve paid dues playing magic the gathering
the crowd heres the truth this is a catalyst and battery
you need to go back to mathematics and practicing
cause all that dickriding he does is not taken as flattery
yo i fucking leave you scarred and hurting when i feed you brain blows
its like battling fucking levar burton from reading rainbow
having a stars bankroll fucking this numbnuts should be grateful asking to be badly strangled
youre ashy and youre mangled
ill turn your hat into a halo and make you daddys little angel
see its a mystery to me how a bitch turning tricks on christmas eve high on speed
could have skipped a gene and misconceived so at birth you came out looking like mr t and the missing link
sorry but beating mes a distant dream
you need to stick to things for witless geeks like being clean and counting sheep
yo i smoke an ounce a week while you pout and squeak with sound thats bleak
look around the streets dlor your rhymes put the town to sleep
yo

round 2 dlor
you think you beating me lots of luck
my squad is tough stopping us is harder than stalling up an armored truck
homie you probably rap about how i count sheep and rep vacaville
but youre so pussy youre vagisil
actually youre not really rapping ill
yo im coming back and ill fucking slash his grill like a slasher film
cause thats how i do it cause i got the hatchet still
homie nobody thinks this guy is rhyming
he acts like he lived a life of violence
like he lived in pelican bay or rikers island
when the truth is youre about as nice at rhyming as miley cyrus
plus he listens to the dave matthews band and they might be giants
so how the fuck can this kid get hype hes never witnessed strife
he used to throw fits and cry when his daddy went on a business flight
you from sacramento well let me get this right
when i fist his dyke her clit gets like the christmas lights in citrus heights
round 3 xt
but look dlor is from middleclass vacaville thats a place where littleass faggots chill and zero to no crack is dealt
you watch heroes with your boyfriend while you two applicate the vagisil
you know how i know hes pussy cause he drinks chamomile and reads danielle steel
fucking somebody get this guy out of the closet
im gunning for hot chicks hes giving hummers in bathrooms at hot topics
look his alias in chatrooms is hot for cock chocolate
homie your frisco cap
take that off remove your shirt you would be on castro asking where the fucks the disco at
yo nice dance you hop and fiddle
yo your rhymes sound like a topping riddle yo bob my hibble
yo cause you eat kibble yo  this is a rhyme thats ending
yo you aint fucking hardcore you soft like splenda
yo i use you like a fake sedative yo all of your relatives will know that im ten years logically ahead of them
yo im not saying youre fucking not dope at battling
but you and me have done this nine times and i dont know if youve ever won
yo cause i kill it son

round 3 dlor
yo on the real i think this kids scared
im about to smack him and watch his bitch hair turn whiter than ric flairs
whoo
homie you think you the cock of the walk with provocative talk
this right here is meant to get your posse to stop and think possibly not
yo ill put you in a triangle choke and knock out ya oxygen box
and leave your esophagus blocked till all consciousness stops
you were arrested for petty crime and larcenous plots
so how he gonna escape me when he cant even evade the cops on his block
im at the spot at the top with a massive mental
you see him mobbing in his familys pinto fronting like i crashed the benzo
see thats a rental
for me getting money is actually simple
for you getting cash is the definition of accidental
you aint a rapper you some standardissue sacrificial faggot with bad enough luck to have me rap against youembed"
