you know what i mean
its like walking in the heat all day with no water
its like waiting for a friend
watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
or losing in an argument
though youre right cant get your thoughts in order

prechorus
still i refrain from talking at you talking on
you know me well i dont explain

chorus
but what the hell
why do you think i come round here on my free will
wasting all my precious time
oh the truth spills out
and oh oh i ive told you now

verse 2
you know what i mean
although i try my best i still let down the team
youre everything i want
why should i resist when you are there for me

prechorus
still i refrain from talking at you talking on
you know me well i dont explain

why do you think i come round here on my free will
wasting all my precious time
