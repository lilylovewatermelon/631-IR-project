yeah look
straight out the holy land to holdin grams
tratratrappin out stolen vans with goals and plans
lonely man remember bein my only fan
im down and up the midas touch the golden hand
blood in the soil is over oil
coldhearted my blood boils
the spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
man these arms cant reach you ars wont recoil
goddamn i might marry a heiress and move to paris
fuck the carriage baby lets go disappear and just perish
thirty karats in the gold
i wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
my chariot is mclaren
its all numeric
talkin numbers you incoherent
dont be embarrassed i blame your parents for even caring
or not aborting ah fuck it its not important
my vital organs cant even tell if its night or morning
final warning final warning final warning
every morning youll awake and await mourning
we earn it then we burn it to ash
i call it urn money
my dog caught 40 before he turned 20
money is earned the rest is inherited
hashish come from marrakech all my kush is american
man i feel like a therapist pistol on me like maravich
i careless im so perilous with all of this arrogance goddamn
money hoes thats something that you cant chase
i aint shit but let you eat from the same plate
if you ungrateful then you aint great
me and khaled come from the same place
huh holy land holy land
back when i was holdin grams just to haul a benz
yeah holy land holy land
my father never was a holy manyou might also like4embed"
