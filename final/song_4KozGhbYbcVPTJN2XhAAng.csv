look how far we came
through the fire i stood knowing we would reign
feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
through these maybach curtains i see how life has changed

meek mill
i think imma dedicate this one
to all the people that thought i wouldnt make it here
dreamchasers

couplet 1 meek mill
yeah it was all a dream
on the corner servin all them fiends
me and a bunch of my niggas yeah we was all a team
the system labeled us killas but momma called us kings
walked through the hall of a prison now its the hall of fame
and people got the nerve to ask why i wear all these chains
when i was booked they had me shackled to the wall of shame
so im just representin better yet just reminiscin
put down on that bentley truck i used to want the expedition
now its bigger things grew up and got bigger dreams
cause in my hood niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
and this money shit aint funny all the shit it brings
you bound to lose your family and your friends boy this shit is mean
and birthdays was the worst days
last week i made a hundred on a thursday
and club liv got me sinnin on a church day
stevie j all on the mic he screamin out my birthplace
philly we back
you might also likerefrain

couplet 2 nas
im blunted  you wanna see lifes meaning
on the radio al green while moms cleanin
moms singing along with the songs
and shortly i learned the words to em
nerf balls i threw em
but now im a perfectionist to a fault like jesus
judgin his own miracles but he wont cause he automatic
im like an old blues singer living in the bottle
whose wife left him down in the bottom
writing songs is how we solvin the problem
my liquid moneys a hypnotist to your mrs
lay back like im in the chair of a dentist
nasir relentless a freak like prince is
mystique like sade
soon as i enter people point and see my anointment
i aint tryna do too much
same time i aint no bum nigga not doin enough
but i aint tryna do no dumb shit chasin my tail in a circle
i made it so im chillin now
transparent ceiling now

refrain
couplet 3 rick ross
the chorus cinematic going back to cali
young street nigga late 80s suede ballys
jewels like rick the ruler looking like i ripped the jeweler
i could cut a check make some people hit your shooter
domino effect you in that magic city
where all they do is flex call it milli vanilli
coming from the bottom my lil nigga from philly
young legend outta queens take over city to city
honor thou mother go to war for my brother
giving sufficient funds to significant others
went from poor now women screamin for my signature
more war came from the bottom so i know the war
never worn always on yall niggas luke warm
talking cash over salads heavy croûtons
cuban linxs equivalent to having suits on
stretch maybachs til they bring the coupes on
