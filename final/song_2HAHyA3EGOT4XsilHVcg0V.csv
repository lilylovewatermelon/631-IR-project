the embers of memories of the flame that is past
the way that the drapes cling to the clasps
of the essence of all that rises and falls is the sound

verse 2
melody still lingers long after the song
the way that the ground takes claim above
of the essence of all above and below ground is the sound

chorus
well i used to think that life was just an accident
happened once and then broke never ever to happen again
like a dream or a trance until i heard the sound
until i heard the sound

verse 3
the embers of memories of the flame that is past
the way that the drink clings to the cask
oh the essence of all that collapses or crawls is the sound

chorus
i used to think that life was just an accident
happened once and then broke never ever to happen again
like a dream or a trance until i heard the sound
well i used to think that life was just an accident
happened once and then broke never ever to happen again
like a dream or a trance until i heard the sound
until i heard the soundsee dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeembed"
