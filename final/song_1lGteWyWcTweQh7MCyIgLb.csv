raised in the first pew praises for yeshua
case of a small town repression
your body was baptized so disenfranchised
i was your favorite confession
my past was checkered
your spotless record was probably in jeopardy
your place or my place
his grace and your grace felt like the same thing to me

chorus
i never felt like i was sinning with you
always felt like i could talk to god in the morning
i knew that i would end up with you
always felt like i could talk to god in the morning
if its so wrong why did it feel so right
if it’s so wrong whyd it never feel like sinning with you
sinning with you

postchorus
yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
i felt closer to the stars with you
i felt forgiveness in my heart with you
saw the light in the dark with you
felt like i could fly
take me down where the river is
pull me under in your innocence
i wasnt in it for the hell of it
i guess that’s why

i never felt like i was sinning with you
always felt like i could talk to god in the morning
i knew that i would end up with you
always felt like i could talk to god in the morning
if its so wrong why did it feel so right
if its so wrong whyd it never feel like sinning with you
sinning with you

bridge
i hate it when i cant feel the holy spirit
i know what it feels like crossin the line
but i never felt shame never felt sorry
never felt guilty touching your body
as long as youre for me as long as im for you
who could be against us baby

outro
ooh ooh
if it’s so wrong why did it feel so right
if it’s so wrong whyd it never feel like sinning with you
sinning with you3embed"
