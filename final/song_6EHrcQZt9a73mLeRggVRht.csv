my time came back round and its right now
know that they were thinkin that they want me for to lose
know that they were pressin they was tryna find clues
i popped out now im the news

verse 1
everything green in the inside
pray to get it on when we slide
everything that i say know i can show for it
mama said no sold dope for it
and i even sung up in the choir
i aint even partied stayed in and now im out now
i done seen them tell you that they love you to death and then they walk out
let off shots hit thе ground the only thing that he aint walk off
and its a sad thing to say but they know not to play with my dawg
hundrеd plaques inside my proof vault
for when they try to say that we aint have to make a way
made more funds i had to buy more guns to make it through the day
tell me that my baby mamas dont deserve everything
tell me that my brothers dont need money after goin through all this pain
slime say he aint a rapper and he aint trippin i say nigga get it
i aint against you thug im with you thug if you ever need it im comin with it
had it hard when i was comin up and i know my mama proud i did it
high up in the sky aint comin down tell them all for to mind they business
got put in a cycle then i broke the mold
they dont like me better not try it only thing the game give a black rose
how the fuck you always right and im always wrong
how you feel i gotta keep one tight fight for your life or might not make it home
but i say my time now
you might also likechorus
my time came back round and its right now
know that they were thinkin that they want me for to lose
know that they were pressin they was tryna find clues
i popped out now im the news

verse 2
shoot dice for to pay my fiftydollar phone bill
every day shot basketball with toby with jj id pop pills
my brother 3three he used to go to school i was breakin up in houses stealin
back and forth to jail just like my cousin derek but thats how we lived
where im from its either focus or get killed
in a lifetime it be millions that aint make it out for real
i know niggas sold drugs when i was a child and they still
you aint gotta grow up fast this shit aint leavin itll be here
this shit hurt so deep and bad it make us all shed a tear

bridge
i gotta get me a bag im talkin right now
momma im up on it know they want me for to lose
they dont really love me as bad as they talk huh
hustle or dont get it im the one who had to choose

chorus
my time came back round and its right now
know that they were thinkin that they want me for to lose
know that they were pressin they was tryna find clues
i popped out now im the news
outro
im the news now
yeah i i knew that day in prison they was tryna find clues on a nigga and all that other shit
like they they they playin them blues on me they aint believe
like they aint really think nothin of this you know until we turned it into somethin
shit we we still carryin on
yeah and we still stayin strong
foreverembed"
