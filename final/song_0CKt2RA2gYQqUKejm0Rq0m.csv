when i got trucked on that old field i almost quit that team
i almost gave up guitar cause it hurt to play those strings
when everybody told me no man i ’bout gave up on my dream
i almost let it go
i almost broke my leg riding dirt bike with no fear
i almost lost my best friend over some girl freshman year
i almost lost my license driving home after two beers
almost lord knows
oh but when i look back now

chorus
thank god for the almost thank god for the so close
thank god for the night i came within an inch of that fence post
for the doors that open for the ones that slam closed
thank god for the girls i thought id marry but left me heartbroke
thank god for the highs thank god for the lows
thank god for the almost

verse 2
i almost got that tattoo on my back that said delta chi
almost didnt visit granddad a week before he died
i almost didn’t kiss that girl turned out to be my wife
guess someone else had something else in mind

chorus
thank god for the almost thank god for the so close
thank god for the kick that came within an inch of that goal post
for the doors that open for the ones that slam closed
thank god for the girls i thought id marry but left me heartbroke
thank god for the highs thank god for the lows
thank god for the almost

thank god for the almost thank god for the so close
thank god for the right not left i took when i came to them crossroads
for the doors that open for the ones that slam closed

thank god for the highs thank god for the lows
thank god for the almost
oh thank god for the almostembed"
