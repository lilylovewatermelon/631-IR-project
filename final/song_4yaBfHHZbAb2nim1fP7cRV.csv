i live in harmony with worms underneath
the dirt and the soil
my home away from noise

chorus
i want to wake up there
i wish theyd make a grave

verse 2
the guilt i feel for this
im clean
but my worlds a mess
i wait
i wait for it
your ghost
i wish it haunted me
these last few months i felt a lack of love
i felt the weight drop down on us

chorus
i want to wake up there
i wish theyd make a grave
i wish you knew i cared
it hurts to say your name
you might also likebridge

chorus
i want to wake up there
i wish theyd make a grave
i wish you knew i cared
it hurts to say your nameembed"
