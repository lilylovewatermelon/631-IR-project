keep on writing youre just raping yourself
nothing here can take my mind away from them
dont you ask about me ask about somebody else
once ive fallen theres many stories to tell
i can feel it wont embrace it its overwhelming how far you take it
stuck in a state of questioning
and dont you tell me you know we are destined you wont convince me i wont listen
resentment building you have put our lives on hold

chorus 1
trashed and scattered again im feeling so low
you waste your breath while fucking with me my blood is so cold
my destination always unknown ill find my way there
but you goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time

chorus 2
i wont be the victim but the first to cast a stone
sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
and dont you try to stop me its a place youll never know
dont try to judge or take shots at me ill never let you seize control

postchorus
play your game and walk away your integrity dont mean shit huah
crawl on me you fucking parasite and im going to take you out
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
label me thats fine i will be somebody else
nothing in front of me but holes ahead
lie about my life have a story to tell
lights went down was on the edge and i fell
oh youre so insightful let me remind you to twist and break me should make you worried
long way to go and you are right there
twofaced liar dont try and know me deceit brings fire makes sure you cant breathe
pick at pieces of my body below

verse 3
i never bothered with all the rumors too much garbage
all the same
ill stand right here come on you falsehood deceitful liar
i know my destination  theres no shame
dont ever take my side i know youre never right ill justify the means
nothings what it seems
ill stand around and fight but theres no point tonight been chained to this machine

chorus 3
trashed and scattered again im feeling so low
you waste your breath while fucking with me my blood is so cold
my destinations always unknown ill find my way there
but goddamn imposter are you out of your mind

bridge
i walk down these roads alone and now you are seen here
my feelings that im having towards you are perfectly clear
i control this ride
my devils appetite is tonight and now im alright
but you goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time
prechorus
play your game and walk away your integrity dont mean shit huah
crawl on me you fucking parasite and im going to take you out

chorus 2
i wont be the victim but the first to cast a stone
sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
and dont you try to stop me its a place youll never know
dont try to judge or take shots at me ill never let you seize control

outro
dont try and get the best of me
no one can help but your own self
city makes my body ache
lonely dont try and prey on me
feel your world keep dying dont try and get the best of me
no one can help but your own self
no more use in trying city makes my body ache
lonely dont try and prey on me
and my bodys trashed and low but to you ill never show myself or whats inside
and ive seen it all before and ill settle the score
ill never join your side5embed"
