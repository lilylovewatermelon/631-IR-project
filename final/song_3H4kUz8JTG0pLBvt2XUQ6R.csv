without you here everythings in black and white
without you here im upside down
without you here honey im a melody
living in a world that cant hear sound

verse 1
if these boots could fit a railroad track
id be gone and never look back
if my thumb could flag a wild wind down
id lean back and let it blow me around
and try to land anywhere other than without you here
without you here every breath is wasted
without you here im just a ghost
without you here im stranded at the station
and my mind caught the last train for the coast
if this truck were a time machine
id rev it up and let it carry me
light years away or on down the line
id give the shirt off my back or my last dime
if it can take me anywhere other than without you here
theres roads and sky boats and wine
a million ways to leave you behind
i dont know where
but theres still life out there
not without you not without you here
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus
cause without you here everythings in black and white
without you here im upside down
without you here honey im a melody
living in a world that cant hear sound1embed"
