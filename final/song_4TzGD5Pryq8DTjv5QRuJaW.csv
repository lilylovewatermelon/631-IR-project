whys this always gotta happen to me i should have known
i never fail to never learn from mistakes still throwing stones
bloodsigned we made a pact
yours dried out you took it back

prechorus
and you know you are a paradox and you contradict
the road you walk everything that you ever did
cutting into my code
erasing everything i know

chorus
hear me out
im sorry but im a little less than sold
ive been around
heard all the stories you said you never told
youre used to speaking in tongues
to feel like youre in control
now youve got nowhere to run
now youvе got nowhere to go

verse 2
i feel my focus fadin away i had high hopes
running from thе man that i used to be but im too slow
bloodsigned we made a pact
yours dried out you took it back
