my gears they grind more each day
and i feel like theyre gonna grind away
oh
and the city blocks they drive me wild
theyre never ending mile after mile

chorus
i just dont know what to do
im too afraid to love you

verse 2
its heaven on earth its in her embrace
her gentle touch and her smilin face
i am just one wishing that i was a pair
with someone oh somewhere

chorus
i just dont know what to do
im too afraid to love you

bridge
all those sleepless nights and all those wasted days
i wish loneliness would leave me but i think its here to stay
what more can i do cause im wringin myself dry
and i cant afford to lose one more teardrop from my eye woah

im too afraid im too afraid
i just dont know what to do with myself
thinkin all about you
dont know what to do
dont know what to do
drivin me outta my mind8embed"
