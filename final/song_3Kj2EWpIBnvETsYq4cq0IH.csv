you were a phonograph i was a kid
i sat with an ear close just listening
was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
you were a miracle i was just holding your space
hmm

verse 2
well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
the past she is haunted the future is laced
heartbreak you know drives a big black car
i swear i was in the back seat just minding my own
hmm

chorus
and through the glass the corn crows come like rain
they wont stay they wont stay
for too long now
this could be all that we know
of love and all

verse 3
well you were a dancer and i was a rag
the song in my head well was all that i had
hope was a letter i never could send
well love was a country we couldnt defend
hmm hmm
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
through the carnival we watch them go round and round
all we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns
oh

verse 4
well you were a magazine i was a plain jane
just walking the sidewalks and covered in rain
love to just get out of some of your stories
me all of my plain jane glory
just me and all of my plain jane glory
