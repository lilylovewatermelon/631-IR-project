my world astir and sickly
spits out our voices singing
tra la la la on high now
to kingdom come so slightly
herein a void in your place
i twitch and tweak in allusion
to sit and stare so blankly
until all hope is used up

chorus
why do i always need to need you when youre fleeting
where do you go when im around
what have i done what have i lost thats so defeating
and have the nerve to wear a crown

hook x4
oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey

verse 2
in some dark room
a smoky figure fills me full
makes my head swell in ruin
my family kneels at their pew
they nod we believe in what youre doing
i feel it rise above me
the western landscapes towering
and from my shell of a body
the flowers blossom for picking

why do i always need to need you when youre fleeting
where do you go when im around
what have i done what have i lost thats so defeating
and have the nerve to wear a crown

hook x4
oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey

breakdown
ive waited and waited for someone to take it
dont fight it dont bother an inch for another
dont listen dont hear them theyre in this together
ive learned well now hear me theres much to be fearing
im used to your absence your faceless distractions
ive painted your patterns but found them attractive
now ive been leaning towards a life far more candid
though lead through the dark with your eyes as my candles
where your life and my lifes directions can wrangle
and all of a sudden youve left me to handle
the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall
and somehow or somewhere i found out the secret
to staying alive without actually breathing2embed"
