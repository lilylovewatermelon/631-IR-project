glory to the newborn king
peace on earth and mercy mild
god and sinners reconciled
joyful all ye nations rise
join the triumph of the skies
with the angelic host proclaim
christ is born in bethlehem
hark the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king

christ by highest heavn adored
christ the everlasting lord
late in time behold him come
offspring of a virgins womb
veiled in flesh the godhead see
hail the incarnate deity
pleased as man with man to dwell
jesus our emmanuel
hark the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king

hail the heavnborn prince of peace
hail the son of righteousness
light and life to all he brings
risn with healing in his wings
mild he lays his glory by
born that man no more may die
born to raise the sons of earth
born to give them second birth
hark the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
you might also likeit came upon the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
peace on the earth goodwill to men
from heavens all gracious king
the world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing

still through the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled
and still their heavenly music floats
oer all the weary world
above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hovering wing
and ever oer its babel sounds
the blessed angels sing

o ye beneath lifes crushing load
whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow
look now for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing
oh rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing
for lo the days are hastening on
by prophets seen of old
when with the evercircling years
shall come the time foretold
when the new heaven and earth shall own
the prince of peace their king
and the whole world send back the song
which now the angels singembed"
