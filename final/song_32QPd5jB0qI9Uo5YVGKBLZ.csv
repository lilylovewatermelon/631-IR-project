well the curves down your back
remind me of those railroad tracks
that wed jump and not look back
in our youth
and the brown in your eyes
reminds me of those mornin skies
where the sun would try to hide
behind the roof
the way those rivers flow in july
keeps the lakes from goin dry
it reminds me of what you do to my
angry heart

chorus
cause you look like oklahoma
and ill keep you like i stole ya
ill thank god when i hold ya
cause it feels right
youre the moon in oklahoma
and im the night
youre the moon in oklahoma
and im the night

verse 2
when you say the words you say
it reminds me of the days
wed go dancin downtown
chemicals in our brains
when you move the way you move
it reminds me of the grain
the twists and turns
and plays among the plains

cause you look like oklahoma
and ill keep you like i stole ya
and ill thank god when i hold ya
cause it feels right
youre the moon in oklahoma
and im the night
youre the moon in oklahoma
and im the night
well you look like oklahoma
and ill keep you like i stole ya
and ill thank god when i hold ya
cause it feels right
youre the moon in oklahoma
and im the nightembed"
