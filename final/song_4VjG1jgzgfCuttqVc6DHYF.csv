before i hit the ground
its your hand that reaches out
keeps me from falling down
when i thought this was over somehow

chorus 1
you keep me steady
when this feeling hits me
and im not ready

verse 2
put me back together
and tell me its okay
and i couldnt ask for anyone better
when i thought this was over  somehow

chorus 2
you keep me steady
when this feeling hits me
and im not ready
you keep me steady
when i lose my balance
when i cant see clearly
