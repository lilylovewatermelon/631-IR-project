that kicked up dirt and brought out this side of you baby
its one of those moods yeah its the one of those days
what kind of dark snuck up and took a bite of you baby
the longer it goes well the shorter your fuse
maybe youd know if you walked in my shoes
damned if i dont and im damned if i do
cold as the concrete
tough as a backstreet
like a frat boy at hell week
babe you got a mean streak
fire in the hole and a hole in my heart
youre on a roll and im taking cover now baby
where does it end and where do i start
to soften the sting one way or another now baby
be good to me honey im on your side
im going to bend going to let a lot slide
but hey whats the deal with your jekyll and hyde
rough as a dry creek
sharp as a hawks beak
coming fast as a stampede
babe you got a mean streak
hard as an oak tree
mas as a queen bee
hot as majave
yeah it burns like a dry heat
tight as a kite string
bad as a black sheep
sure as a heart beat
babe you got a mean streak
there in your shadows save room for meyou might also likeembed"
