here i am
torn into a thousand shapes and folds
torn into a thousand ways i know
fornicate inside your broken homes
before i throw a smile your way no more

verse 2
i cant tell
if all my answers correlate at all
im telling you a thousand things i know

chorus
ive been missing a long time
to know i had to move
ive been waiting my whole life
to know i wanted you
are you feeling me slowly
you can take your fucking time
and i promise i wont lie
well make it out alive

verse 3
im on trial
im not so good at hiding wholesome truths
you see it on my face when i turn blue
so punish me im hanging on your noose
so pull me up so i can breathe with you

i know
ive been missing a long time
to know i had to move
ive been waiting my whole life
to know i wanted you
are you feeling me slowly
you can take your fucking time
and i promise i wont lie
well make it out alive
