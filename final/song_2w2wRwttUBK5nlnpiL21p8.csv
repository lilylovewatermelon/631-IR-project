verse 1
and after all these years
still i want you here
im here for you
if you want me too
and though you did me bad
and often make me sad
im here for you

chorus
im still here for you if you want me too
im still here for you
im still here for you if you want me too
im still here for you
im still here for you
im still here for you
im still here for you
im still—

outro
and thats what people dont understand
love just doesnt go away it stays there
it haunts you
it keeps you from trustin
and thats why its so hard to let go
i choose to put an end to this chapter in my lifе
and though i waited for you like god waits for his own children i must lеt go of you cause im not god
i love you jamiesee montell fish liveget tickets as low as 67you might also likeembed"
