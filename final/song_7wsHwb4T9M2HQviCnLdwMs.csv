i could talk all day long about the news
giving you the current affairs and my views
i could talk all night long about a song
giving you the pointers on where youre going wrong
i could talk all year long about the net
sending you the links i think you havent seen yet

id like to tell you things that i think you never heard
but there are no words

verse 2 danny odonoghue
i could talk all day long about dreams
sewing up your heart so you never see a seam
i could all day about politics
all of the corruption clean hands dirty tricks

but what can i say
about something that blows me away
without it sounding like another clich√©
from what ive seen what ive heard
when it comes to you
baby no there are no there are no words

ooh
there are no words
ooh
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likeyeah i swear this much is true
there aint no word in this world that describes you

verse 3 danny odonoghue
i could talk all day long about life
after so many wars how were all still alive
i could speak all night long about the world
and how it took me thirty years just to find one girl
i could shoot st for days all about guitars
a gibson or a fender it depends on who you are

but when i try to say something that you never heard
there are no words

verse 4 danny odonoghue
i could burn your ear off all about space
and why we have a moon why the moon has a face
if the earth is spinning why we all stay in place
why we cant walk its gotta be a space race

but what can i say
thats gonna blow your mind away
turn around a classic not a throw away
all ive seen all ive heard
when it comes to you
there are no there are no there are no words
ooh
there are no words
ooh

yeah i swear this much is true
there aint no word in this world to describe you
repeat 2x

no words

bridge mark sheehan
there are no words to describe or define whats inside you
youre feeling your vibe
believe me ive tried to
break you down to a science
see you in my mind
and i open my mouth and its silence
i can articulate a shakespeare poem
even though i didnt know him
i can see where he was going
and where hes coming from
i can even catch his flow and
when i think of you i dont know where this metaphor is going
cuz there are no words you can understand
only lovers can
you can ask a professor and a mad man
if they couldnt find the words no one can
all i see all i heard
when it comes to you
theres just no just no words
there aint no there aint no

no words
just no words
no words

yeah i swear this much is true
there aint no word in this world that describes you
repeat 2x

just no words4embed"
