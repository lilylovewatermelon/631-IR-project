in a field of fire
youre left to burn
to brittle bones
ashes you will turn
i will not regret
what i have done
to save you from
what you will become

chorus
i am clean
i am pure
i am calm
its not your fault
i am clean
i am pure
i am calm
its not your fault

verse 2
on a whim of trust
ill fall apart
to fragile dust
to cleanse my heart
covered with leaves
that i call home
we are serene
leave us alone
