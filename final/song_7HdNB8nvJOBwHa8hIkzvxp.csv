verse
i cant let these niggas knock me off my pivot
god sat me down and talked to me i listened
i was in that cell he told me that i’m gifted
i dont make it in the booth then ima make it in the kitchen
i’m special with the mic special with the whippin
i ran out of money had to pay attention
all the people that was round me they aint have my best interest
you aint have my best interest
you lazy with yo loyalty and yo position
and now i gotta execute cause you don’t listen
that throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
i know shawty only on my trail cause she see a ticket
i’m readin between the lines and peepin they intentions
cant have you niggas around me shit gon’ go to missing
i had to press that bump i had to feel it
you know if it ever come down to it a nigga with it
all these drugs got the whole world jiggy
hoes comin out they clothes and niggas trippin
why hit the top to go back to the bottom
all these bitches fallin for me like its autumn
im tryna tell you homie you dont want none
they freed me so im right back to that monyun
somebody tell these niggas they dont want none
kodak black but im spreadin blue hundons
they sent my nigga cool on the fuckin run
when they let him out of prison ill be 31
i knew i was a star when i was sellin hard
everybody told me i would make it when i was on the block
see before this rap shit i was jackin cars
i couldnt get all my time cause i was doin fraud
me and my nigga lil marcus tearin up the wyatt
it hurt me to my heart heard they gave him 25
im from the noya all i know is slang that iron

just like i told you if im lyin then im flyin
just like i told you if im lyin then im flyin
just like i told you if im lyin then im flyin8embed"
