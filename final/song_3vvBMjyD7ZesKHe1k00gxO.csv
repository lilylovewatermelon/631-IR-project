waking up your neighbors downstairs
ive been inside your bedroom a thousand years
and as you tie me to the bed for good i say
that i want you in the most unromantic ways
louisiana youre torturing me with a beautiful face
ana come on i thought we had a damn good thing damn good thing
a penny in the couch and a diamond ring

chorus
so baby stay away from my friends
cause i need them to carry me
when its over ill count back from ten
and you can listen to glass hearts shattering

verse 2
i dont know how you get into me
down my throat and made a home in my veins
they used to be the rivers that would take us away
now you only call me every christmas and my birthday
i still cant believe how you look next to me
just like a strip club bedroom scene

chorus
baby stay away from my friends my friends
cause i need them to carry me
when its over ill count back from ten
and you can listen to something that youve never heard before
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
oh woah oh woah never heard before
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah never heard before
oh woah oh woah
oh woah oh woah

outro
but you dont know what its like
to wake up in the middle of the night
scaring the thought of kissing razors
this blood evacuation is telling me to cave in
stay away away oh no no
oh no
just stay away away from my friends from my friends
away away away
away away away13embed"
