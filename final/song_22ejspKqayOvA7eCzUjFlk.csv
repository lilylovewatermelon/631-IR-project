tank top love handles
tube socks jesus sandals
cheap blender ice bucket
raw oysters yeah give me one and shuck it

prechorus
holds up a frozen orange daiquiri and laughs
heres to the boys at the factory

chorus
no more building transmissions
hes going deep sea fishing
catch a marlin catch a tan catch a local cover band
hey you gotta watch that man
hell go coastal on you

verse 2
silver hair silver buick
winters coming better move it
southbound fore they get snowed under
call the kids tell them see you next summer

chorus
no more freezing their tails off
its cataract sunglasses and a round of golf
red skin green plaid margarita dog track
before you know it mom and dad
theyll go coastal on you
