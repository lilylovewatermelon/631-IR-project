all your life you just stood there questioning
feeling your ambition crumble away
as the power within you began to decay
never finding what you were searching for
and feeling a longing you couldnt ignore
you felt it ache inside like never before

prechorus
take the path that the weak ones demonize
look around and begin to realize

chorus
that youre no longer alone tonight
youre coming into your own tonight
one of the brave and the bold tonight

verse 2
the burden you bear can cripple you
a ravenous cancer eating your soul
lost within a world beyond your control
so tonight let there be a reckoning
let this moment empower you to no end
let the doubts within you start to descend

that youre no longer alone tonight
youre coming into your own tonight
one of the brave and the bold tonight
that youre no longer alone tonight
become the heir to the throne tonight
one of the brave and the bold tonight
