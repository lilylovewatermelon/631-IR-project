friend of mine sex is child inside
adored by that sex soaked in wine
the dark world we hide paint the child to entice

chorus
rain suicide is rain in pain suicide is rain in pain
falling into gutters they splash their remains

verse 2
what is night without the stars
what is dark about the heart
whats in the park  were not there anyway

chorus
rain suicide is rain in pain suicide is rain in pain
suicide is rain in pain suicide is rain

bridge
i cant be bothered
i cant be bothered
i cant be bothered
