im taking a moment just imaginin that im dancin with you
im your pole and all youre wearing is your shoes
you got soul you know what to do to turn me on until i write a song about you
and you have your own engaging style
and youve got the knack to vivify
and you make my slacks a little tight
you may unfasten them if you like
thats if you crash and spend the night

chorus
but you dont fold you dont fade
youve got everything you need especially me
sister youve got it all
you make the call to make my day
in your message say my name
your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all

verse 2
curl your upper lip up and let me look around
ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
and bend your back and ask those hips if i can touch
cause theyre the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your butterfly
well you float on by
oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
or eskimo your nose real close to mine
and lets mood the lights and finally make it right

let me feel you up side down slide in slide out slide over here
climb into my mouth now child

verse 3
butterfly well you landed on my mind
damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
now i see you perfectly behind closed eyes
i wanna fly with you and i dont wanna lie to you
cause i cause i cant recall a better day
sun coming to shine on the occasion
youre an openminded lady
youve got it all
and i never forget a face
if im making my own
i have my days
lets face the fact here its you whos got it all
you know that fortune favors the brave
well let me get paid while i make you breakfast
the rest is up to you you make the call
chorus

in your message say my name
your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all
