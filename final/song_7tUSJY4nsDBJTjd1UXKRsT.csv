wouldnt you think my collections complete
wouldnt you think im the girl the girl who has everything
look at this trove treasures untold
how many wonders can one cavern hold
looking around here you think
shes got everything
ive got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
ive got whozits and whatzits galore
you want thingamabobs ive got twenty
but who cares no big deal i want more

i wanna be where the people are
i wanna see wanna see them dancin
walking around on those  what do you call em feet

flippin your fins you dont get too far
legs are required for jumping dancing
strolling along down a  whats that word again street

up where they walk up where they run
up where they stay all day in the sun
wanderin free  wish i could be
part of that worldyou might also likeembed"
