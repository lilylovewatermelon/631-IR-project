hey lucy i remember your name
i left a dozen roses on your grave today
im in the grass on my knees wipe the leaves away
i just came to talk for a while
got some things i need to say

chorus
now that its over
i just want to hold her
id give up all the world to see
that little piece of heaven lookin back at me
now that its over
i just want to hold her
ive got to live with the choices i made
and i cant live with myself today

verse 2
hey lucy i remembered your birthday
they said itd bring some closure to say your name
i know id do it all different if i had the chance
but all i got are these roses to give
and they cant help me make amends

chorus
now that its over
i just want to hold her
id give up all the world to see
that little piece of heaven lookin back at me
now that its over
i just want to hold her
ive got to live with the choices i made
and i cant live with myself today
