i cant see through the tears in my eyes
i cant see through the tears in my eyes i cant breathe
i feel i failed i was meant to make you smile
i was meant to make you shine to make you shine

verse 2

forever you said youd run away
you said youd run away you said youd run away with me
with me youd run away

that wed escape from the world that tied us down
that wed escape from the ordinary
that wed escape from the world that kept us apart
