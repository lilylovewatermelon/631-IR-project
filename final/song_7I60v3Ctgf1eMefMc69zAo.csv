keep up the fight
im giving my all while im still alive
you only get one better know your rights
you only get one better live your life
like uh theres no time to rest
you hear that sound you never know whats next
i stay around never nothing less
cause i might be down
but im not dead yet

hook
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet

verse 1
theres gon be some day
when im laying in the ground underneath my grave
when im six feet down in between domains
when i wrote my will and gave my estate
when i look back at the life i lived
and i think about all the things i done did
all them promises and the words i meant
with no regrets i blessed to say until then
im a keep living keep doing my best
so when im free from all the things
thatll keep me depressed
when im finally able to get this weight off my chest
you gon see me with a smile
you can have all the rest
cause im still here for a minute while the suns up
everyday i breathe with two thumbs up
brighter days to the sky on the come up
everybody on my side wont you run up
death has no power over me
im alive and i breathe no grave can hold me
down and i see the demons still flee
and jesus still reigns the king of all kings
no evil on me cause my freedom still rings
the name of my god will conquer all things
the devil wants me to fall on my knees
today i stand above my enemies
from covid19 another crime scene
another murder so we keep on fighting
you cant argue all the things that ive seen
i cant lie through all these words im writings
we all fall short but we keep on rising
no ones a saint so we call the vikings
i dont care if nobody likes me
this world is frightening but hes still providing

keep up the fight
im giving my all while im still alive
you only get one better know your rights
you only get one better live your life
like uh theres no time to rest
you hear that sound you never know whats next
i stay around never nothing less
cause i might be down
but im not dead yet

hook
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet

verse 2
i step into the scene i need to take a breath for me
go until i bleed til i succeed
go until i see the things i dream
and i take another step and change the speed
talk to god begin to intercede
and im shooting for the stars its out of reach
falling to the earth into the sea
and im running for a while im in the lead
everything made new
heart breaks to the place that i came to
then we step into the zone thats a breakthrough
and we walk through hell like its the main route
look i gotta new plan
and it all involves being a new man
and it all involves another unresolved compassion flaw
you better start shooting man
ive got a couple of words for the most high most high
got a couple of words for the lord amen
if you burn my soul til the reprise reprise
you should take my soul to the morgue wait a minute now
ive been off on some new heights
yo i’ve been looking for some more
and it dont matter if we do die
cause we just riding all aboard
but ill be living and sinning
and making all of these dividends
til i’m maybe preventing
the only thing that i see
i’ve got a minute to benefit
but i’ve seen the beginning
im going over the limit
im dealing with the police
we going over the gimmick
i know nobody will listen
and i got too many tickets
so my insurance is weak
but im pretending im timid
im tryna stick to the mission
im burning too many bridges
so now im finally free
chorus
keep up the fight
im giving my all while im still alive
you only get one better know your rights
you only get one better live your life
like uh theres no time to rest
you hear that sound you never know whats next
i stay around never nothing less
cause i might be down
but im not dead yet

hook
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yet
im not dead yet
i might be down but im not dead yetembed"
