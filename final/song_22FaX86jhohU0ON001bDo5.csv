oh for the first time in your life
youre asking me for my advice
but dont you dare think youre off the hook
without me taking an honest look
you got nothing up your sleeve
you got plenty on your mind
and your mouth is getting dry
because youre yawning all the time
and the days are getting longer
but your patience ticks away
and the wind could knock you over
if the walls werent in the way

chorus
what can you do
what can you do about it
what can you do
what can you do

verse 2
oh youve got to close your eyes
strike that youve got to open them
oh your thoughts are flexible
but somehow you have broken them
youre knocking at the door
like youd rather not find out
what is on the other side
because it proves beyond a doubt
that you never had a clue
what you wanted all along
you attempt to hold your ground
like being weak is being strong
you might also likechorus
what can you do
what can you do about it
what can you do
what can you do
oh i dont know run outside and twirl
scream hello at this hyper world

verse 3
oh run the rooftop marathon
until your sense of up and down is gone
discover ten brand new ways
to make tomorrows weather like todays
youre stuck inside a pattern
youre stuck inside a loop
and youre stuck inside a pattern
youre stuck inside a loop
and youre stuck inside a pattern
youre stuck inside a loop
and youre stuck inside a pattern
youre stuck so take a hammer to it

chorus
what can you do
what can you do about it
what can you do
what can you do
oh i dont know run outside and twirl
scream hello at this hyper world
bridge
i only understand myself
just me and nobody else
i only understand myself
just me and nobody else

outro
what can you do what can you do about it
what can you do what can you do about it
what can you do what can you do about it
what can you do what can you do
what can you do what can you do about it
what can you do what can you do
oh i dont know run outside and twirl
scream hello at this hyper world
i dont know run outside and twirl
scream hello at this hyper world3embed"
