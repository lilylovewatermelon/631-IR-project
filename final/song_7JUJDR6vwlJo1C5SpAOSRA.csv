verse 1
when you and i first met
we were so inseparable so inseparable
and on that last day i left
thinkin wed need a miracle need a miracle
cause every little word that you said to me
became the biggest pain in my heart
and all my pride making me pretend
to be so happy that were apart
you just dont understand

chorus
you just dont understand
youve got to be there for me
you hold my heart in your hand
youve got to be there for me
you just dont understand

so far down this road
im not sure we can repair sure we can repair
and each and every time we be on the phone
we both actin like we dont care actin like we dont care
it would be so sad to me
to be the one that got away one that got away
and it hurts just as much to see
to see the feelings we have decay
decay in front of our eyes

chorus
you just dont understand
youve got to be there for me you
you hold my heart in your hand
youve got to be there for me you just dont understand
you just dont understand oh no no

you hold my heart in your hand
youve got to be there for me
