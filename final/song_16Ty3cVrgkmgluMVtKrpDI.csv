i caught a chill
and its still frozen on my skin
i think about why im alone
by myself no one else to explain
how far do i go no one knows
if the end is so much better why dont we just live forever

prechorus brent smith
dont tell me im the last one in line
dont tell me im too late this time

chorus brent smith
i dont want to live to waste another day
underneath the shadow of mistakes ive made
cause i feel like im breaking inside
i dont want to fall and say i lost it all
cause baby theres a part of me that hit the wall
leaving pieces of me behind
and i feel like im breaking inside

verse 2 lzzy hale
out here nothings clear
except the moment i decided to move on and i ignited
disappear into the fear
you know there aint no comin back when youre still carrying the past
you cant erase cant erase separate separate

chorus brent smith
i dont want to live to waste another day
underneath the shadow of mistakes ive made
cause i feel like im breaking inside
i dont want to fall and say i lost it all

leaving pieces of me behind
and i feel like im breaking inside
