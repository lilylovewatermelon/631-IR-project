while im grading papers and tying shoes
you never had much to lose
so im blaming you for these hopeless blues

whats to say when the kids are gone
ive made up the beds and been left alone
you look at me as cold as a stone
theres no way to write whats been done wrong

you left me a fool
so what to do

hold me down if im running off
they say it gets better baby soon enough
so ill shut my mouth and ill steal my heart
i still feel like a girl thinking when we started but

i want to feel the fire again with you or anybody else
i want to feel the fear again with you or anybody else
so what to do what to dosee the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likeembed"
