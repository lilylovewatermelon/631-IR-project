well way down yonder on the chattahoochee
it gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
we laid rubber on the georgia asphalt
we got a little crazy but we never got caught

prechorus
down by the river on a friday night
a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin about cars and dreamin about women
never had a plan just a livin for the minute

chorus
yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about livin and a little about love
aw haw

verse 2
well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
i was willin but she wasnt ready
so i settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
i dropped her off early but i didnt go home

prechorus
down by the river on a friday night
a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin about cars and dreamin about women
never had a plan just a livin for the minute
