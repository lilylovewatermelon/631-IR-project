ive been watching you walk
ive been learning the way that you talk
the back of your head is at the front of my mind
soon ill crack it open just to see whats inside your mind

chorus
inside your mind

verse 2
maybe i will wait until youre fast asleep
dreaming things i have the right to see
maybe you are dreaming youre in love with me
the only option left is look and see

chorus
inside your mind
inside your mind

verse 3
i can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
ive had dreams where theres blood on you
all those dreams where youre my wife
