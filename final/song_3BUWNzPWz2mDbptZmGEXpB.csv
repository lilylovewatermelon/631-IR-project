verse 1 lil wayne
tunechi you a genius
looked in the mirror said
dont let the money come between us
i’m loaded loaded at my earliest convenience
but fuck em i feel like i got ten middle fingers
im sippin sippin in this bitch and poppin uppers
girl take this this that shit that give a flower color
and some bitch named wonder woman told me not to wonder
the crumbs you only see em when the cookie crumble
real shit nigga my candle still lit
had to swallow my pride though swear it tastes like spearmint
big up to my nigga with a strap on em
i never turn my back on ’em
’cause nigga act like they cool with ya
but a lot of these niggas be transformers
a lot of these players be benchwarmers
the game aint easy but it’s fair nigga
imma sit in this throne so long
til its a fucking rocking chair nigga
bad bitch play with my hair nigga
said relax tune baby don’t stress out
but i got a lot of shit on my mind though
she said let that shit work itself out
let that shit work itself out

verse 2 lil wayne
cita you a psychic
cause you said there be days like this
they want a piece of me i aint the one thats serving slices
please swallow i had my share of dirty diapers
real shit pussy niggas on that guilt trip
itll be on in a heartbeat
you can hear them pussy niggas shit skip
i fear god never fear men
give back never give in
beat odds never beat women
keep an open mind let em peek in it
reach highs never reach limits
need minds i dont need plenty
this c5 this for bi and left eye and tboz
when i seen chilli at the floyd fight
i almost asked her to creep with me
but i was young and i held my tongue
but with that tongue i just keep spitting
so it all worked out
interlude 2 lil wayne  sampha

and life said tune you knew me for way too long
i never change you know i been this bitch
and then she said let it all work out
let it all work out let it all work out yeah
let it all work out let it all work out

verse 3 lil wayne
tunechi you a monster
looked in the mirror but you wasnt there i couldnt find ya
im lookin for that big old smile full of diamonds
instead i found this letter you aint finished writin
it read im sorry for even apologizing
i tried compromising and went kamikaze
i found my mommas pistol where she always hide it
i cry put it to my head and thought about it
nobody was home to stop me so i called my auntie
hung up then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
too torn apart about it i aim where my heart was pounding
i shot it and i woke up with blood all around me
its mine i didnt die but as i was dying
god came to my side and we talked about it
he sold me another life and he made a prophet
outro lil wayne  sampha  jacida carter
yeah and he said
let it all work out yeah
let it all work out
im still in this bitch
let it all work out
yeah thank god cause im still in this bitch
let it all work out
let it all work out phew
let it all work out
but he said remember this
let it all work out
let it all work out
aint nobody else like you in this bitch
let it all work out yeah
let it all work out
and dont forget what i did this bitch
let it all work out
cant even remember when i didnt bitch
let it all—
let it all work out yeah
let it all work out
now im out this bitch
let it all work out
im out this bitch
let it all—
and it all worked out
love you dwayne29embed"
