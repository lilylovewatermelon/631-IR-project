dont know whats going on
dont know what went wrong
feels like a hundred years
i still cant believe youre gone so ill stay up all night
with these bloodshot eyes
while these walls surround me with the story of our life

chorus
i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever
i tell myself that i dont miss you at all
im not lying denying that i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever

verse 2
now things are coming clear and i dont need you here
and in this world around me im glad you disappeared
so ill stay out all night get drunk and fuck and fight
until the morning comes
ill forget about our life

chorus
i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever
i tell myself that i dont miss you at all
im not lying denying
that i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever

first time you screamed at me
i should have made you leave
i should have known it could be so much better
i hope youre missing me
i hope ive made you see that im gone forever
and now it’s coming clear that i dont need you here
and in this world around me im glad you disappeared

chorus
i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever
i tell myself that i dont miss you at all
im not lying denying
that i feel so much better
now that youre gone forever

outro
and now you’re gone forever
and now you’re gone forever14embed"
