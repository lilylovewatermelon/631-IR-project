i got my sights set on you and im ready to aim
i have a heart that will never be tamed
i knew you were something special
when you spoke my name
now i cant wait to see you again

verse 2
ive got a way of knowin when something is right
i feel like i mustve known you in another life
cause i felt this deep connection
when you looked in my eyes
i cant wait now i cant wait to see you again

chorus
the last time i freaked out
i just kept looking down
i stststuttered when you asked me what im thinking bout
felt like i couldnt breathe
you asked whats wrong with me

the next time we hang out i will redeem myself
my heart it cant rest til then
ohwhoawhoa
