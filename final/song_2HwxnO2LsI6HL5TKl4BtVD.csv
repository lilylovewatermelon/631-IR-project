four am two hours to go
im wearing out a lonely glow
i miss you more than i can know
here i am here i am wont you get me

chorus
ive got my hands at redemptions side
whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
ill fit all of these monstrosities inside
and ill come alive come alive

verse 2
with my fist down at your feet
i was runnin out of mysteries
insecure and incomplete
here i am here i am
wont you get me

chorus
ive got my hands at redemptions side
whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
ill fit all of these monstrosities inside
and ill come alive
come alive alive come alive

and my fears have worn me out
my fears have worn me worn me out

chorus
ive got my hands at redemptions side
whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
ill fit all of these monstrosities inside
and ill come alive
ive got my hands
at redemptions side
whose scars are bigger than

ill fit all of these monstrosities inside
and ill come alive come aliveembed"
