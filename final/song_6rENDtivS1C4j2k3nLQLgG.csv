staring back in time
the two of us intertwined
and your black boots
walking fast next to mine
we were chasing the thunder inside the storm
running so wild outside the norm
and what remains
the two of us against the grain

prechorus
come out come out wherever you are
i know youre there i know you are

chorus
they called us crazy cause we never fit in
we never bothered keeping up with their trends
it didnt matter that we werent on the list
cause we were misfits we were misfits

verse 2
staying up all night
drinking more than we should getting way too high
when the sun came through
i watched you laugh i saw you cry
cause the world has a way of tearing you down
keeps you tied to the circus paints you up like a clown
but im right here
day after day year after year

so come out come out wherever you are
i know youre there i know you are

chorus
they called us crazy cause we never fit in
we never bothered keeping up with their trends
it didnt matter that we werent on the list
cause we were misfits we were misfits

chorus 2
and after all we never played by the rules
we broke them all and found our own kind of cool
it didnt matter that we werent on the list
cause we were misfits we were misfits

bridge
dont wait up dont wait up
dont wait up dont wait up
dont wait up dont wait up
were long gone

chorus
they called us crazy cause we never fit in
we never bothered keeping up with their trends
it didnt matter that we werent on the list
cause we were misfits we were misfits
chorus 2
and after all we never played by the rules
we broke them all and found our own kind of cool
it didnt matter that we werent on the list
cause we were misfits we were misfits

outro
dont wait up dont wait up
dont wait up dont wait up
were long gone1embed"
