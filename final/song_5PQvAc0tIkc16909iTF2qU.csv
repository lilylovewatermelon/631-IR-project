theres nothing to me now
an empty shell unfolded
how when we learn to pray
inside our demons are laughing
how long will this go on
are we a bit much stronger
do you think you can save me
from living this way

chorus
i dont know how to love
i just know how to live
all i feel is hate
will you forgive me

postchorus
do i
do i
do i

verse 2
for all those things ive done
they keep on creeping by me
and though weve changed our ways
still all our demons are laughing
how long will this go on
arent we a bit much stronger
id like to think youve came
into my life to stay

i dont know how to breathe
with you too far away

will you forgive me

chorus
i cant live
i cant live this way

with you too far away

past lives ive lived
uncontrolled but sacred

so hard to breathe
will you forgive me
will you forgive
