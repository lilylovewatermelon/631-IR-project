ill fix the strings and play my part
i know the pain thats in your heart
ive tread the distance near or far
just wanna be right where you are

i know love has been a stranger to you
maybe im the one to change it for you
wont be easy cause the lessons feel new
but the writings on the wall

so dont you make it hard
cant you see me see me see me
be easy with my heart

postchorus
all we got is here and now
why wont you let your guard down

love is easy
so dont you make it hard
