she had a cross around her neck
and a flower in her hand
that i picked from the side of thomas drive
on our way to the sand
we found an old wooden chair
still warm from the sun
pushed it back gave me a kiss with bacardi on her lips
and i was done

chorus 1
and we spent that week wide open
upside down beside the ocean
i didnt know where it was goin
just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
i shouldve known that kind of feelin
would last longer than that week did
blown away and barely breathin
sunday came and it was over
now shes got me twisted
like an old beach roller coaster

verse 2
the rest of those days
turned into long crazy nights
when the music got loud
wed sneak away from the crowd
under the boardwalk lights
and with all the things we said
what i just cant get past
is the way we let it end
now im wonderin where she is
knowin i cant get that goodbye back

and we spent that week wide open
upside down beside the ocean
i didnt know where it was goin
just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
i shouldve known that kind of feelin
would last longer than that week did
blown away and barely breathin
sunday came and it was over
now shes got me twisted
like an old beach roller coaster

bridge
shes like a song playin over and over
in my mind where i still hold her
i had the chance and i shouldve told her

chorus 2
when we spent that week wide open
upside down beside the ocean
i shouldve known where it was goin
still tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
and i shouldve known that kind of feelin
would last longer than that week did
blown away and barely breathin
when sunday came and it was over
now shes got me twisted
yeah im still twisted
like that old beach roller coaster
like that old beach roller coaster10embed"
