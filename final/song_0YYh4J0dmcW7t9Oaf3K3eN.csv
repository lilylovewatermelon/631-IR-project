cause your bed is alone
i have tried so hard in vain
nevermore to call your name
when you left you broke my heart
oh darling why do have to part
every hour in the day you can hear me say
baby wont you please come home

i mean baby wont you please come home
cause your dad is so alone
i tried so hard in vain
nevernomore to call you name
now when you left me you just broke my heart
why did we have to part
every hour in the day
people way across the street
if you loved me you better come homeyou might also likeembed"
