she wakes up
rage and grace
pulling me closer pushing away
and me the sharpest thorn on your vine
twisting and turning were all intertwined
broken wing
empty glass
words that scream and bounce right back
she says you know
wed all like to rearrange

chorus
i wish i could fix you
and make you how i want you
i wish i could fix you
and i wish you could fix me
i wish i could heal you
and mend where you are broken
i wish i could heal you
and i wish you could heal me

ha la la la

verse 2
a beaming sunrise buries the night
the setting sun destroys the light
then she says baby ive got to get going
cutting each other without even knowing
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeprechorus
she sees a million stars like holes in the sky
all gods tears for her they cry
and i am in her rain

chorus
i wish i could fix you
and make you how i want you
i wish i could fix you
and i wish you could fix me
i wish i could heal you
and mend where you are broken
i wish i could heal you
and i wish you could heal me

outro
broken wing
empty glass
words that scream and bounce right back
she says you know
