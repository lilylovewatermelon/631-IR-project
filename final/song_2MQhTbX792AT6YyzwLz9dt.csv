the red sandstone it fell
right smack on top of sedona arabelle
when john ford said wont you hop on in
and the stagecoach baby gonna take you for a spin oh whoa
whoa whoa

chorus
well hey little hollywood
youre gone but youre not forgot
you got the cash but your credits no good
you flipped the script and you shot the plot
and i remember i remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
saturday night kind of pink

verse 2
well the blacklist and its hosts
he came down so swift
and you drove him to the coast
were going california but were all out of work
i guess thats better than a grave and a hearse oh whoa
whoa whoa

chorus
hey little hollywood
youre gone but youre not forgot
you got the cash but your credits no good
you flipped the script and you shot the plot
and i remember i remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
saturday night kind of pink

now the devils in a rush
and this duct tape makes you hush
well hey there sedona let me cut you a deal
im a little hungover and i may have to steal your soul
oh ho

chorus
well hey little hollywood
youre gone but youre not forgot
you got the cash but your credits no good
you flipped the script and you shot the plot
and i remember i remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
so bright and pink
saturday night kind of pink17embed"
