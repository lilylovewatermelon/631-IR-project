tear me down
tell me i dont need to fear
tell me now
tell me somebodys near
cause sirens
sirens are all i hear

verse 2
they keep calling out
keep calling out someones name
keep calling out
and all i can do is pray
these sirens
sirens dont come our way

chorus
or well be
all run run running away
or well be
all run run running away
all run run running away
when sirens they come our way

verse 3
its raining down
its raining on someones fears
raining down no
ive heard the rain is the citys tears
but these sirens
these sirens are all i hear

all run run running away
when sirens they come our

all run run running away
when sirens they come our way7embed"
