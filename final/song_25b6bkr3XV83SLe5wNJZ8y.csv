its why the weathers got the mountain shakin weak
i hear the rumblin honey up on the peak
its why the weathers got the mountain shakin weak
oh i know you want to plant your feet
but we best get a move on or the devil we will meet
i feel the quakin honey i feel it deep
rocks are atumblin while the people are asleep
i feel the quakin honey i feel it deep
rocks are atumblin while the people are asleep
oh i pray today my soul to keep
but we best get a move on or the devil we will meet

drop dead sprint my darling now
drop dead sprint my darling now

dont look back now honey just try to breath
that monsters comin and it dont care for you or me
dont look back now honey just try to breath
that monsters comin and it dont care for you or me
oh the angels we may someday see
but we best get a move on or the devil we will meet
oh the angels we may someday see
but we best get a move on or the devil we will meet
see the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeahhembed"
