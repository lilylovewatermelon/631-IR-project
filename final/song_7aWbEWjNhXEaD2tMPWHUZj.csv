maybe im insane
walking on a wire
maybe im the same
nothing can take me higher

tell me where to start
think im at the end
right now feeling pain
make it go away

maybe im to blame
maybe im a liar
maybe were the same
nothing can stop the fire

i cant feel my heart
but i feel the shame
nothing left to say
soon ill fade away

prechorus
these places
all i ever think about is lost in time
these faces taunting me
im looking back and they are mine
chorus
im hiding from the things they say
doing time been lead astray
thinking back to times of yesterday
i could fly

im trying to find a better way
but im trapped cant get away
all i think is about yesterday
i could die

verse 2
maybe im insane

nothing left to say
soon ill fade away
