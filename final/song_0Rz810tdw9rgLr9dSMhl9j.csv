red velvet wallpaper stained by the cigarette smoke
of people more in love than we could ever know
and its midnight and i wanna go but you dont
you get in the passenger seat just to give me a reason
and you cut the brakes just to keep me from leavin
your hands on the wheel drove us into a wall

prechorus
the only world i could exist in
was one you lived in
ooh you almost had me fooled

chorus
but i can be me without you
i dont feel lost without you
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down
i can be me without you bada baba
you dont believe that its true
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down

verse 2
i can be funny and i can be interesting
people can like me it shouldnt be threatening
these are all things that ive learned now that ive been alone
we were so young when it started i thought you might grow up
but that didnt happen youre actually smaller now
i cant believe i stayed long as i did
you might also likeprechorus
the only world i could exist in
was one you lived in
ooh you almost had me fooled

chorus
but i can be me without you bada baba
i dont feel lost without you
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down
i can be me without you bada baba
you dont believe that its true
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down

bridge
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down down

chorus
i can be me without you
the sun doesnt shine cause of you
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down oh
i can be me without you bada baba
you dont believe that its true
go find yourself
you let me down
down down down down down10embed"
