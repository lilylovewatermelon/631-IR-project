i taste you much better
off teeth taste
of white skin on red leather
check the claws we got

nighttime cavity to come in
downtown pony work your pitch

i came to in feathers
like leaves tastes
you rubbed me together
with claws like we got

downtown pony work your pitch
daytime dancer ill come inside
got my teacher now carve your niche

check the claws
