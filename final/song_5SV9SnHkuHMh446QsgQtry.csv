verse 1
im never going nowhere so dont try me
my music sticks in fans veins like an iv
flows poison like ivy—oh they grimy
already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
respected highly hi mr oreilly
hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
drove through the window the industry super sized me
now the girls see me and a rivers what they cry me
im on the rise so many people despise me
got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me surprise
its a celebration and everyone should invite me
roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our nikes bow
explorer like dora—these swipers cant swipe me
my whole auras so mean in my white tee
nobody lightskinneded repping harder since icet

yes indeed ludacris im hotter than nevada
ready to break the steering column on your impala
if i get caught bailout popo—i tell em holla
in court i never show up like austin powers fazha
father father and hey i love gold
but can buy anything i want from the records ive sold
jacuzzis hot cristal is so cold
neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that ive rolled
a pig in a blanket a shmoke and a pancake
drop albums nonstop once a year for my fans sake
i crush mics until my hand breaks
then shag now and shag later til these women cant stand straight
the ludameister got em feeling so randy

brush my shoulder and i pop my collar
cause im worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars

verse 3
causing lyrical disasters its the master
make music for minimes models and fat bastards
these women trying to get me out my pelle pelles
they strip off my clothes and tell me get in my belly
