faint white figures paint my sleep
please dont tell my secrets keep them hidden
you got it you got it you got it
if the words that matter reach your face from floor
will you be wondering if or
do i need what is given or honest
does it cost me scarring if the words stay true
even number your nephew
i dont want it dont want it dont want it anymore

prechorus
and when the answer that you want is in the question that you state
come what may come what may
and when the answer that you want
is in the question that you state
come what may come what may

verse 2
in a pain that buckles out your knees
could you stop this if i plead
you got it you got it you got it
so destined i am to walk among the dark
a child in keeping secrets from
will they know what ive done in the after
in the soughtfor matter when the words blame you
in a blood red summer ill give you
i dont want it dont want it dont want it

and when the answer that you want is in the question that you state
come what may come what may
and when the answer that you want is in the question that you state
