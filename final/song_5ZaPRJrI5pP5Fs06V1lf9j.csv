some say a storm is coming
some say the end is near
some think its all so hazy
i think its all so clear
if it all ends tomorrow
if it all disappears
where do you think youre going
anywhere else but here

prechorus
i dont claim to have the reasons
all i know is

chorus
if the world stops spinning tomorrow
id never shed a tear
id rather be anywhere anywhere
anywhere but here

verse 2
some say they have the answers
some say they know the truth
some people live in question
some people have no clue
