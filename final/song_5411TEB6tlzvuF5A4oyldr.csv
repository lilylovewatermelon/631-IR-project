i dont know what to do without you
i dont know where to put my hands
ive been trying to lay my head down
but im writing this at 3 am

chorus
i dont need the world to see
that ive been the best i can be but
i dont think i could stand to be
where you dont see me

verse 2
on sunny days i go out walking
i end up on a treelined street
i look up at the gaps of sunlight
i miss you more than anything

chorus
i dont need the world to see
that ive been the best i can be but
i dont think i could stand to be
where you dont see me

outro
and autumn comes when youre not yet done
with the summer passing by but
i dont think i could stand to be
where you dont see mesee mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like26embed"
