riding through the city on my bike all day
cause the filth took away my licence
it doesnt get me down and i feel okay
cause the sights that im seeing are priceless
everything seems to look as it should
but i wonder what goes on behind doors
a fella looking dapper and hes sitting with a slapper
then i see its a pimp and his crack whore

prechorus
you might laugh you might frown
walkin round london town

chorus
sun is in the sky oh why oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else
sun is in the sky oh why oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else
when you look with your eyes
everything seems nice
but if you look twice
you can see its all lies

verse 2
there was a little old lady who was walking down the road
she was struggling with bags from tesco
there were people from the city having lunch in the park
i believe that is called al fresco
when a kid came along to offer a hand
but before she had time to accept it
hits her over the head doesnt care if shes dead
cause hes got all her jewelry and wallet

everything seems nice
