mmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmm uh
i cant breathe chopsquad i cant breathe 999
waiting for the exhale
i toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

chorus
i cant breathe im waiting for the exhale
toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
still no luck but oh well
i still try even though i know im gon fail
stress on my shoulders like a anvil
perky got me itching like a anthill
drugs killing me softly lauryn hill
sometimes i dont know how to feel

verse 1
ringring phone call from depression
you used my past and my memories as a weapon
on the other line i talk to addiction huh
speaking of the devil all the drugs i miss them
this cant be real is it fiction
somethin feels broke need to fix it
i cry out for help do they listen
ima be alone until its finished

sometimes i dont know how to feel
lets be for real
