show day is stressful everybody wanna call gotta tell em no
sometimes sit up in a record store 700 fans man everyone signed
and it get so hard tellin em all please try to form one line
with the player haters combined i dont think you know
how much of a strain its been i cant explain its insane
but i wouldnt give up a thang i live with the pain and resort to brain trippin
i need a little release somethin to stop my rage
i really need me a moment of peace so baby girl when i step on stage

chorus krizz kaliko  tech n9ne
