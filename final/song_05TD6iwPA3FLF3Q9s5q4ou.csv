not a whole lot going on
small town friday night
reving up at a red light
on your mark get set go
pass a mom and pop restaurant
same four trucks parked out front
i guess ya gotta make your own fun
when youre stuck in a place this slow
theres only two means of salvation around here that seem to work

chorus
whiskey or the bible a shot glass or revival
when you dont seem to run on either side of the fence
people act like you dont make sense
these big town dreams that ive been chasing
will never come true if i wind up staying
and i dont want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
why do i hang around
yeah yeah
in this church pew or bar stool kinda town

verse 2
im like that am station
that never comes in right
til you pass that city limit sign
thats the only time it all gets clear
its crystal clear that i
just need to find
a place where theres no lines
nothing like it is around here
someplace where it dont feel like this world revolves around
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
whiskey or the bible a shot glass or revival
when you dont seem to run on either side of the fence
people act like you dont make sense
these big town dreams that ive been chasing
will never come true if i wind up staying
and i dont want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
why do i hang around
in this church pew or bar stool kinda town

chorus 2
here it sometimes feels just like this world revolves around
whiskey or the bible shot glass or revival
when you dont seem to run on either side of the fence
people act like you dont make sense
these big town dreams that ive been chasing
will never come true if i wind up staying
and i dont want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
why do i hang around
in this church pew or bar stool kinda town
yeah i need to get out
of this church pew or bar stool kinda townembed"
