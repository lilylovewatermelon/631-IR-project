berry stains on a dirt road
sunlight on her clean clothes
and if i stare forever the road pinches together
the mountains fall into the sea
what if i built the frame and gave you my name
would you wander forever with me

chorus
and drive way up over mt joy
where everyones free now to move how they feel now

verse 2
she blames brooklyn for hand me downs
she wakes up in her parents house
and i got the curse of quivering youth
tell the truth
all you really need is the love in this room
and i open my lips to tell her shes the anchor im a sailor
were lost in the height of the waves
every wave remind me why i feel this way

chorus
and drive way up over mt joy
where everyones free now to move how they feel now
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeinterlude
feel your feet on the festival grounds
they cant stop us feel like ziggy stardust
cause they cant stop us feel like ziggy stardust

and i dreamed you felt it too
and i dreamed it all came true
and i dreamed you felt it too
and i dreamed it all came true
and i dreamed you felt it too
and i dreamed it all came true
and i dreamed you felt it too
and i dreamed it all came true

they cant stop us feel like ziggy stardustembed"
