ten times out of nine i know youre lying
but nine times out of ten i know youre trying
so im trying to be fair
and youre trying to be there and to care
and youre caught up in your permanent emotions
and all the loving ive been giving goes unnoticed
its just floating in the air lookie there
are you aware

prechorus
youre my lifeline are you tryna kill me
if i wasnt me would you still feel me
like on my worst day or am i not thirsty enough
i dont care about the lights or the beams
spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
only way to go is up skin thick too tough mmm

chorus
cause you you you you and me could move a mountain
you you you you and me could calm a war down
you you you you and me could make it rain now
you you you you and me could stop this love drought
