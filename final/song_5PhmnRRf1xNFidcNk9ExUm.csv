everybodys on this rap shit
umm i think i know that
its been almost 8 years 
and nothings been able to hold back 
my confidence to pop off 
even when they said youre so whack
ill never have a change of heart 
cause this is where my soul at
it probably sounds crazy 
but its cold where im from
i thought yous from miami 
where its warm with that sun
everybody swear they cool 
but in the heat of the moment 
its a bunch of cold feet 
and no heat with a gun
now i aint looking for problems 
but i got homies with ars
i wont pull the trigger 
but ill sure that they spray yall
watch your mouth cause nina 
might hit ya for what you say dawg
i dont take threats kindly 
so ill make sure that you stay gone
ridin round in a civic 
taking over the city
these ns be burning bridges 
then wonder why no one with it
i gave them the shows 
showed em the road 
to all the riches 
but they was just hoes 
and didnt know how to handle business
im seriously tired of waiting 
cause everyday im debating 
whether people still want hiphop 
or accustomed to all that fake shit
i got a purpose 
and i know that its to save it
im not playing
im half greatness 
half asian when im blazing
im paper chasing
ill do whatever to make it
my grind is now at its finest 
thats why everybody hates me
i dont sugarcoat shit
i make clear statements
life just aint sweet
not from what ive tasted
you might also likea tale of 2 citiez
there was a time where 
i aint had a pot to piss in 
and i still aint see no opposition 
now im out here politicking 
with some villains in the villas
i swear this the greatest feeling 
next to getting pussy
shouts to pac shouts to big 
shouts to nas too
im the chef now i dont need to call wu
not every great rapper need to rock jewels 
like it dont take bars to know ja rule
i can kill em with the hook kareem abdul
in this case i dont need law school
pregame in the car thats a car pool
dont front baby abkari taught you
only god knows what ive gone through 
and only god knows what im gon do
john 211
im on the stairway to heaven
i had a talk with my reverend
he said that my word a blessing
they talking shit imma check em
my city is what im repping
the only time that they got me 
is any time that i let em
im chillin here smoking reefer
lets kick it like fifa
i dont fuck with no broke hoes
my chick a diva
i be making money by trading my sneakers
pretty n 
gotta cuff for a pair of adidas
most of my shoes got the swoosh 
and i aint talking yeezus
fuck with the boy
you gon rest in pieces
you ns aint no rappers you a ratchet hoe
n got high and thought he had a flow
i be saying shit these ns wanna quote
ns tryna follow anything im on
so back up 
before my dawgs start to act up
ill make one call 
worth more than all your trash talk
ash my blunt on yo ass
thats yo ass fault
turn your ass into asphalt pussyembed"
