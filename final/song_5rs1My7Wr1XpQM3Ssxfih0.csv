yeah colton he turned eight years old three very short long weeks ago
and just how long hell be around the doctors they dont even know
a nerf ball football in the yard daddy throws it easy cause walkins hard
sometimes for living there aint no cure and tomorrow damn sure aint for sure

hook
so what do you say
lets have a good day yeah

verse 2
so way down south from mexico ran a barefoot boy skin and bones
a mission group from the states came through to hand out clothes and build a school
someone gave that kid some bread he didnt keep it for himself instead
he broke that piece too small for one and gave both to his brothers some

so what do you say yeah
lets have a good day
im gonna hold my kids a little stronger
im gonna kiss my wife a little longer

verse 3
well kenny hes a fearless man he lost his eyesight in a hand
standing up for his uncle sam fighting in that desert sand
his wife and kids still struggle when he has those nightmares now and then
he swears even if they never end he would do it all again
