did you think
my life would end that day
that you walked out
when you broke my heart
did you think
i couldnt make it through
ooh without you
did you think
youd stop my world with goodbye
oh no
did you think id crumble inside

chorus
not me im still breathing
and this heart of mine is still beating
and i im not feeling any pain
no baby not me im still breathing
this old heart of mine is still beating
the tears ive cried have dried
you have gone and ive survived
im still breathing yeah

verse 2
there were times
when it took all my strength
to just get through yeah
through another day
there were so many nights
i thought that i was gonna die
without you
but the tears ive cried somehow
made me strong  so strong
