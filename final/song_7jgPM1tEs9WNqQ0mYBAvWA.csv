its the first time i ever felt this lonely
wish someone would cure this pain
its funny when you think its gonna work out
til you chose weed over me youre so lame
i thought you were cool until the point
up until the point you didnt call me when you said you would
finally figured out youre all the same
always comin up with some kinda story

chorus
every time i try to make you smile
youre always feeling sorry for yourself
every time i try to make you laugh
you cant youre too tough
you think youre loveless
is that too much that im askin for

verse 2
thought youd come around when i ignored you
sort of thought youd have the decency to change
but babe i guess you didnt take that warning
cause im not about to look at your face again

prechorus
cant you see that you lie to yourself
you cant see the world through a mirror
it wont be too late when the smoke clears
cause i im still here

but every time i try to make you smile
youd always go off feeling sorry for yourself
every time i try to make you laugh
youd stand like a stone
alone in your zone
is that too much that im askin for

yeah yeah yeah yeah
cant find where i am
lyin here alone in fear
afraid of the dark
no one to claim alone again
yeah yeah yeah yeah

prechorus
cant you see that you lie to yourself
you cant see the world through a mirror
it wont be too late when the smoke clears
cause i i am still here

chorus
every time i try to make you smile
youre always feeling sorry for yourself
every time i try to make you laugh
you cant youre too tough
you think youre loveless
it was too much that i asked him for4embed"
