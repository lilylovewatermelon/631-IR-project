theres a drumming noise inside my head
that starts when youre around
i swear that you could hear it
it makes such an almighty sound
theres a drumming noise inside my head
that throws me to the ground
i swear that you should hear it
it makes such an almighty sound

chorus
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell

verse 1
i ran to the tower where the church bells chime
i hoped that they would clear my mind
they left a ringing in my ear
but that drums still beating loud and clear

chorus
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell

as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder

verse 2
i run to the river and dive straight in
i pray that the water will drown out the din
but as the water fills my mouth
it couldnt wash the echoes out
but as the water fills my mouth
it couldnt wash the echoes out
i swallow the sound and it swallows me whole
until theres nothing left inside my soul
as empty as that beating drum
but the song has just begun

chorus
as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder

theres a drumming noise inside my head
that starts when youre around
i swear that you could hear it

chorus
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell

chorus
as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder13embed"
