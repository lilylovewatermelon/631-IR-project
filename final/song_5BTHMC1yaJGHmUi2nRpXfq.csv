wake up my darling
wake up and see for yourself

you were woven in patchwork
clouded and hazed
in your past like a lover can be

honey its alright
honey its alright
its alright to be
alone
its alright
honey its alright
its alright to be
alone

despite all our shuffling
our train wreck atalking
despite all our outfield saves
treading water
the sea was your daughter
but now shes gone
gone

its alright
honey its alright
its alright to be alone
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likehoney its alright
honey its alright
to be amongst the rubble and stone1embed"
