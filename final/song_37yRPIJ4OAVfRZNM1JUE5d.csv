finally got that promotion i worked hard to get
one that came with a company car
and when they gave me the keys they said son you can bet
keep it up and youll really go far

chorus
but what good is all that knowing
the best thing that i had going is gone

verse 2
my good friends come around to hang out now and then
and they joke man youve sure got it hard
with this house on the hill and a white picket fence
and the grass sure is green in the yard

chorus
but what good is all that knowing
the best thing that i had going is gone

verse 3
well i squandered my time trying to buy everything
gave her all that i thought she deserved
now i know all the things that she wanted were free
and i should have been home holding her
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
but what good is all that knowing
the best thing that i had going is gone
