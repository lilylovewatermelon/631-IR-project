shes the womb that you left and shes the pride that you kept
shes the innocence that you left back in your youth
shes the poems that you read shes the mouth that you feed
and shes the holy and shes truth

chorus
sweet dream woman of the night
come and love me in the night
sweet dream woman come and be
a woman to me

verse 2
shes the mother of youth she is sweet baby blue
and shes a love that you once knew but you couldnt hold
she is bad luck and good and shes all that she should be
and i see her reasons all unfold
