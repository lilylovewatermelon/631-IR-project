i know you hear me when i cry
i try to hold it in at night
while youre sleeping next to me
but its your arms that i need this time this time
look at the cards that weve been dealt
if you were anybody else
probably wouldnt last a day
every tears a rain parade from hell from hell

prechorus
baby you do it so well
youve been so understanding youve been so good
and im puttin you through more than one ever should
and im hating myself cause you dont want to
admit that it hurts you

chorus
i know that it breaks your heart when i cry again
over him mmh
i know that it breaks your heart when i cry again
stead of ghostin him

postchorus
well get through this well get past this im a girl with
a whole lot of baggage
but i love you well get past this im a girl with
a whole lot of baggage oh yeah

though i wish he were here instead
dont want that living in your head
he just comes to visit me
when im dreaming every now and then and then
and after all that we been through and after all that we been through
theres so much to look forward to
what was done and what was said
leave it all here in this bed with you with you

prechorus
baby you do it so well
youve been so understanding youve been so good
and im puttin you through more than one ever should
and im hating myself cause you dont want to
admit that it hurts you baby

chorus
i know that it breaks your heart when i cry again
over him mmh
i know that it breaks your heart when i cry again
stead of ghostin him
