a brand new baby was born yesterday just in time
papa cried baby cried said your tears are like mine
i heard some words from a friend on the phone didnt sound so good
the doctors gave him two weeks to live id give him more if i could

hook
you know that i would now
if only i could
you know that i would now
if only i could

verse 2
down the middle drops one more grain of sand
they say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
words are kind they help ease the mind
ill miss my old friend
and though youve got to go well keep a piece of your soul
one goes out one comes in

hook
you know that i would now
if only i could
you know that i would now
if only i couldsee jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also like2embed"
