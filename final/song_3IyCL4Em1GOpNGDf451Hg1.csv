dont wanna live as an untold story
rather go out in a blaze of glory
i cant hear you i dont fear you
ill live now cause the bad die last
dodging bullets with your broken past
i cant hear you i dont fear you now

refrain
wrapped in your regret
what a waste of blood and sweat
oh oh oh

chorus
i wanna taste love and pain
wanna feel pride and shame
i dont wanna take my time
dont wanna waste one line
i wanna live better days
never look back and say
could have been me
it could have been me
yeah

verse 2
dont wanna live as an unsung melody
id rather listen to the silence telling me
i cant hear you i wont fear you
dont wanna wake up on a monday morning
the thought of work is getting my skin crawling
i cant fear you i dont hear you now
