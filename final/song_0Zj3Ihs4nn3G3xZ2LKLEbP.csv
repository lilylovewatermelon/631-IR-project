i sense theres something in the wind
that feels like tragedys at hand
and though id like to stand by him
cant shake this feeling that i have
the worst is just around the bend
and does he notice my feelings for him
and will he see how much he means to me
i think its not to be

what will become of my dear friend
where will his actions lead us then
although id like to join the crowd
in their enthusiastic cloud
try as i may it doesnt last
and will we ever end up together
no i think not its never to become
for i am not the oneyou might also like1embed"
