i heard you died out in cheyenne
with my mothers ring on your hand
a note in your pocket said ill love you till i die
i can hear the bulls are comin to claim that theyve been huntin
the son of the cowboy came to claim his daddys right
and my baby shes been cryin at the thought of me dyin
she knows theres no stopping a man and his foolish pride

chorus
so open the gates im here to prove
im better than my father was and where he came from too
open the gates im here to ride
to hell i go with daddy by my side

verse 2
and i aint never feared nothin
that was fourlegged and buckin
throw me on a hurricane
and ill ride it to the coast
youll never know that your son
came to do what you shouldve done
on a summer day a long time ago
top a bull named to hell i go

chorus
so open the gates im here to prove
im better than my father was and where he came from too
open the gates im here to ride
to hell i go with daddy by my side

well i died out in cheyenne
with my baby there cryin
and a belly thats been growin by the day
and i know that my son
will do what his father shouldve done
a long long time ago
on a bull named to hell i go

chorus
so open the gates he’s here to prove
he’s better than his father was and where he came from too
open the gates he’s here to ride
to hell i go’s calf with daddy by his sideembed"
