its time that all these things that i do no matter what
become things of the past
its time that all these things that i wish i could forget
join in the ranks
of things i regret
but there arent enough archangels in the sky to come down and
to make me feel right
im miserable whenever i think of it
and i think of it all the time

you could part their feathered wings and have your way with them
just like you do to all of us all the time
what point is there in pushing on
when all you push against is a brick wall
verse 2
everyone spends some time on the cross
i just want to make sure its not a total loss
so maybe ill get tanned
and lose some weight while i wait

everyone spends some time on the cross
i just want to make sure its not a total loss
so deny me three times
or hurry up and fucking decideyou might also like7embed"
