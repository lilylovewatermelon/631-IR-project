lay me down at your altar baby
im a slave to this love
your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
i have prayed for a power like you
to see deep down in my soul
oh you make me bloom like a flower a desert rose

prechorus
magical one a mystery
all of your charms have worked on me
i will surrender myself
holy hell and heaven high
you have opened up my eyes
and i am finally healed

chorus
this is spiritual under your spell
phenomenal the way you make me feel
like an angel all aglow
like a feather you make me float

verse 2
flying high as a kite on your love
lost in sweet ecstasy
found a nirvana finally
