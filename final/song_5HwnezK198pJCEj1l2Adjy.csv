cold cause she has been here before
she doesn’t cry anymore no looking back
no she doesnt go to the bar
too many lovers shes scarred and they want her back

chorus
she loves control she wants it her way
and theres no way shell ever stay unless you give it up
give it up
she loves control she wants it her way
and all it takes is just one taste you wanna give it up
give it up

verse 2
bold you know she lives for the thrill
you know she lusts for the kill so they wont come back
no no no no no no no no
dont dont you try taming the storm
dont say you havent been warned oh
cause she wont like that like that

chorus
