and irony is okay i suppose culture is to blame
you try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
you lack substance when you say something like oh what a shame
its just a selfreferential way that stops you having to be human
im assuming youll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon
and start consuming like a human thats what i am assuming

prechorus
im sure that youre not just another girl
im sure that youre gonna say that i was sexist
i feel like youre running out of all the things i liked you for

chorus
why cant we be friends when we are lovers
cause it always ends with us hating each other
instead of calling me out you should be pulling me in
ive just got one more thing to say

verse 2
and why would you believe you could control how youre perceived
when at your best youre intermediately versed in your own feelings
keep on putting off conceiving its only you that youre deceiving
oh dont have a child dont cramp your style ill leave it

chorus
why cant we be friends when we are lovers
cause it always ends with us hating each other
instead of calling me out you should be pulling me in
ive just got one more thing to say
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeoutro
im just pissed off because you pied me off
after your show when you let go of my hand
in front of some sket who wanted bit on your—
nah im just messing89embed"
