when she goes stormin out
i run for cover
rollin like thunder clouds
hangin above her
ring in the witching hour
spells that im singin
rain come and drown me out
im sinkin deep below

chorus
can you go another round
i will follow you down and out
lets go another round
i will follow you down and

verse 2
we could just lay around
stare at the ceilin
want to forget about
one for the feelin
room full of photographs
box full of letters
come on make it last
nothin else matters right now
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus
can you go another round
i will follow you down and out
lets go another round
i will follow you down and out

chorus
can you go another round
i will follow you down and out
lets go another round
i will follow you down and out
lets go another round
i will bother you down and out
lets go another round
i will follow you down and out
