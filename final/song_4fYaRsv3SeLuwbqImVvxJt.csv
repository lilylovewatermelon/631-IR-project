i have spent a lifetime waitin for the chance
to save you my confession save me your last dance
the same old superstitions haunt us now and then
im beggin for ignition to start it all again

chorus
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride
well burn away from all the other
flames that burn tonight
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride

postchorus
breathe for me from now on
breathe for me when im gone
burn out beyond out beyond the sun

verse 2
will you still remember there behind the skies
walkin on the embers standin in their light
the hardest part is knowin everything must die
the hardest part is waitin here ready to collide
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride
well burn away from all the other
flames that burn tonight
well burn away burn away
burn away my pride

breathe for me from now on
breathe for me when im gone
burn out beyond out beyond the sun
