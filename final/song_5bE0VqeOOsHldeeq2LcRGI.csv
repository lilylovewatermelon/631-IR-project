and see horizons stretch on forever
i want to know that there are lands
not yet touched by human hands
i want to be the one to find them
sometimes i feel like im lost in a desert
and every dune is the same as the other
i see my footprints in the sand
so i know where ive been
and these steps i take wont go to waste
if im moving towards something
i want to believe theres something left for me
a new discovery waiting for me
i want to kindle a love that doesnt age
even when all the years carve lines into your face
tell me i will be surprised
when i think ive memorized
every touch and every thought 
i want you to prove me wrong

i want to believe theres something left for me
a new discovery waiting for mesee the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeembed"
