hello its nice to see you again
did you miss me
were meant to be friends
but it feels like a century
in my head

verse 2
if i say something that comes out all wrong
please forgive me
for feeling this strong
like it feels just like angels
hmmm in my head

chorus
but darling the truth is
in darkness im ruthless
i wanna scream your name
again and again

verse 3
maybe i
am tempted by all that i see
youre nothing like me
im circling the room
in gold and french perfume
you might also likechorus
but darling the truth is
in darkness im ruthless
i wanna scream your name
again and again

refrain
oh baby im misunderstood
and you’re the only one who knows i could
see it all in black and white
looking better by my side

oh baby i dont want to be
the only one thats talking in my sleep
i could be your lullaby
be my lover every night

bridge
can we fly away
can we fly away

chorus
cause darling the truth is
in darkness im ruthless
i wanna scream your name
again and again
outro
oh baby i dont want to be
the only one thats talking in my sleep
i could be your lullaby
be my lover every night5embed"
