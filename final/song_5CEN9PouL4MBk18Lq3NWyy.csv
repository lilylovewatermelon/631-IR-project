verse 1
inseparable thats how we were
through anything you were my world
i gave to you you shared with me
for the love of you id give anything
i would chill with you
you and your crew
never complained bout the things you do
but it see it now how it all went down
cant take no more
dont want you around

prechorus
never told me the whole truth never
now im wishing that i knew
the real you how could you do this to me

verse 2
and now i cant believe all the things you did
all your secret trips just to see your kids

the unlove affair will soon be forgot
and you will miss me but i wont miss you
