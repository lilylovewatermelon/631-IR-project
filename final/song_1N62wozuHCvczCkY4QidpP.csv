i never knew
i never knew that everything was falling through
that everyone i knew was waiting on a cue
to turn and run when all i needed was the truth
but thats how its gotta be
its coming down to nothing more than apathy
id rather run the other way than stay and see
the smoke and whos still standing when it clears

chorus
and everyone knows im in
over my head
over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
shes on your mind shes on your mind

verse 2
lets rearrange
i wish you were a stranger i could disengage
just say that we agree and then never change
soften a bit until we all just get along
but thats disregard
you find another friend and you discard
as you lose the argument in a cable car
hanging above as the canyon comes between

and everyone knows im in
over my head
over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
shes on your mind
shes on your mind
everyone knows im in
over my head
over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
shes on your mind
shes on on

bridge
and suddenly ive become a part of your past
im becoming the part that dont last
im losing you and its effortless
without a sound we lose sight of the ground
in the throw around
never thought that you wanted to bring it down
i wont let it go down til we torch it ourselves

chorus
and everyone knows im in
over my head
over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
shes on your mind
shes on your mind
everyone knows
shes on your mind
everyone knows im in
over my head
im in over my head im over my
everyone knows im in
over my head
over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
shes on your mind
shes on your mind32embed"
