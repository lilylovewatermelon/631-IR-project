my left hand aint interested in nothin but a drink in it
yeah ill have this dance i like this song its got some swing in it
you aint johnny and i aint june
but you can be my man in black tonight baby if you want to

chorus
someday i want the weddin
somethin borrowed somethin blue
flowers and a veil
and a sunset honeymoon
but tonight we aint nothin
but a downtown bride and groom
gettin hitched on whiskey vows
and exchangin drunk i dos
with neon diamonds and smoke rings
neon diamonds and smoke rings

verse 2
i aint one for champagne and them fancy crystal stem glasses
fore i settle down ill probably have to kick some bad habits
til last call do us part
we aint gotta get married to pretend we are

chorus
someday i want the weddin
somethin borrowed somethin blue
flowers and a veil
and a sunset honeymoon
but tonight we aint nothin
but a downtown bride and groom
gettin hitched on whiskey vows
and exchangin drunk i dos
with neon diamonds and smoke rings
neon diamonds and smoke rings

neon diamonds and smoke rings
neon diamonds and smoke rings
