you think im pretty without any makeup on
you think im funny when i tell the punch line wrong
i know you get me so i let my walls come down down
before you met me i was alright
but things were kinda heavy you brought me to life
now every february youll be my valentine valentine

prechorus
lets go all the way tonight
no regrets just love
we can dance until we die
you and i well be young forever

chorus
you make me feel like im livin a teenage dream
the way you turn me on i cant sleep
lets run away and dont ever look back
dont ever look back
my heart stops when you look at me
just one touch now baby i believe
this is real so take a chance and dont ever look back
dont ever look back

verse 2
we drove to cali and got drunk on the beach
got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
i finally found you my missing puzzle piece
im complete
