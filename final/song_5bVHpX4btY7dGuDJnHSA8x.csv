bobbys in the basement making his movie
he paints a little picture but not to be cheesy
he wants this little girl to believe in him easy
bristles to the canvas imagining he feels high mmm
inspiration of my heart search for light out of the dark
all the pictures in my heart lie awake there in my fog
this oasis in my arms i approach it with disarm
though it might do me some harm stop to catch me if i fall

verse 2
bobbys in the basement making his music
he never wont stop though not to abuse it
if theres some other way that they only would use it
he lives another day but they always refuse it

verse 3
lacerations of my heart
dropped down in pieces in the dark
mixed the words up on this page
makes the purple turn to beige

verse 4
inspiration of my heart search for light out of the dark
all the pictures in my heart lie awake there in my fog
this oasis in my arms i approach it with disarm
though it might do me some harm
so stop to catch me if i fall

its just like bob dylan says
stop depression of my own walk the only road i know
if i am only dreamin then i am not that far from it
sow the strength that grows from seeds worship creativity
if i am only dreamin then me an bob are not that far today
so long as im young
bobbys in the basement making his music

bridge
i search the beaches walk the sand
i cut my feet on broken glass
strap the sandals on my feet
im run down but i still hit the street

prechorus
inspiration of my heart search for light out of the dark
all the pictures in my heart lie awake there in my fog

chorus
its just like bob dylan says
stop depression of my own walk the only road i know
if i am only dreamin then i am not that far from it
sow the strength that grows from seeds worship creativity
if i am only dreamin then me an bob are not that far today
so long as im young
so long as im young mmm

bobbys in the basement making his movie
he paints a little picture but not to be cheesy

desperation of my heart mmm mmmembed"
