verse 1
i feel
what ive been feeling for you
means i am falling for you
somethings opened up inside of me
and i dream
in shades that only can be
the colors of you and me
i think we both know what that means
i stand
inside this promise ive made to myself
but i was meant for you

chorus
if i fall
if i break
if i lose myself in someone
if i give all i am
it will be with you
when im ready to take
all that you want me to give
it will be worth the wait
worth the wait
it will be worth the wait

and feel your sunlight shining over me
