verse 1
is that music in my ear
its like i heard nothing for a thousand years
my eyes were closed locking in my tears

i was so surrounded but still all alone
a great big house but so far from home
howd you breathe life in this heart of soul

hook
its like i can feel its like i can breathe
its like i can live its like i can love
for the first time for the first time
for the first time for the first time

bridge
im electric finally exposed
you see through me strip off all my clothes
if this is falling then let me go oh

hook
its like i can feel its like i can breathe
its like i can live its like i can love
for the first time for the first time
for the first time for the first time

im finally awake and i can feel my heart
its beating like a drum when im right here where you are
i can feel it i can feel it oh
can you feel it

hook
its like i can feel its like i can breathe
its like i can live its like i can love
for the first time for the first time
for the first time for the first time
its like i can feel its like i can breathe
its like i can live its like i can love
for the first time for the first time
for the first time for the first time3embed"
