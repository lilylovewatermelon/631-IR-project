one two three

verse 1
there aint a thing in the world to take me back
like a darkhaired girl in a cadillac
on main street of an old forgotten town
and sunlight shines in fine white lines
on weathered stores with open signs
they may as well just close em down

chorus 1
and you look like 1968
or was it 69
when i heard you caught a bullet
well i guess youre doing fine
and you speak of revolution
like its some place that youve been
well youve been a long time gone
good to see you my old friend

verse 2
oh now that sun is gone away
replaced instead by silver rays
of moonlight falling on the avenue
oh and i could sleep if you would drive
i just cant keep my mind alive
and youve got nothin better else to do
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus 2
and weve all been lookin for you
like a hobo you walk in
oh how the mighty all have fallen
how the holy all have sinned
is that the clattering of sabers
or the cool september wind
well youve been a long time gone
good to see you my old friend

verse 3
and theres just two times of day like this
you find this kind of blissfulness
the sun it sets and rises in the morn
and were shakin hands i rub my eyes
free of all my alibis
just ablinking like the day that i was born

chorus 1
and you look like 1968
or was it 69
when i heard you caught a bullet
well i guess youre doing fine
and you speak of revolution
like its some place that youve been
well youve been a long time gone
good to see you my old friend
outro
and when the rounds were fired that april
you were on the balcony
when ten thousand teardrops ahit the ground
in memphis tennessee
you were a prideful rebel yell
among a million marching men
and youve been a long time gone
good to see you my old friend
well youve been a long time gone
good to see you my old friendembed"
