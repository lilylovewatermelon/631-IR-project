if i die young bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
ohoh ohoh

verse 1
lord make me a rainbow ill shine down on my mother
shell know im safe with you when she stands under my colors
oh and life aint always what you think it ought to be no
aint even gray but she buries her baby
the sharp knife of a short life
well ive had just enough time

chorus
if i die young bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

postchorus
the sharp knife of a short life
well ive had just enough time

verse 2
and ill be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
im as green as the ring on my little cold finger
ive never known the lovin of man
but it sure felt nice when he was holdin my hand
theres a boy here in town says hell love me forever
who would have thought forever could be severed by

so put on your best boys and ill wear my pearls
what i never did is done
a penny for my thoughtsâ€”oh no ill sell em for a dollar
theyre worth so much more after im a goner
and maybe then youll hear the words ive been singin
funny when youre dead how people start listenin

chorus
if i die young bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

outro
ooh ooh the ballad of a dove
go with peace and love
gather up your tears keep em in your pocket
save em for a time when youre really gonna need em
oh the sharp knife of a short life
well ive had just enough time
so put on your best boys and ill wear my pearls62embed"
