build your walls up high and wide
make it rain to keep them out

cultivate plant your seeds now and watch them grow

is that the sound of freedom now
cause its plain to see a mans integrity
by the way he treats those he does not need

lets not waste our common ground
we will fall for standing and watching all in silence
