we met down at the floating dock
she snuck out scared she might get caught
we were nervous but it was worth it
there was no such thing as consequence
with her in my arms it finally made sense
in that moonlight i saw her tan lines

chorus
every time my feet are dangling in the water
i cant help but think about her
lying there with her wet hair
didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
that old wooden dock was warm on our backs
tshirt for a pillow and just like that
she kissed me like she meant forever
we were too damn young to know any better

verse 2
the fog rolled in she said id better go
she took my tshirt and wore it home
a memory a souvenir she could keep
so i stayed and watched that sunrise
like it was waking up my life
to what love was i can still see us
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
every time my feet are dangling in the water
i cant help but think about her
lying there with her wet hair
didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
that old wooden dock was warm on our backs
tshirt for a pillow and just like that
she kissed me like she meant forever
we were too damn young to know any better

chorus
every time my feet are dangling in the water
i cant help but think about her
lying there with her wet hair
didnt know what we were doing but we didnt care
that old wooden dock was warm on our backs
tshirt for a pillow and just like that
she kissed me like she meant forever
we were too damn young to know any better
