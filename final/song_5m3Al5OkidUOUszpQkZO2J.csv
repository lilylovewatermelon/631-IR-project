as i sit here
and slowly close my eyes
i take another deep breath
and feel the wind pass through my body
im the one in your soul
reflecting inner light
protect the ones who hold you
cradling your inner child

chorus
i need serenity
in a place where i can hide
i need serenity
nothing changes days go by

postchorus
where do we go when we just dont know
and how do we relight the flame when its cold
why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
and when will we learn to control

verse 2
tragic visions
slowly stole my life
tore away everything
cheating me out of my time
im the one who loves you
no matter wrong or right
and every day i hold you
i hold you with my inner child

postchorus
where do we go when we just dont know
and how do we relight the flame when its cold
why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
and when will we learn to control

where do we go when we just dont know
and how do we relight the flame when its cold

and when will we learn to control i need serenity
where do we go when we just dont know i need serenity
and how do we relight the flame when its cold i need serenity
