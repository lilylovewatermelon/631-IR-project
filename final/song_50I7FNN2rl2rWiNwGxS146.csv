metro in this bitch goin brazy

verse 1
made it out the dirt i was head first
a nigga used to rob ayy and i used to serve
couldnt go to work school was the worst
pussy tried to play me ayy put him on a shirt
lambo real fast fell in love with cash
fell in love with head ayy i fell in love with ass
science i was sleep ayy i fell in love with math
she was at the club ayy i made her take a bath
ayy im king smoke so i got a drum on the stick
gang was in there i cant put my tongue on that shit
he was talkin crazy til that hollow hit his lip
ayy big 4l even the killers gettin killed
all you see is pateks and aps in my clique
wе got all the bottles and the hookah in thе vip
i might be a rapper but its thirty in this clip
ayy zone 6 we get niggas buried round this bitch

chorus
pitbull the way i walk way i talk
loose lips sink ships yellow tape white chalk
multitask use the pistol and the fork
screamin no opp left behind nigga we gon kill em all
aint no cap in my rap aint no flaw
you could tell it when i rap aint no cut this shit raw
cut him off if he talkin to the law
im with draco cause he quiet til he hit you in the jaw

my lil niggas dont wanna trap they wanna spin
ayy spin fill the choppas up then spin again
free my dawg he not ink so why he in a pen
from atlanta not vegas but i still sin
ayy chain like a yoyo ride me like a pogo
she from out of dc when she fuck me she play gogo
used to sip lines now a nigga sippin fours though
niggas rappin gangsta but they really hoes though
street niggas streets dont talk but you told though
rattail hangin in the hood boy you bold bold
we aint tryna hear bout all the bricks that you sold sold
they dont need a badge but them niggas still the popo
focused on my bag focused on my money
i done had some dark days i done had some sunny
niggas think they hot i think niggas funny
ayy yellow baguette vvvvss look like honey
all my diamonds pissed on ayy andre drummond
my playa wont even pull inside the partments cause they haunted
my dawg couldve passed me the ball but he punted
got my turn did a onside kick thats how im comin

chorus
pitbull the way i walk way i talk
loose lips sink ships yellow tape white chalk
multitask use the pistol and the fork
screamin no opp left behind nigga we gon kill em all
aint no cap in my rap aint no flaw
you could tell it when i rap aint no cut this shit raw
cut him off if he talkin to the law
im with draco cause he quiet til he hit you in the jaw
outro
multitask use the pistol and the fork
screamin no opp left behind nigga we gon kill em all
multitask use the pistol and the fork
screamin no opp left behind nigga we gon kill em all
aint no cap in my rap aint no flaw
you could tell it when i rap aint no cut this shit raw
cut him off if he talkin to the law
im with draco cause he quiet til he hit you in the jaw

skit morgan freeman
a wise man knows not to have a lot of enemies
the friction of constant conflict is a distraction in life
and left unchecked can end up being what subtracts him from life
if possible all enemies should be eliminated13embed"
