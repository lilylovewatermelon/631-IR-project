im a long way from the land that i left
ive been running through life and cruising toward death
if you think that im scared youve got me wrong
if you dont know my name youll know it now
i belong bodily to the earth
im just wearing old bones from those that came first
there are many more flames when mine is gone
they will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

verse 2
im a long way from the one that i loved
ive been tending old flames lamenting what was
drifting in a land that time forgot
if you think that ive changed you know me not
i belong bodily to the earth
im just wearing old bones from those that came first
i been unraveling since my birth
gonna wander out there and see what im worth

chorus
follow me way out there
theres no road that will lead us back
when you follow the strange trails
they will take you to who knows where
if i found a way to stay with you tonight
it would only make me late for a date i cant escape

follow me way out there
theres no road that will lead us back
when you follow the strange trails
they will take you to who knows where
if i found a way to stay with you tonight
it would only make me late for a date i cant escape1embed"
