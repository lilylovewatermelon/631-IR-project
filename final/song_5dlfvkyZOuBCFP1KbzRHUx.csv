im an orange moon
reflecting the light of the sun
many nights he was alone
many many many nights
his light was too bright so they turned away
and he stood alone
every night and every day

then he turned to me
he saw his reflection in me
and he smiled at me when he turned to me
then he said to me

how good it is how good it is
how good it is how good it is

im an orange moon
im brighter than before
brighter than ever before
im an orange moon and i shine so bright
cause i reflect the light of my sun

i praise the day he turned my way
and smiled at me
he gets to smile and i get to be orange

how good it is how good it is
how good it is how good it is
how good it is how good it is
how good he is how god he is

how good it is how good it is
how good he is how god he is
how good it is how good it is
how good he is how god he is
how good it is how good it is
