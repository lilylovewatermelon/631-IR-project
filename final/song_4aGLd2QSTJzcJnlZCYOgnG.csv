verse 1
when youre on the top
theres no place you can really go but down down down
people on the street congratulate you
they say they love the way you sound

wherewhen youre on the low
no one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
your agents never there
your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
standing on the top

chorus the temptations  rick james

verse 2
when youre on the top
everyone you meet they wanna be your long lost friend
they say how great you are a superstar
but do you have any money to lend
