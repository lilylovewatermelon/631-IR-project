verse 1
so tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
before i start this dance
i take a chance in telling you
i want more than just romance
you are my destiny
i cant let go baby cant you see
cupid please take your aim at me

chorus
cherish the thought
of always having you here by my side
oh baby i cherish the joy
you keep bringing it into my life
im always singing it cherish your strength
you got the power to make me feel good
and baby i perish the thought
of ever leaving i never would

verse 2
i was never satisfied with casual encounters
i cant hide my need
for two hearts that bleed
with burning love
thats the way its got to be
romeo and juliet they never felt this way i bet
so dont underestimate my point of view
