verse 1 big tc
all my life
once say they love you why they make you cry
said theyd never leave oh how theyve lied
gave up my loyalty and paid the price
got me asking why
these people wrong you but you done them right
they giving up and all you do is fight
you sacrifice and you would even die

chorus big tc
and i thank god
for never leaving me alone
even when im on my own
wont break im standing strong
and i thank god
for showing the road to go
when im weak and feeling low
built tough it never show yeah
see yg liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likeverse 2 rjmrla
im sorry ms jackson i hate to call in this fashion
i understand its late and you work harder than average
plus im knowing that you and your son have been clashing
but keenon called and told me to tell you what happened
he hit a lick with his homies his homie switched it on him
they spent the money he got greedy pulled a pistol on him
shots fired from both sides but nobody died
i thank god he survived and got out alive
but this gon hurt you to hear
keenon went to jail might be facing some years
police say its evidence he broke in someones residence
the neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
they say the bail like fifty thou
but its gon be like five thousand to get him out
man i told him not to fuck with them niggasâ€”
im sorry i dont mean to curse but i just never trust em at all
and he up in the pound with my dawg
and his girl aint accepting his call
cant let him fight the charge in his cell he need bail on me
i got two we just need the other three fight the case on his feet
