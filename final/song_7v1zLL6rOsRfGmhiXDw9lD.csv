raindrops from the clouds
sun lights up the sky
hummingbirds do fly

verse 1 lil wayne
ooh girl i love you so
good lord almighty i’m in love with a whitey
i call her aphrodite i call her when i need her
and she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
life is just like moving mountains
when i can’t cope i’m hittin’ that slope
that great white hope and it aint no pressure
i can’t feel nothing but i never felt better
hmm but you were just no good for me
killin’ me softly that girl is poison
huh i had to let you go take things slow
just so you know

chorus kevin rudolf
i’ll do it all again if i had the chance
don’t feel the pain don’t feel the pain
like novacane like novacane
i’ll take the whole world on i’m feeling so strong
don’t feel the pain don’t feel the pain
like novacane like novacane

you used to make me feel so good
like i was on top of the world
im sorry that i gotta stay away from ya
but thats what the doctor prefered
my friends told me leave you alone
and i just told em leave me alone
its sad our thing had to end
the relationship was short and sweet nia long
and i see her in the streets
but i cant bring her home

verse 3 lil wayne
sweet sugar hill yeah i used to climb her
i never imagined shed turn out to be but a cheap thrill
that sweet turned to sour she gave me power
the world was ours
i used to feel invincible on that flour
but i had to change yeah i had to change
so i left her for a bitch named mary jane
now everythings cool everythings fine
girl im moving on i done left you behind
every now and then you pop up on my mind
i might fuck you one last time cause—
chorus kevin rudolf  lil wayne
i’ll do it all again if i had the chance
