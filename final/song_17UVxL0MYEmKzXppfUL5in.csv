the only thing that keeps me from driving this car
halflight jack knife into the canyon at night
signs and wonders perseus aligned with the skull
slain medusa pegasus alight from us all

chorus 1
do i care if i survive this bury the dead where they’re found
in a veil of great surprises i wonder did you love me at all

verse 2
the only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
cross hatch warm bath holiday inn after dark
signs and wonders water stain riding the wall
daniel’s message blood of the moon on us all

chorus 2
do i care if i despise this nothing else matters i know
in a veil of great disguises how do i live with your ghost

bridge
should i tear my eyes out now
everything i see returns to you somehow
should i tear my heart out now
everything i feel returns to you somehow
i want to save you from your sorrow
you might also likeverse 3
the only reason why i continue at all
faith in reason i wasted my life playing dumb
signs and wonders sea lion caves in the dark
blind faith god’s grace nothing else left to impart

chorus 3
do i care if i survive this bury the dead where they’re found
in a veil of great surprises hold to my head till i drown
should i tear my eyes out now before i see too much
should i tear my arms out now i wanna feel your touch

outro
should i tear my eyes out now
everything i see returns to you somehow
should i tear my heart out now
everything i feel returns to you somehow38embed"
