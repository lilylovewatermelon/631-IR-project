i learned quick my eighteenth summer
digging ditches for the man
you cant be a guitar strummer
cussing that shovel in your hand

verse 2
took my paycheck to a pawn shop
bought a silver tone guitar
wrote a song about a beer joint
went and played it in a bar

chorus
its hard as hell out on this highway
but im still addicted to the show
when that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
a gypsy drifting down the road

verse 3
buses trucks and lit up stages
angel faces with no names
stadium of saving graces
stand and singing with a flame

chorus
its hard as hell out on this highway
but im still addicted to the show
when that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
a gypsy drifting down the road
you might also likebridge
i go on when im too tired to sleep
and i go on sing when i cant speak
i go on and on and on and on

verse 4
its hard as hell out on this highway
but im still addicted to the show
when that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
a gypsy drifting down the road
and when that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
a gypsy drifting down the road down the roadembed"
