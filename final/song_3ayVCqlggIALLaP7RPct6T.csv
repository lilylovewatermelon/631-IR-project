the feeling just hit
where did the time get to
some 31 days on the road
one more show to do
im standing on the side of the stage
about to walk on
ill give them all that i have
oh then babe im coming home

chorus
give me one more day baby
im almost on my way baby
i know how much you give
i know how much i take

verse 2
and i know that one more day
feels so long
and i feel it just as deep
honey just as strong
i know i tend to get lost
in this world i live in
but nothing out here satisfies
yeah baby i know what im missing

outro
yeah the feeling just hit
where did the time get to
im staring out a crowd
but when i close my eyes
all i see is youx2embed"
