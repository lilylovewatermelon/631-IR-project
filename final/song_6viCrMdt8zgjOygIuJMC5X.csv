ohoh no ohoh no
ohoh no ohoh no

verse 1
they said hey girl will you sit with me
table in the back cafeteria c
we can be friends if you want to be
but only til the clock hits three
after lunch we can walk to class
talk about the boys that we want to smash
talk about ways to get a little more cash
after that ill ignore your ass oh

prechorus
the hassle the fightin they all want a bite of me
photos more photos
then gossip bout hoes that they dont know
oh they talk shit though

chorus
i dont want no lunchbox friends no
i want someone who understands oh no
come to my house lets die together
friendship that will last forever no
no lunchbox friends no no
no lunchbox friends
come to my house lets die together
friendship that will last forever no

verse 2
they want a fat ass in their brandnew jeans
want a baby in the back with the man of their dreams
that isnt the life for me
gotta look like a fuckin damn barbie
goin on tv people have high expectations of me
wanna be my best friend then judge me if i smoke a little weed
makes no fuckin sense to me
