i can only give you love that lasts forever
and a promise to be near each time you call
and the only heart i own
for you and you alone
thats all
thats all

verse 2
i can only give you country walks in springtime
and a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
and a love whose burning light
will warm the winter night
thats all
thats all

there are those i am sure who have told you
they would give you the world for a toy
all i have are these arms to enfold you
and a love time can never destroy

verse 3
if youre wondering what im asking in return dear
youll be glad to know that my demands are small
say its me that youll adore
for now and evermore
thats all
thats all
