sure its a calming notion perpetual in motion
but i dont need the comfort of any lies
for i have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise
oh back when i was younger was told by other youngsters
that my end will be torture beneath the earth
cause i dont see what they see when death is staring at me
i see a window a limit to live it or not at all

verse 2
if you could pull the lever to carry on forever
would your life even matter anymore
sure its a calming notion perpetual in motion
but its not what you signed up for

im sure there wont always be sunshine
but theres this momentary beam of light
you dont have to wait those salty decades
to get through the gate its all in front of your face
im sure there wont always be sunshine
im sure there wont always be sunshine
but theres this momentary beam of light

i could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion
im sure there wont always be sunshine
for every shining second this fragile body beckons
but theres this momentary beam of light
you think youre owed it better believing ancient letters
im sure there wont always be sunshine
sure its a calming notion but its a lie
but theres this momentary beam of light25embed"
