what if i told you that i got sober
that i got older
that i got that tattoo off my shoulder
that im strong again im fun again
would you love me then

what if you saw me
what if you hate me
what if im failing
or mentally ill
would you call me crazy
would you let me in would you let me in
would you love me then

chorus
i told you that my whole life
couldve sworn i would die young
my last words twenty two years on my tongue
im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck
you know that i spend long nights brain fried talking too much
im a boozebag dobad burnout dead drunk
yeah im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck

whoa

see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
its not your fault that my brain is vacant
that the world is trash and my dumb ass just got completely wasted
you washed your hands of all my sins
have i lost you then

sometimes i hate it
my lack of patience
how sometimes love feels like a noun in some new foreign language
and now my heart is bent and worn so thin
can you sew the skin

chorus
i told you that my whole life
couldve sworn i would die young
my last words twenty two years on my tongue
im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck
you know that i spend long nights brain fried talking too much
im a boozebag dobad burnout dead drunk
yeah im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck

whoa
whoa
whoa whoa

bridge
so if you look back
and you hate my past
just know im doing everything that i can
im doing everything that i can
and if you look back
and cant stand my ass
i swear im doing everything that i can
im doing everything that i can
chorus
i told you that my whole life
couldve sworn i would die young
my last words twenty two years on my tongue
im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck
you know that i spend long nights brain fried talking too much
im a boozebag dobad burnout dead drunk
yeah im bad luck im bad luck im bad luck1embed"
