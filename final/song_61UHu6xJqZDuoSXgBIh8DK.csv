im holding on so tightly now
my insides scream so loud
they keep watching watching me drown
how did it come to this
how did it come to this how did i know it was you
it was a bad dream asphyxiated watch me bleed
the life support was cut the knot was too tight
they push and pull me but they know theyll never win

chorus deuce with johnny 3 tears  da kurlzz
throw it all away throw it all away
i keep on screaming but theres really nothing left to say
so get away just get away
i keep on fighting but i cant keep going on this way

verse 2 deuce  jdog
i cant keep going cant keep going on like this
they make me sick and i get so sick of it
cause they wont let me they wont let me breathe
why cant they let me be
why cant they let me be why dont i know what i am
i force this hate into my heart cause its my only friend
my lips are sewn shut i watch myself bleed
they push and pull me and its killing me within

postchorus deuce
i cant keep going cant keep going on this way
i cant keep going cant keep going on this way

bridge johnny 3 tears
my heartbeat stumbles and my backbone crumbles
i feel is it real as the lynch mob doubles
they want blood and theyll kill for it drain me and theyll kneel for it
burn me at the stake met the devil made the deal for it
guillotine dreams yeah their guillotine gleams
the blood of their enemies watching while they sentence me
sentencing ceased sentence deceased
and watch them bask in the glory of their holy disease

chorus deuce with johnny 3 tears  da kurlzz
throw it all away throw it all away
i keep on screaming but theres really nothing left to say
so get away just get away
i keep on fighting but i cant keep going on this way
outro deuce
i keep on running i keep on running
i keep on running but i cant keep going on this way
i keep on running i keep on running
i keep on running but i cant keep going on this way15embed"
