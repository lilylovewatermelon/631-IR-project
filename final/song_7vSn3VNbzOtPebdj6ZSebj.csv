well you know those times when you feel like theres a sign there on your back
that says i dont mind if you kick me seems like everybody has
things go from bad to worse you think they cant get worse than that and then they do

verse 2
you step off the straight and narrow and you dont know where you are
used the needle of your compass to sew up your broken heart
ask directions from a genie in a bottle of jim beam
and she lies to you
thats when youll learn the truth

chorus
if youre goin through hell keep on going
dont slow down if youre scared dont show it
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there

verse 3
ive been deep down in that darkness
ive been down to my last match
felt a hundred different demons breathin fire down my back
and i knew that if i stumbled id fall right into the trap
that they were layin yeah
but the good news is theres angels everywhere out on the street
holdin out a hand to pull you back up on your feet
the ones that youve been draggin for so long
youre on your knees you might as well be prayin
guess what im sayin
you might also likechorus
if youre goin through hell keep on going
dont slow down if youre scared dont show it
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there
yeah if youre goin through hell keep on movin
face that fire walk right through it
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there

instrumental

chorus
if youre goin through hell keep on going
dont slow down if youre scared dont show it
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there
yeah if youre goin through hell keep on movin
face that fire walk right through it
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there
you might get out before the devil even knows youre there yeah1embed"
