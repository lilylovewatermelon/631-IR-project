comin out of my cage and i been doin just fine
gotta gotta be down because i want it all
it started out with a kiss how did it end up like this
it was only a kiss it was only a kiss
now im fallin asleep and shes callin a cab
while hes havin a smoke and shes takin a drag
now theyre goin to bed and my stomach is sick
and its all in my head

prechorus
but shes touchin his chest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go
and i just cant look its killin me
and takin control

chorus
jealousy turnin saints into the sea
swimmin through sick lullabies
chokin on your alibis
but its just the price i pay
destiny is callin me
open up my eager eyes
cause im mr brightside
