can you tell me who called a race
can anyone stay in one place
and when you get to the finish line
will you wish for more time
but see one day
one day you will
but maybe one day you will find
that you just canâ€™t push rewind

chorus
all we have is this moment
tomorrows unspoken
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me
all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me
be here with me now

verse 2
do you ever think that were just chasing our tails
like life is one big fast treadmill
and we pop what is prescribed
if it gets us first prize
but you know who i who i think will win
are the ones that let love in
are the ones that take the time

all we have is this moment
tomorrows unspoken
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me
all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me

bridge
be here with me now
be here with me now
cause the future is right now right in front on you
dont let the clock the clock tell you what to do
our future is right now im in front of you
baby dont blink and miss this moment

chorus
tomorrows unspoken
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me
all we have is this moment
to put a love into motion
yesterday is history
so why dont you be here with me
be here with me now8embed"
