we keep behind closed doors
every time i see you i die a little more
stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
itll never be enough
as you drive me to my house
i cant stop these silent tears from rolling down
you and i both have to hide on the outside
where i cant be yours and you cant be mine

prechorus jade
but i know this
we got a love that is hopeless

chorus jade
why cant i hold you in the street
why cant i kiss you on the dance floor
i wish that it could be like that
why cant it be like that
cause im yours
why cant i say that im in love
i wanna shout it from the rooftops
i wish that it could be like that
why cant it be like that
cause im yours
