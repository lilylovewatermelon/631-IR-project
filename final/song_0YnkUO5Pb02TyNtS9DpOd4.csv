now this is my job i will not quit it
pulled me out the depths when i thought that i was finished
yeah i questioned if i could go the distance
thats just the work regardless of whos listening listening
listen see i was meant to be a warrior
fight something amongst me leave here victorious
classroom of kids or a venue performing
if id done it for the money id have been a fucking lawyer
concrete vagabond van telling stories
humbled by the road im realizing im not important
see lifes a beautiful struggle i record it
hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
thats why we stay in the lab at night
ive been staring into this pad for over half my life
a true artist wont be satisfied
so i guess thats the sacrifice
and i say

chorus
make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
uh ill forever remain faithful
all my people stay true
i said make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
uh ill forever remain faithful
all my people stay true

forget about the fame fortune and the mansion
sitting and trippin watching myself on a plasma
yeah i start slippin when im thinkin about that stuff
ego once swollen til karma catches that up that up
im my grandmas number one grandson
i lost myself to remember who that was
we start thinkin about some kicks necklace
what i really need is a job off craigslist
take away the dot com name love
fans twitter followers and the buzz
see you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
and i had to find out who i really was
uh who i really wasnt
so sick of who i was becoming
yeah tired of running
time to look at the man in the mirror until i can learn to love him

chorus
make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
uh ill forever remain faithful
all my people stay true
i said make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
uh ill forever remain faithful
all my people stay true

of course i want dubs and a candypainted lac
watch the videos and get the girls in the back
but if thats what i believe in and the reason that i rap
uncle sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
of course i want dubs and a candypainted lac
watch the videos and get the girls in the back
but if thats what i believe in and the reason that i rap
uncle sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track

chorus
make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
ill forever remain faithful
stay true stay true
and i said make the money dont let the money make you
change the game dont let the game change you
ill forever remain faithful
stay true stay true stay true

ill forever remain faithful
