this is tha carter ii people
hey

verse
they call me mr carter i kissed the daughter
of the deads forehead i killed the father
spilled the heart of a mildew hater
i will put them body on chill like glaciers gracias
im crazy yes its obvious
going against me is atheist
i got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
i aint sniffing im just pitching your honor
i aint snitching your honor
hate bitch niggas bitches with power
vacate when that kitchen get hotter
i just sit on the counter
open the cabinet close the cupboard
put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles
i remember being young tryna hustle my dope
tryna tell the old junkies that my crack aint soap
tryna tell you fore you jump that my mac aint broke
you aint tryna see how far that black back lane go no
call me pacman your ghost is blue
i got my red river rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
usually im a hooligan for the money
yeah im eating but i got a tapeworm in my tummy oh
make harm and i bomb you in public
hit you with the straightarm no warning nothing
look its morning no yawning or nothing
i aint sleeping im up tryna take a nigga lunch
you gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts
then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
im so 504 you got to kill me here
if you ever looking for me bitch i will be here
cash money is an army navy seal me here
lot of niggas ran from me but i still be here
no chrome on the continental im so fundamental
crack the phil crack the roof and roll up the windows
and my hood love me they tell me bring it home
thats why i holler hollygrove on each and every song
you leaping at a dog a dog with no bark
just a bite like an old shark
and all you rich niggas know pa im talking bout stunna
he like keep your dough he got your ho
and the sun shines on the king and sets on the prince
