my hands wrapped around a stick shift
swerving on the 405 i can never keep my eyes off this
my neck the feeling of your soft lips
illuminated in the light bouncing off the exit signs i missed

chorus
all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive
and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and now were singing

breakdown
ah ah ahah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah ah

spoken word
umm hey i was just wondering if you wanna like… never mind thank you bye
you might also likeverse 2
your laugh echoes down the highway
carves into my hollow chest spreads over the emptiness
its bliss
its so simple but we cant stay
over analyze again would it really kill you if we kissed
chorus
all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive
and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and now were singing

breakdown
ah ah ahah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ahah ah ah ah
