she got eyes that cut you like a knife
and her lips that taste like sweet red wine
and her pretty legs go to heaven every time
she got a gentle way that puts me at ease
and when she walks in the room i can hardly breathe
got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

chorus
she got whatever it is it blows me away
shes everything i wanna say to a woman but i couldnt find the words to say
she got whatever it is i dont know what to do
cause every time i try and tell her how i feel it comes out i love you
you got whatever it is

verse 2
you know ive never been the type that would ever wanna stay
bring em home at night and theyre gone the next day
but that all changed when she walked into my life
and people ask me what it is tell em i dont know
theres just something bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
and shes gonna be my wife

chorus
she got whatever it is it blows me away
shes everything i wanna say to a woman but i couldnt find the words to say
she got whatever it is i dont know what to do
cause every time i try and tell her how i feel it comes out i love you
you got whatever it is
