i guess i like it when we play
the way you drag me down
i guess i like it when you hate me
the way you drag me down
cause i cant face myself in a mirror
im left alone with all my pain
and i disgrace myself in the mirror
im left alone with my shame

chorus
fuck it
i see you in me
fuck it
i feel you in me
fuck it
ill heal you in me

fuck it
i see you in me
fuck it
i feel you in me
fuck it
ill heal you in me

verse 2
i guess i like it when we fight
the way you drag me down
i guess i like it when you smite me
the way you drag me down
cause i cant face myself in a mirror
im left alone with all my pain
and i disgrace myself in the mirror
im left alone with my shame
