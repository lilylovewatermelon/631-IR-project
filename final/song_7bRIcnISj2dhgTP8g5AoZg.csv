heres to the judges of john roberts
who wear the robe of honor in a phony legal form
and justices are stranger when the partisans report
when the court elected a president it was the beginning of this war

chorus
heres to the land you tore out the heart of
john roberts find yourself another country to be part of

verse 2
heres to the government of dick cheney
with criminals posing as advisers to the crown
and they hope that no one sees the sites or that no one hears the sounds
cause the speeches of our president are the ravings of a clown

chorus
heres to the land you tore out the heart of
dick cheney find yourself another country to be part of

verse 3
heres to the churches of jerry falwell
oh the cross once made of silver now is turned to rust
and the sunday morning services preach in fear of men in love
and god only knows in heaven they must trust
you might also likechorus
heres to the land you tore out the heart of
jerry falwell find yourself another country to be part of

verse 4
heres to the laws of alberto gonzalez
congress will pass an act in the panic of the day
and the constitutions drowning in an ocean of decay
and freedom of speech is dangerous ive even heard them say

chorus
heres to the land you tore out the heart of
gonzalez find yourself another country to be part of

verse 5
heres to the businessmen of george w
wholl want to change the focus from halliburton to enron
and their profits like blood money spilled out on the white house lawn
to keep their hold on power theyre using terror as a con
while the bombs that fall on children dont know which side dont care which side that theyre on

chorus
heres to the land you tore out the heart of
george w find yourself another country to be part of

heres to the land youve torn out the heart of
george w find yourself another country to be part ofembed"
