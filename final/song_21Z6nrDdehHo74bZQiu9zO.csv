a reckless love too wild to understand
breathing the world to life in your romance

prechorus
so here i am
your love has got me up in arms again
and this hope wont let me go

chorus 1
my joy is boundless
my soul knows its worth
in arms stretching wider
than my heart could ever fall

verse 2
you own the skies and still you want my heart
casting your throne aside to lift me up

prechorus
so here i am
your love has got me up in arms again
and this hope wont let me go

chorus 2
my joy is boundless
my soul knows its worth
in arms stretching wider
than my heart could ever fall
your word is final
your name above all
the cross my reminder
your love is forever
cause here i am
your love has got me up in arms again
and this hope wont let me go
my joy is boundless
my soul knows its worth
in arms stretching wider
than my heart could ever fall
your word is final
your name above all
the cross my reminder
your love is forever
cause here i am
your love has got me up in arms again
and this hope wont let me go
