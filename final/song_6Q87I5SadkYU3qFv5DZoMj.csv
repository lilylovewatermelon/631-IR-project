i want to be your friend
flowers grow through my window and i love you again
oh i love you oh
when you laid me down into your beautiful garden
flowers in the love of my arms
its god shining through to me i guess

its god shining through to me i guess
i love you amy

do you still love me
i go to the places where we used to
i feel sad

i am out here looking for you

sometimes i pretend
oh i miss you oh
when you laid me down
into your beautiful garden
flowers and the love in my arms
is god playing evil tricks on me

is god playing evil tricks on me
oh i love you amy
you might also likedo you still love meembed"
