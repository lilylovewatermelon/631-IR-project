i try so many times but its not taking me
and it seems so long ago that i i used to believe
and im im lost inside of my head and crazy
but i cant get out of it
im just stumbling

prechorus
and im juggling all the thoughts in my head
im juggling and my fears on fire
but im listening as it evolved in my head
im balancing on one fine wire

chorus
and i remember the time my balance was fine
and i was just walking on one fine wire
and i remember the time my balance was fine
and i was just walking on one fine wire
but its frayed at both the ends
and im slow unraveling

verse 2
life plays such silly games inside of me mm
and ive had some distant cries following
and theyre entwined between the night and sun beams
i wish i were free from this pain in me
