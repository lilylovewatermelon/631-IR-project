just try to understand this isnt what i planned
this rides out of my hands
so now im forced to be something i can not be
if only i could make you see

chorus
tonight im alive
ive watched you all grow up and so have i

thats forced upon my plate

alone if only i could make you see

chorus
tonight im alive
ive watched you all grow up and so have i
inside
this isnt really what i had in mind
