ive been known to kiss and tell
send girls to wishing wells
if youre my man i want you to myself
i know ill have enemies long as youre into me
but i dont care cause i got what i need
oh yeah need to get with the program
boy i keep you close like slow dance
hit you with that red dont go there no no man
met him then get him i make sure we stay
got the venom to dead him if he want a snake
i mean sneak i mean play hide and seek
know that im gonna find you
make sure you get left or you lеave

prechorus rosé jisoo
i saw you
and knew what i was trying to do
i had to play it real rеal smooth
and once i finally made my move

feels wrong but its right right
blacked out no night light
pinked out like fight night
maxed out of my mind
and the price right
might buy might bite
never the regular degular
would clean my mess up
but id rather mess it up
simple is soso i need that oh no
dont you know im loco

prechorus jisoo rosé
i saw you
and knew what i was trying to do
i had to play it real real smooth
and once i finally made my move

chorus jennie lisa jisoo

over you only you ah ah
i went crazy over you
like eeee eeee eeee

bridge jennie rosé
