another ringer with the slick trigger finger for her majesty
another one with the golden tongue poisoning your fantasy
another bill from a killer turned a thriller to a tragedy

chorus jack white  alicia keys
yeah a door left open a woman walking by
a drop in the water a look in your eye
a phone on the table a man on your side
or someone that you think that you can trust
its just another way to die

verse 2 jack white  alicia keys
another tricky little gun giving solace to the one
thatll never see the sun shine
another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
another dirty money heaven sent honey turning on a dime

chorus jack white  alicia keys
well a door left open a woman walking by
a drop in the water a look in your eye
a phone on the table a man on your side
or someone that you think that you can trust
its just another way to die

bridge jack white  alicia keys

another girl with her finger on the world
singing to you what you wanna hear
another gun thrown down in surrender took away your fear hey
another man there he stands right behind you looking in the mirror

chorus jack white  alicia keys
a door left open a woman walking by
a drop in the water a look in the eye
a phone on the table a man on your side
or someone that you think that you can trust
its just another way to die

outro jack white  alicia keys
