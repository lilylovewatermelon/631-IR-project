im not calling you a liar
just dont lie to me
im not calling you a thief
just dont steal from me
im not calling you a ghost
just stop haunting me
and i love you so much
im going to let you kill me

chorus
theres a ghost in my lungs
and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my tongue
as it softly speaks
then it walks then it walks
with my legs
to fall to fall
to fall at your feet

postchorus
oh but for the grace of god go on
and when you kiss me im happy enough to die

verse 2
im not calling you a liar
just dont lie to me
and i love you so much
im going to let you kill me
im not calling you a thief
just stop—
and i love you so much
im going to let you—
im not calling you a ghost
just stop—

to fall to fall to fall to fall
to fall to fall at your feet
