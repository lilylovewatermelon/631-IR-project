i know you dont want me anymore
by the look on your face
they say when it rains it pours
you can tell by my face

prechorus normani camila
oh and i know
and you know that weve been here before
i think i know how it should end
weve got an audience callin us crazy
we ignore

were not like the rest of them
friends with insanity as of lately

chorus lauren
everyone comes with scars
but you can love them away

i think thats why we belong
together and unashamed
i told you that i wasnt perfect no way
