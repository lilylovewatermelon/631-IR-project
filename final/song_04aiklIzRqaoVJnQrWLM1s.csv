drove half way to town last night and i turned around
in a field of fireflies makin such a lonely sound
as my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
i realized that i was livin in a new zip code

chorus
well im livin in lonesome usa
population one since yesterday
livin and dyin in the hell i made since you been gone
right now my minds in another state
aint enough heart here left to break
im livin in lonesome  lonesome usa

verse 2
i never knew the sound of silence could be so loud
its hard gettin used to livin in an empty house
yeah i know i can come and go any time i please
but there is somethin i miss about you waitin up on me

chorus
well im livin in lonesome usa
population one since yesterday
livin and dyin in the hell i made since you been gone
right now my minds in another state
aint enough heart here left to break
im livin in lonesome lonesome usa

and still be just as lost til you come back
hey i look around here and it dont take long to see
oh where i am right nows no place to be
