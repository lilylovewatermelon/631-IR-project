a saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
she said it was her first time to see the sea
helping her climb across those jetty rocks
was the first time i touched her hand
the rain and the way that felt never let up all week

prechorus
by thursday i knew everything about her
and god the last day i didnt want to leave without her

chorus
the sidewalks the streets were soaked
the sky was gray but you should have seen her face
shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand

verse 2
time was like the tide it came and went
that old pier ran clear out into the mist
my mind plays back that tuesday night again and again and again
i taste that saltwater taffy on her lips

prechorus
wednesday morning snuck in through the window
we just laid there and listened to the waves come and go
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
the sidewalks the streets were soaked
the sky was gray but you should have seen her face
shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand

bridge
moments with her now theyre all a blur
except for every second and every word
every drop of rain every single grain of sand

chorus
the sidewalks the streets were soaked
the sky was gray but you should have seen her face
shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand  times

outro
seven days a thousand times
a thousand times
seven days a thousand timesembed"
