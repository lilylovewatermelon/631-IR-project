mmm mmm

verse 1
falling leaves
like a blanket at my feet
theres a canopy of stars
and i just miss you like crazy
suddenly the worlds too big
and the hours move too slow
and i just wish that you were holding me near

verse 2
seven days
it feels like a year
you whisper through the line
you know i miss you like crazy
so baby can you steal a plane a boat the fastest train
you know it just dont feel the same when youre gone

chorus
cause every time you go away
the sunshine starts to fade
frozen by the hands of time into a permanent monday
take me back into your arms
and dont ever let me go
cause when i see you walk through that door
im not lost anymore
im home
im home

i wont sleep
until youre finally next to me
cant wait to breathe you in
dont wanna waste my time dreaming
i just wanna trace your name
like a whisper on my skin
and never have to say goodbye again

chorus
cause every time you go away
the sunshine starts to fade
frozen by the hands of time into a permanent monday
take me back into your arms
and dont ever let me go
cause when i see you walk through that door
im not lost anymore
im home

bridge
cause when i feel you right here close to me
everything is where its supposed to be
baby

chorus
every time you go away
the sunshine starts to fade
frozen by the hands of time into a permanent monday
take me back into your arms
and dont ever let me go
cause when i see you walk through that door
im not lost anymore
im home
outro
i am home ooh
yes i am
mmm
and i miss you like crazyembed"
