so i changed huh
you got a phone
pick it up call me

chorus eminem
how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
after all the years weve been down
aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you

verse 1 eminem
we were so young so full of life and vibrance
side by side wherever you was riding i went
so close almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
when ronnie died you was right by my side
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
you even had the same type of childhood i did
sometimes i just wanna know why is it
that you succame to yours and mine i survived it
you ran the streets i ninetofived it
we grew up grew apart as time went by us
then i blew up to both yours and mines surprises
now i feel a vibe i just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it
youre cold your touch is just like ice
and your eyes is a look of resentment
i can sense it and i dont like it
you might also likechorus eminem
how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
after all the years weve been down
aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you

verse 2 kon artis
it was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse
fore i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
fore i let him disrespect me or check me over some worrisome
bitch that i wasnt with i woulda hit it and quit
but you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
i told you dont get involved with her
you would smoke in the car with her
coming out of the bar with her stumbling halfdrunk
like yall was husband and wife or something
but me catching her fuckin other niggas
mustve hurt your pride or something
cause you woof off at the mouth to people
like you want it with me
when all i tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
and ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
you acting like i aint your mans and lying like she cant be loose
but i am really your friend im just trying to tell you the truth
dont hate the game or the player the one thats changing is you
chorus eminem
how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
after all the years weve been down
aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you

verse 3 proof  eminem
it gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
now we acting like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
fools i used to rap with all expect magic
like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
but proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
shady made it so my babies aint starving at home
see the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
forever real intelligence thats forever til the end
i peep the hatreds in your eyes and the satan in your lies
aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
how come when you talk its with bitter and spite
and how come it was my fault for what you did with your life
and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
we barely embrace you cant even look me in my face
chorus eminem
how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
after all the years weve been down
aint no way no how this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you you you you you22embed"
