Jean Deaux),"Isaiah Rashad, Jean Deaux",6JF49ixyHmOgS0Rsda2k42,"2 contributorsmy review of “cilvia demo” by isaiah rashad lyricsalright so i havent ever done one of these before so this is probably going to be a long one note that i am writing this as i listen to this album for the first time
so isaiah rashad until the 2013 bet cypher i had never heard of the guy i didnt even know anything about him other than he was a new rapper signed to top dawg entertainment which is one of the biggest labels in music right now i also knew that he was from a small town in tennessee chattanooga but i didnt really have anything to judge him off of than than his cypher performance and did i like his verse at first the answer is well no i didnt really care for his verse at all but i nevertheless was still kinda interested to say the least to see what his debut project cilvia would sound like so when the album dropped on january 28th 2014 although i wasnt dying to get a download link i still wanted to at least give the guy a listen i mean he was signed to tde so i had to check the dude out
