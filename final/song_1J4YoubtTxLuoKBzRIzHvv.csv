they say taylor was a good girl never one to be late
complain express ideas in her brain
workin on the night shift passin out the tickets
youre gonna have to pay her if you wanna park here
well mommys little dancer has quite a little secret
workin on the streets now never gonna keep it
its quite an imposition and now shes only wishin
that she would have listened to the words they said
poor taylor

chorus 1
well she just wanders around unaffected by
the winter winds yeah and shell pretend that
well shes somewhere else so far and clear
about 2000 miles from here

verse 2
well peter patrick pitterpatters on the window
but sunny silhouette wont let him in
and poor old petes got nothin cause hes been fallin
but somehow sunny knows just where hes been
he thinks that singin on a sunday gonna save his soul
now that saturdays gone
well sometimes he thinks that hes on his way
but i can see that his brake lights are on
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus 2
and he just wanders around unaffected by
the winter winds yeah and hell pretend that
well hes somewhere else so far and clear
about 2000 miles from here

verse 3
such a tough enchilada filled up with nada
givin what you gotta give to get a dollar bill
used to be a limber chicken times abeen atickin
now shes finger lickin to the man
with the money in his pocket flyin in his rocket
only stoppin by on his way to a better world

outro
if taylor finds a better world
then taylors gonna run away1embed"
