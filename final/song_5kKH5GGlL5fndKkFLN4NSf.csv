locked up they wont let me out
and i had a long day in court shit stress me out
wont give me a bail they cant get me out
now im heading to the county gotta do a bid here
i used to living luxurious i dont wanna live here
the walls is gray the clothes is orange
the phones is broke the food is garbage
lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
sps the same i still merk your manses
drug money to rap money work advances
niggas ran and told i shouldve merked to kansas
got popped for a murder attempt
knock me on dblock when i was burnin the hemp
had a brick in the stash
hope they dont take it to a further extent
locked up and they wont let me out
when i hit my cellblock niggas know the dread be out

verse 2 akon
im steady tryin to find a motive
why do what i do
the freedom aint getting no closer
no matter how far i go
my car is stolen no registration
the cops patrollin
and now they done stopped me
and i get locked up

verse 3 akon
heading up town to reup
back with a couple kis
the corner blocks on fire
undercovers dressed as fiends
making so much money
products moving fast
put away the stash
as i sold the last bag
fucked around and got locked up

chorus akon

my nigga im locked up they wont let me out
no they wont let me out
im locked up they wont let me out

verse 4 styles p
now that im locked up i rep two sets so
ima ryde or die and stay dblocked up
two toothbrushes up whoever want it with p
when i walk by nigga get up
‘cause im locked up they cant get me out
i smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
cant wait for the day when they let me out

verse 5 akon
‘cause visitation no longer comes by
it seems like they forgot about me
commissary is getting empty
my cellmates getting food without me
i cant wait to get out
and move forward with my life
got a family that loves me
and wants me to do right
but instead im here locked up

chorus akon
they wont let me out
they wont let me out
oh im locked up they wont let me out
no they wont let me out
my nigga im locked up they wont let me out
they wont let me out
im locked up they wont let me out
no they wont let me out

‘cause im locked up
