long days of wanting you here
living in fear
shedding a tear for you
long nights of pastyfaced moons
echo in rooms
filling with gloom for me

chorus
letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea

verse 2
now step into the light
girl know the fright
in all the world than you
theres nothing lovelier girl
in all the world
than making love to you

chorus
letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea
lately got to thinking that
how i wonâ€™t have you here with meyou might also likeembed"
