coming  from a place where gunshots wake you up out your sleep
trying  to make it global its niggas dying from local beef
crabs in a barrel its too much negative energy
you think small so you could never connect with me
the  majority of you are not who you pretend to be
and  scary theyre just as yellow as cheddar cheese
make a game plan its so many possibilities
no  time
to fall behind
with small minds
and that glock 9
i  kept mine
at all times
now im just fine
i sip wine
in sunshine
on the west coast
take boat rides
in low tides
did everything but sky dive
and rock climb
maybe soon ill schedule that with some white guys
ghostwriting verses now people heard me about time
write it then record it producing slaps from both sides
ill make my home in this game we call entertainment
drop a little ep for a down payment
growing up i never said that i want to be famous
that idea was abstract jackson pollock painting
louisiana nigga wildin out in california
made a solid game plan then i had to run it
setbacks and distractions i see em by the dozens
stay focused make connections bro and get your money
blew bags in my past i was just a youngn
now im making plays with the bucks like my nigga gannis
antetokounmpo
need my pockets on sumo
heart colder than juneau
but 24k like bruno
had a latina dallas who grew up in a group home
i could have been her chulo
but moneys número uno
help your family thats one of the major keys
never stingy with money since we were teens
because i know just how hard the struggle can be
i hate not being able to help when familys in need
my cousin had some offenses
they issued warrants to get him
he needed bread for defense just
stop him going to prison
my homie called me up tripping
he lost his job in the city
he needed money for rent and he
and checked his stash and its empty
check my past and im simply  r e a l
im not a gangsta but i handle all beef myself
just a hood nigga with that heat on my belt
squeeze triggers like sicarios in cartels
if youve never joined a gang then youre not a gangsta
most of you are not the characters that youre portraying
clout chasing for your music so the kids play it
if youre from the burbs be proud can we trade places
if your life was a book would you write changes
i would probably scribble out where there was time wasted
i know now that im bigger than my imagination
im from a place where very few do something amazing
i would have less fun and more inspiration
til me and jayz where on a first name basis
peace out is how i greet these haters
you dont like me im unbothered i dont need these haters
say you got it on lock had to teach these haters
im a mac cant control alt delete me haters
command option escape
force quit on these lames
who i am is the same
but my situation changed
who you are is a shame
and your situation came
out to be worst than what it was when you started the game
living for clout
didnt help anyone out
didnt invest any money
didnt buy your mom a house
catch em talking to producers trying to lower the amount
how are you cheap talk people with those diamonds in your mouth
getting strong eating beats like children taking a vitamin
even when i was little i always had some fight in me
ghostwriting hits now all of these rappers biting me
im not even on tender and all of these bitches swiping me
made a couple rappers greater and i did it quietly
living like a regular person out in society
haters want me gone the industry has its eye on me
im too busy winning for now and as far as i can see
im working on my temp now
trying not to flip out
cool until im pissed now
working all my sins out
grind i cant quit now
if im ever locked down
beat the case mistrial
never turn snitch now
never rat friends out
dont care how it sounds
right here in this town
seen a couple big clowns
flex what they did now
feds in the mix now
judge heard you spit now
aint talking shit now
rep louisiana like aap in harlem im
at the club and i party with
college girls in their dorms
and women working on jobs
with strippers thots and some models and
cougars with grown daughters and
i was swimming in all of em
showing off guns on instagram live
trying to make people think youre some kinda bad guy
call people out then you run from the damn fight
see em on the streets then wait for them to pass by
not concerned with rappers claiming theyre on
record sales and streams proving em wrong
drogon when im snappin on a song
flames hot enough to melt the iron throne
dinosaur im a mastodon
future king im a champion
spit a verse on a sample song
eat the track that im rapping on
new shovel i have it yo
bury niggas in catacombs
add a verse to youre favorite jawn
like a bonus ill add it on
half of you are clones
dont come at me wrong
ill expose you like insta thots with just panties on
then explode that little clout that youre standing on
call your ladys phone
now her things are gone
when you make it home
something like a divorce
you should have stayed on course
the rap game is yours
but i snuck indoors
like a trojan horse
in the trojan wars
i was chosen boy
but my achilles heal is just selling words i wrote before
nah let me elaborate more
my achilles heal was just not knowing im chosen boy
now i finally get it so my ambition is take whats yours
til my team is eating like we all live in a grocery store
you might also likenow i finally get it so my ambition is take whats yours
til my team is eating like we all live in a grocery store

think about whats on my mind before you step to me
you dont know whats in it like cheap molly and xtc
cookin beats with flames
these other rappers could never see
my plan to kill the game
call it my rest in peace
recipe shui

kali muscle
why you worried about what a motherfucka do
you know what im saying thats bitch shit
the bitch motherfuckas out there
yall know yall bitches
thats the cold part about itembed"
