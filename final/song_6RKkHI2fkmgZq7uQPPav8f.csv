she froze up when that ghost came ghost came
big body rolls it be hoggin up both lanes both lanes
she lift her nose up when she want that cocaine cocaine
i lift my doors up the lambo take propane propane
after my show we put hoes in the chokehold chokehold
at the door we take cell phones no photos
money comin in too much i cant hold truckload
im hot i cant be trappin in the streets that what the plug fo
and all i want is nachos nachos
and all i want is huncho huncho
pulls strings like a banjo banjo
and the keys a piano piano
take me back to the back door back door
i can see my foot on a doorknob
make it back to the gang thats the whole job
chop it up and talk about just what we got
whatcha got whatcha got whatcha got
