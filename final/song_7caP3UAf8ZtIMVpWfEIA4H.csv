chorus
i know these niggas never been a hundred they let that fame switch em
did all that preachin bout bein solid then you changed nigga
im from that 1300 block im still the same nigga
they know how i bleed swear this shit up in my veins nigga
i looked my brother in his eyes i seen the pain in em
boy i wont play ill go to war about my gang members
i was in the trenches slidin with them grave diggers
chopper showers he gon fall once that rain hit him

verse 1
addicted to this ecstasy i like how it feel
its like i been poppin x ever since i tried a pill
shit got me through some hard times i lost my mind for real
lot of shit happened way too fast i aint have time to heal
ed was gon make it on that court but he died in the field
i was still hangin in the hood before i signed a deal
posted on hudson jakes ridin past i had my nine concealed
hot nem do no talking they just spark shit when its time to drill
lil stank so reckless he ride fast when he behind the wheel
my shorties hot keep bending blocks they gon slide with the steel
we lost some soldiers in that war so they been tryin to kill
i be dolo with my ice on i been tryin to chill

verse 2
aint no playin both sides over here please make your mind up and choose
bitches cheerleadin and then they sneak dissin i think they sort of confused
please stop runnin your mouth thats how brothers go missin and niggas get put on the news
you goin through it you losin it huh my shorties eager to tighten your screws
them blickers go off like alarms but you aint wakin up if you snooze
niggas be clowns puttin on shows for the media i dont be shit but amused
i wont forget bout that lil shit you said we gon get you for frontin your move
my shootas some hellraisers come through clappin broad they dont give a fuck bout the rules
i played the block went on them drills by my lonely i had the fouroh up in school
fightin anxiety so i kept spendin my last on all of the drugs i abuse
down on my ass they aint give a fuck about me i felt like i aint have nothin to lose
now im in my bag just tryna run up these millis cause i aint got nothin to prove
