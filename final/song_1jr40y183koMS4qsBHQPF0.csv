didnt get the job cause she missed her appointment
she dont know if the kids are fed
theyve got holes in their shoes and the colds coming quick now
the powers off the bills aint paid
gotta jump the box for the neighbors apartment
space heaters and welfare checks are as good as it gets
in this land of hard lessons

dont talk to me if you aint got the answers that i need
yeah ive got problems cant you see im trying to solve them

broke it off with the man in her life
finally got the courage to pack up and leave now
she keeps saying shell be all right
but in her mind does she really believe it
long lines on piedmont street
but if you hang around you might get a bed there
turn around and dont look back
youve got a piece of your life so take it and run now

dont talk to me if you aint got the answers that i need
yeah ive got problems cant you see im trying to solve them

the sun is shining on you
maureen may all your dreams come true
see dropkick murphys liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebroke it off with the man in her life
you know she aint got nothing better
yeah you know she dont but she keeps on believing

the sun is shining on you
maureen may all your dreams come trueembed"
