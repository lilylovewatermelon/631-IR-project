well boy meets girl and it is a good bet
girls going to play a little hard to get
but they both got the same thing on their mind
is not that the way that the world goes round
do not it get you up get you down
it gets you walking around with a flashlight trying to find
love

chorus
ooh got to get you some got to get you some got to get you some
ooh got to get you some love

verse 2
then boy sees girl with another guy
what he would not give just to catch her eye because man
she is so hot
but you cannot compete with a superstar
he is got a big old house and little red car
and what need is the one thing you is not got money

chorus
ooh got to get you some got to get you some got to get you some
ooh got to get you some money
ooh got to get you some got to get you some got to get you some
ooh got to get you some yeah

then god smiles down from up above
the money rolls in and they fall in love
from the outside looking in it is a dream come true
but as time goes by something turns up missing
there is not enough hugging and not enough kissing
before too long they better do what they got to do you know

chorus
ooh got to get you some got to get you some got to get you some
ooh got to get you some babies
ooh got to get you some got to get you some got to get you some
ooh got to get you some yeah

verse 4
you know curtain climbers and rugrats and tricycle motors
it does not matter what you call them you got to have a whole house full of them
is not nothing in the world like youngins get you someembed"
