i got a friend
shows me all the good times
tells me i look better
chews me up and spits me out
and then walks my ass home
and sings a song
when im gone gone go on
that little friend
shoots me up and downtown
when i cant get me drunk enough
to pick me out the pieces
of a place i call home

chorus
to sing a song
until im gone gone go on
no
go on x3

verse 2
ive got a friend
helps me to get up again
showers me in boozes
tells me i got a big old dick
and she wants my ass home
