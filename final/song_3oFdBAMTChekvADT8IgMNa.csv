city life
calling me all the time
me and my soul
geared to attack
never get another chance
so what you doing
gotta get money
cant quite do it

hook 2d
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness

verse 2 2d
shit  night life
be trying not to laugh though
you wont get money
from doing what you loving
im moving out of city
victim of a second chance
get a lot of problems
we kicked a lot of them

cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness

hook 2d
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness
cant stand your loneliness no not the loneliness6embed"
