remember how we used to party up all night
sneakin out lookin for a taste of real life
drinkin in the small town firelight
pabst blue ribbon on ice
sweet sixteen and we had arrived
walkin down the streets as they whistle hi hi
stealin police cars with the senior guys
teachers said wed never make it out alive

prechorus
there she was my new best friend
high heels in her hand swayin in the wind
oh she starts to cry mascara runnin down her little bambi eyes
lana how i hate those guys

chorus
this is what makes us girls
we all look for heaven and we put love first
somethin that wed die for its a curse
dont cry about it dont cry about it
this is what makes us girls
we dont stick together cause we put love first
dont cry about him dont cry about him
its all gonna happen
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeverse 2
and thats where the beginning of the end begun
everybody knew that we had too much fun
we were skippin school and drinkin on the job with the boss
sweet sixteen and we had arrived
babys table dancin at the local dive
cheerin our names in the pink spotlight
drinkin cherry schnapps in the velvet night

prechorus
yo we used to go break into the hotel
glimmerin wed swim
runnin from the cops in our black bikini tops
screamin get us while were hot get us while were hot
cmon take a shot

chorus
this is what makes us girls
we all look for heaven and we put love first
somethin that wed die for its a curse
dont cry about it dont cry about it
this is what makes us girls
we dont stick together cause we put love first
dont cry about him dont cry about him
its all gonna happen
bridge
the prettiest incrowd that you had ever seen
ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
a freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
and you know somethin

verse 3
they were the only friends i ever had
we got into trouble and when stuff got bad
i got sent away i was wavin on the train platform
cryin cause i know im never comin back

chorus
this is what makes us girls
we all look for heaven and we put love first
somethin that wed die for its a curse
dont cry about it dont cry about it
this is what makes us girls
we dont stick together cause we put love first
dont cry about him dont cry about him
its all gonna happen oh101embed"
