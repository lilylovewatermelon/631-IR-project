hey dad look at me
think back and talk to me
did i grow up according to plan
and do you think im wasting my time
doing things i wanna do
but it hurts when you disapprove all along

prechorus
and now i try hard to make it
i just wanna make you proud
im never gonna be good enough for you
cant pretend that im alright
and you cant change me

chorus
cause we lost it all
nothing lasts forever
im sorry
i cant be perfect
now its just too late
and we cant go back
im sorry
i cant be perfect

verse 2
i try not to think
about the pain i feel inside
did you know you used to be my hero
all the days you spent with me
now seem so far away
and it feels like you dont care anymore
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeprechorus
and now i try hard to make it
i just wanna make you proud
im never gonna be good enough for you
i cant stand another fight
and nothings alright

chorus
cause we lost it all
nothing lasts forever
im sorry
i cant be perfect
now its just too late
and we cant go back
im sorry
i cant be perfect

bridge
nothings gonna change the things that you said
and nothings gonna make this right again right again
please dont turn your back
i cant believe its hard just to talk to you
but you dont understand you dont understand

chorus
cause we lost it all
nothing lasts forever
im sorry
i cant be perfect
now its just too late
and we cant go back
im sorry
i cant be perfect
cause we lost it all
nothing lasts forever
im sorry
i cant be perfect
now its just too late
and we cant go back
im sorry
i cant be perfect20embed"
