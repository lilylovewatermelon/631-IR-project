i walk past the bleak halls of an architects unimagination
returning to the venue where we held that very first conversation
to see you again to be your friend to hold you in my mind

and i arrived there early and as always you swanned in much later
as if nothing had ever changed you nod at me and order your double and mixer
to see you again to be your friend to hold you in my mind

were laughing and were joking like we always always used to
too rudely interrupted by your halfwit of a boyfriend who tries to call you
to see you again to be your friend to hold you in his mind
