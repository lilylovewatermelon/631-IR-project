hey baby
i wish you could see what i have on right now
you so sexy
imagine how intense it would be
to hold me right now
our songs playin

verse 1 beyoncé  kelly rowland
at night when youre far and im alone
i feel the fabric from your tshirt flow with my body
i can still hear your baritone in my ear
tellin me youll take it slow
and i was in the mirror playin roles
like you were here i couldnt turn me on
so i fell asleep with the music on
woke up again hearin the same old song playin oh

prechorus kelly rowland
give it to me deeper oh
givin me the fever oh
now you got my feet up this one is a keeper
now the second verse is playin oh
oh we tried to stand up oh
hold me while my hands up oh
and the music kicks off fantasies were shook up
im thinkin to myself again
