deep inside of everyone
theres a hot ball of shame
guilt regret anxiety
fears we dare not name
but if we show the ugly parts
that we hide away
they turn out to be beautiful
by the light of day
 
why not

who wants to share whats in their heart
no volunteers fine ill start
my names pauline
i live alone
my husband left
my kids are grown
in the 60s love was free
that did not work out well for me
the revolution came and went
tried to change the world
barely made a dent
i have struggled with despair
ive joined a cult
chopped off my hair
i chant i prayed but gods not there
so steve im ending our affair
and i faked it every single time
woo that feels fanfreakingtastic
1 2 take me home kids
