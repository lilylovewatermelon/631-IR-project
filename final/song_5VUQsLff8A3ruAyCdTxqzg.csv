who am i that the lord of all the earth
would care to know my name
would care to feel my hurt
who am i that the bright and morning star
would choose to light the way
for my ever wandering heart

prechorus
not because of who i am
but because of what youve done
not because of what ive done
but because of who you are

chorus
i am a flower quickly fading
here today and gone tomorrow
a wave tossed in the ocean
a vapor in the wind
still you hear me when im calling
lord you catch me when im falling
and youve told me who i am
i am yours i am yours

verse 2
who am i that the eyes that see my sin
would look on me with love and watch me rise again
who am i that the voice that calmed the sea
would call out through the rain
and calm the storm in me
