i think ive walked too close to love
and now im falling in
theres so many things this weary soul cant take
maybe you just caught me by surprise
the first time that i looked into your eyes

chorus
theres a life inside of me that i can feel again
its the only thing that takes me where ive never been
i dont care if i lost everything that i have known
it dont matter where i lay my head tonight
your arms feel like home
feel like home

verse 2
this life aint the fairytale we both thought it would be
but i can see your smiling face as its staring back at me
i know we both see these changes now
i know we both understand somehow

chorus
theres a life inside of me that i can feel again
its the only thing that takes me where ive never been
i dont care if i lost everything that i have known
it dont matter where i lay my head tonight
your arms feel like home
feel like home
theres a life inside of me that i can feel again
its the only thing that takes me where ive never been
i dont care if i lost everything that i have known
it dont matter where i lay my head tonight
your arms feel like home
feel like homeyou might also likeembed"
