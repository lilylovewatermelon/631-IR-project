aggressively we all defend the role we play
regrettably times come to send you on your way
weve seen it all bonfires of trust flash floods of pain

prechorus
it doesnt really matter dont you worry itll all work out
no it doesnt even matter dont you worry that aint what its all about

chorus
we hope you enjoyed your stay
its good to have you with us
even if its just for the day
we hope you enjoyed your stay
outside the sun is shinin
seems like heaven aint far away
its good to have you with us
even if its just for the day

piano solo

outro
its good to have you with us
even if its just for the day
outside the sun is shinin
seems like heaven aint far away
its good to have you with us
even if its just for the day
outside the sun is shinin
seems like heaven aint far awaysee the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like11embed"
