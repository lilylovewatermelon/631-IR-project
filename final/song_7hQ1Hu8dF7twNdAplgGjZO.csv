backseat of your family station wagon
listening nina simone
100 years of solitude
and only 12 years old

chorus
god make up your mind
god make up your mind
do you wanna play fair
or should i take whats mine

verse 1
your mom is calling out look at the grand canyon
camilla couldnt care less
gaze into the hole
your stomach feels the emptiness of death

chorus
god make up your mind
god make up your mind
do you wanna play fair
or should i take whats mine
like everyone else

bridge
from new york to new orleans played alphabet
kansas to boise won the battleship
memorized the capitals crossword puzzles
drew a picture of a cat laying dead in the street
daydream about my real dad back in california
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeverse 2
elephant in your brain
reminding you youve got to make a choice
wraps his arms around you slow
cause you tense up like an armadillo

chorus
god make up your mind
god make up your mind
do you wanna play fair
or should i take whats mine
like everyone else

outro
why aint my teacher on a street sign
hes done so much more than politicians dead musicians
you wanna help someone you gotta be a no one
thats what i figured out the cat in the street meant
you gotta make up your mind
make up your mind
make up your mindembed"
