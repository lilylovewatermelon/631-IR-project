i was scared but once i thought about i let it go
everything she said to me i guess i ought to know
were all tired talk when it comes to shove
put up put out or stay at home

chorus
well never be the same never feel this way again
id give you anything but you want pain
a little water please i taste you all over my teeth
never again just tonight okay

verse 2
all at once the music stopped the feeling went away
an ugly picture me and you but nothing i can change
you know what happens with the lights back on
the less you know the more you want
you want you want

chorus
well never be the same never feel this way again
id give you anything but you want pain
a little water please i taste you all over my teeth
never again just tonight okay

well never be the same never feel this way again
id give you anything but you want pain
a little water please i taste you all over my teeth
never again just tonight okay
