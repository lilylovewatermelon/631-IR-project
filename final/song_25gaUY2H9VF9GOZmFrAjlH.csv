pour me pour me pour me another
it holds me holds me like no other
one more drink then i swear that im going home
truth is i dont really have a place to go
so pour me pour me pour me another
verse 1 johnny 3 tears
i wake up right about the midafternoon
with the sun in the sky but nights coming soon
and i walk to the mirror just to fix myself
yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else
so i pick up my pills from the counter drawer
pick my selfesteem up off the fucking floor
i guess im a man of no recourse
as i crack another bottle got no remorse
and ill say a little prayer for the child in me
i swear i used to be one i truly believed
that im not just a man with these broken dreams
that even i can go to heaven if i part the sea so

chorus danny
pour me pour me pour me another
it holds me holds me like no other
one more drink then i swear that im going home
truth is i dont really have a place to go
so pour me pour me pour me another

people get sick and theyll watch you bleed
when you fall from the top boy you better believe
at the bottom they got just yeah just what you need
but at the bottom you cant swim cause you drank up the sea
when we stop and we look up to the sky
they dont ask any questions they ask us why
dont have any answers dont know what to say
our knees are getting tired too tired to pray
thats when we lay down end of the road
we all seem to walk it guess i walked it alone
and im not just a man with these broken dreams
even i can go to heaven if i part the sea so…

chorus danny
pour me pour me pour me another
it holds me holds me like no other
one more drink then i swear that im going home
truth is i dont really have a place to go
so pour me pour me pour me another

bridge danny  johnny 3 tears
time just seems to go on and on
on and on and on and on
life inside a bottle all along
all along the bottles gone
im not just a man with these broken dreams
even i can go to heaven if i part the sea
whats life inside a bottle if its gone
one more song and im finally free
ill meet you here in heaven between the sea
cause im not just a man with these broken dreams
even i can go to heaven if i part the sea so…
chorus danny
pour me pour me pour me another
it holds me holds me like no other
one more drink then i swear that im going home
truth is i dont really have a place to go
so pour me pour me pour me another
