called down the stairs of your mothers house
sydney’s sittin on the couch
whats she going on about
i don’t even care
if you were making out
i guess you worked it out
worked it out

chorus
and then it started to snow
i didnt think about it when i gave you my coat
i didnt think about it when i wrote you that note
i guess therere some things that you shouldnt know
but ill tell you anyway
and you can tell me bout it if youve had a bad day
i’ll teach you how to laugh if you can teach me crochet
why go to class if we’re already late
