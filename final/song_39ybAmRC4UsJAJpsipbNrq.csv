ive been all pinched up since saturday
ive run myself dry of excellence
sixteen long years inhale theâ€” in
whatever i said on saturday
whatever i did id do it all again
nineteen marks up walls each year one short fall

chorus
tiny voices make things harder
everybody will be let down
everybody will be let down

verse 2
what is this for ex parking lot
the dreamers go by they never stop
twenty plus five in let the youth cave in

chorus
tiny voices make things harder
everybody will be let down
everybody will be let down

use your voices
use your voices

everybody will be let down
everybody will be let down
everybody will be let down
everybody will be let down1embed"
