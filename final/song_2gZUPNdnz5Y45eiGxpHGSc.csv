intro kanye west
im living in that 21st century doing something mean to it
do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
i guess every superhero need his theme music

chorus kanye west
no one man should have all that power
the clock’s ticking i just count the hours
stop tripping im tripping off the power
21stcentury schizoid man

verse 1 kanye west
the system broken the schools closed the prisons open
we aint got nothing to lose motherfucker we rolling
huh motherfucker we rolling
with some lightskinned girls and some kelly rowlands
in this white man world we the ones chosen
so goodnight cruel world ill see you in the morning
huh ill see you in the morning
this is way too much i need a moment

chorus kanye west
no one man should have all that power
the clocks ticking i just count the hours
stop tripping im tripping off the power
til then fuck that the worlds ours
and they say and they say
and they say and they say
and they say and they say
21stcentury schizoid man

fuck snl and the whole cast
tell them yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
more specifically they can kiss my asshole
im an asshole you niggas got jokes
you shortminded niggas thoughts is napoleon
my furs is mongolian my ice brought the goalies in
i embody every characteristic of the egotistic
he knows hes so fuckin gifted
i just needed time alone with my own thoughts
got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
my childlike creativity purity and honesty
is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
reality is catching up with me
taking my inner child im fighting for custody
with these responsibilities that they entrusted me
as i look down at my diamondencrusted piece

chorus kanye west
thinking no one man should have all that power
the clocks ticking i just count the hours
stop tripping im tripping off the powder
til then fuck that the world’s ours
and they say and they say
and they say and they say
and they say and they say
21stcentury schizoid man
verse 3 kanye west
colin powells austin powers
lost in translation with a whole fuckin nation
they say i was the abomination of obamas nation

jumping out the window letting everything go
letting everything go
