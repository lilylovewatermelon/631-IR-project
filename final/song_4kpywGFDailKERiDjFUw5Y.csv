tell me exactly what am i supposed to do
now that i have allowed you to beat me
do you think that we could play another game
maybe i could win this time
i kind of like the misery you put me through
darling you can trust me completely
if you even try to look the other way
i think that i could kill this time

refrain
rah rah
rah rah

verse 1
it doesnt really seem im getting through to you
though i see you weeping so sweetly
i think that you might have to take another taste
a little bit of hell this time

prechorus
rah rah lie to me
rah rah lie to me

chorus
is she not right
is she insane
will she now
run for her life in the battle that ends this day
is she not right
is she insane
will she now
run for her life now that she lied to me

you always wanted people to remember you
to leave your little mark on society
well dont you know your wish is coming true today
another victim dies tonight

prechorus
rah rah lie to me
rah rah lie to me

chorus
is she not right
is she insane
will she now
run for her life in the battle that ends this day
is she not right
is she insane
will she now
run for her life now that she lied to me

telling lies again
doesnt she realize

chorus
is she not right
is she insane
will she now
run for her life in the battle that ends this day

is she insane
will she now
run for her life now that she lied to me

outro
the little bitch she went and she told a lie
and now she will never tell another a lie
the little bitch she went and she told a lie
never fucking lie to me2embed"
