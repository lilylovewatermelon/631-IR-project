i got a certain little girl shes on my mind
no doubt about it she looks so fine
shes the best girl that i ever had
sometimes shes gonna make me feel so bad

na nanana nanana nanana

hush hush
i thought i heard her calling my name now
hush hush
she broke my heart but i love her just the same now
hush hush
thought i heard her calling my name now
hush hush
i need her loving and im not to blame now

love love
they got it early in the morning
love love
they got it late in the evening
love love
well i want that need it
love love
oh i gotta gotta have it
you might also likeshes got loving like quicksand
only took one touch of her hand
to blow my mind and im in so deep
that i cant eat and i cant sleep

hush hush
she broke my heart but i love her just the same now
