my colors they change with the sun
my branches were higher than anything on the hillside
on the day that i watched them all come
some were the color of the sky in the winter
some were as blue as the night
they came like a storm with the light of the morn
and they fell thru the whole day and night

colors flew high and they danced in the sky
as i watched them come over the hill
then to my wonder sticks that made thunder
such a great number lay still

when the light came again there was death on the wind
as the buzzards made way for the worms
and the little white trees that dont bend in the breeze
for the ones that will never return

the colors flew high and they danced in the sky
as i watched them come over the hill
then to my wonder sticks that made thunder
such a great number lay still

those that have fallen they come when i call them
and answer the best that they can
but all they can see is what they used to be
and thats all that they understand
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likethe colors flew high and they danced in the sky
as i watched them come over the hill
then to my wonder sticks that made thunder
such a great number lay still

colors flew high and they danced in the sky
as i watched them come over the hill
then to my wonder sticks that made thunderembed"
