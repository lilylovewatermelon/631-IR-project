ive got twodozen roses
and a card that says baby i cant wait to see you later

having a damn good time i know whats on your mind
i want you you want me too
stop fronting i know exactly what you want you wanna

chorus
do it to me i wanna feel you touch my body baby body baby
do it to me i guarantee you wont regret it
let me set it out like you aint never had it
do it to me i want you to grab me talk to me
tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it
do it to me im gonna give it to you
im gonna make this a night to remember

verse 2
watching you work the stick in the ride
the motion how you move from 3rd to 5
cant imagine what it’s gon be once we get inside
and you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
ooh i cant wait
im tired of thinking about it speaking about it
baby its time to be about it
turn off the lights tear off your clothes
jump in the bed and let it flow
squeezing holding biting scratching spanking screaming
pulling my hair when you need me
everything goes baby when you

do it to me i wanna feel you touch my body baby body baby

bridge
so long ive waited for this night to get inside you
look in your eyes and tell you baby take me im yours
and if you feel anything like i feel
by the end of the night im certain youll be screaming for more
i wanna do anything and everything to your body
til you break down cant take no more
from the bed to the floor to the top of the stairs
you gon get it baby
please please oh… do it to me

chorus
do it to me i wanna feel you touch my body baby body baby
do it to me i guarantee you wont regret it
let me set it out like you aint never had it

tell me how you like it when you want it when you all up on it
do it to me im gonna give it to you
im gonna make this a night to rememberembed"
