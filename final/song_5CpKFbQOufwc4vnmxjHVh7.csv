cause im really feeling down
and if youre feeling lonesome too
id like it if you came around
do you miss what you thought you were
back when you thought you knew what you are
do you miss your favorite song
back when you thought you knew what was wrong
where you are
i dont care i just wanna be a part
of something
when i was sixteen i was dead
i was sick from being underfed
when i was twelve all i did was cry
i saw my favorite band burn alive
when i was ten i hated you cause you hurt me
it was what you knew
do you miss me stephanie
cause im really missing you
where you are
i dont care i just want to be a part of somethingyou might also like2embed"
