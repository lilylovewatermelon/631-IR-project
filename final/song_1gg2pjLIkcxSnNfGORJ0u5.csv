youre dead
youre dead

verse 1
your bodys cold
hope is lost i cant let go
can i die with you so we can never grow old
cut the ties cut the ties
with this note you left behind
as i read the words i hear you telling me why

chorus
too late too late
i never said goodbye
too late too late
cant even ask you why
and now im wasting away in my own misery
i hope youve finally gone to a place where you belong

verse 2
my sadness shows
as your name is carved in stone
cant erase the words so the reality grows
i wish i died i wish i died
on that night right by your side night right by your side
so just kill me now and let the good times roll
