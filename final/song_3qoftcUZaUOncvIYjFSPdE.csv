baby love i think ive been a little too kind
didnt notice you walkin all over my peace of mind
in the shoes i gave you as a present
puttin someone first only works when youre in their top five
and by the way im goin out tonight

chorus
best believe im still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask do you have a man
i could still say i dont remember
familiarity breeds contempt
dont put mе in the basement
whеn i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real i polish up real nice

postchorus
nice

verse 2
baby boy i think ive been too good of a girl too good of a girl
did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
i think its time to teach some lessons
i made you my world huh have you heard huh
i can reclaim the land
and i miss you miss you but i miss sparklin nice

when i want the penthouse of your heart

bridge
sapphire tears on my face
sadness became my whole sky
but some guy said my auras moonstone
just cause he was high
and were dancin all night
and you can try to change my mind
but you might have to wait in line
whats a girl gonna do
a diamonds gotta shine
chorus
best believe im still bejeweled

i can still make the whole place shimmer shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask do you have a man
i could still say i dont remember
familiarity breeds contempt
dont put me in the basement
when i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real nice i polish up real nice

outro
and were dancin all night
and you can try to change my mind
but you might have to wait in line
whats a girl gonna do whats a girl gonna do
