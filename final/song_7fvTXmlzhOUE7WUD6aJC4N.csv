heres the deal
’cause i know you wanna talk about it
heres the deal
i promise you like a million tomorrows
heres the deal
what i can promise is i’ll lie down
like a bed of wildflowers
and ill always make the sheets
smell like gardenias wild at your feet
and i nourish you hazily

prechorus
baby i i i ive been runnin on stardust
alone for so long
i wouldnt know what hot fire was
hot fire hot weather hot coffee
im better with you
its strange but its true darling

chorus
not to turn into a wildfire
to light up your night
with only my smile and nothing that burns
baby i’ll be like a wildflower
i live on sheer willpower
i’ll do my best never to turn into something
that burns burns burns
like the others baby burns burns burns

heres the deal
’cause i know you wanna talk about it
heres the deal
you say theres gaps to fill in so here
heres the deal
my father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
so i ended up awkward but sweet
later then hospitals stand still on my feet
comfortably numb but with lithium came poetry

prechorus
and baby i i’ve been running on star drip
ivs for so long
i wouldnt know how cruel the world was
hot fire hot weather hot coffee im better
so i turn but i learn it from you babe

chorus
not to turn into a wildfire
to light up your night
with only my smile and nothing that hurts
baby i run like a wildflower
i live on sheer willpower
i promise that nothing will burn you
nothing will burn burn burn
like the others baby burns burns burns
burn burn burn like the others baby
like the others baby burns burns burns
outro
its you from whom i learn learn learn
its you from whom i learn learn learn49embed"
