the lights from above seemed to shine on only you
and you made me feel like i was flying
when i made you sparkle in your eyes
we aint even 20 baby
i aint learned to love you right yeah
umm good thing i thought i was the shit back then
i sang in your ear cause i wanted you to know
that i had soul baby
i called you all the time
i guess i tried too hard to make you mine
youd have nothing to do with me baby
thank god that you changed oh

for the rest of my life you know im gonna be yours
for the rest of my life you know i wanna be yours
for the rest of my life for you im gonna be strong
baby will you stay
baby will you stay
baby will you stay
baby will you stay mine

finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
i said forever my lady and kissed you for the very first time
after months holidays holding hands in the park
normally id just play basketball or something in the park
and i messed up like boys tend to do
itd be a year till i got back with you
thank god that you called me back baby
cause id never be the man that i am today

for you im gonna be strong
baby will you stay

then one night upon the phone
you said you were at home alone
i wasnt even old enough to drive
i saw my only chance just to keep it alive
keep love alive
good thing for you i stole my daddys car
cause no ones gonna ever love you better
better than i do yes i do

for the rest of my life you know im gonna be yours
