inside inside inside inside
inside inside inside inside

verse 1 corey taylor
giving in to what has got me
bleeding claustrophobic scarred
severed me from all emotion
life is just too fucking hard
snap your face was all it took
cause this need aint doin me no good
fall on my face but cant you see
this fucking life is killing me

prechorus corey taylor  clown
tearing me inside
tearing me inside
tearing me inside
tearing me inside

verse 2 corey taylor
too far gone im catatonic
leaving you to criticize
empty shell and running naked
all alone lobotomized
back and forth between my hangups
it isnt easy to be hated
where do ya go what do ya do
simpleton impromptu
crazy eight i never cared
not once gotta get away
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeprechorus corey taylor  clown
tearing me inside
tearing me inside
tearing me inside
tearing me inside

chorus corey taylor
i wasnt promised a thing
you keep mocking me
but you will never again
before you know it after youre gone

bridge corey taylor  clown
youre gone youre gone
somos feos y apestamos pero reinamos joto motherfucker
youre gone youre gone

chorus corey taylor
i wasnt promised a thing
you keep mocking me
but you will never again
before you know it after youre gone

outro corey taylor
gone gone gone
