when i walk in the kitchen my heart hits the floor
cause its you that im missin
i still see a vision of us cookin dinner
and you holding me from behind from behind
and you say please be careful the knife is so big
and we cant have another er trip
were too young too dumb
too in love to afford it to afford it

prechorus
and now its just me
and a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
deleted the playlist but i still hear all your favorite melodies
strangers to lovers to enemies

chorus
so ill dance with your ghost in thе living room
and ill play the piano alone
but im too scared to dеlete all our videos
cause its real once everyone knows
couldve at least shown me some decency
done me a favor and packed up your clothes
fallin in love no it aint for the weak
so dont try this at home

the couch that we sat on back in new york
has made its way three thousand miles to la
these pillows been talkin
askin me where the hell youve been where the hell youve been
told me you loved me two weeks in
and i knew i would fall for you over and over
but who wouldve known that
the fallin would come to an end come to an end

prechorus
but now its just me
and a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
deleted the playlist but i still hear all your favorite melodies
strangers to lovers to enemies

chorus
so ill dance with your ghost in the living room
and ill play the piano alone
but im too scared to delete all our videos
cause its real once everyone knows
you couldve at least shown me some decency
done me a favor and packed up your clothes
falling in love no it aint for the weak
so dont try this at home
