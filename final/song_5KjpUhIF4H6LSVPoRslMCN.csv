i made promises that i cant keep
i fell asleep
i was the one who locked the door
i lost the key
told me lies straight to my face
but i guess thats fate

verse ned russin
i said everything is fine with me
i lied through my teeth
i lost all of my selfrespect
its such a wreck
im running out of air to breathe
think its time for me to

bridge ned russin
leave my friends
all behind
watch me hurt
or are you blind
i think its sad
youll never know
my true feelings
will never show

i made promises that i cant keep
i fell asleep
i was the one who locked the door
i lost the key
told me lies straight to my face
but i guess thats fate

outro ned russin
ill be you and youll be me
ill be you and youll be me
my secret society
ill be you and youll be me
ill be you and youll be me
