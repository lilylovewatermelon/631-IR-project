like it was yesterday
the time would never end
and my friends were family
nothing mattered more
than the loyalty we had
now im a world away from everything we shared

i had something better
waiting ahead
i try to take control of my heart
i had something better
but ill tear it down and ill tape it up
by my own design i fall

bring back the days
three story parking lot
the air is never dry
as the city falls asleep days bleed into the night
the tables set the stage
for a life of memories
but im a world away from everything

i had something better
waiting ahead
i try to take control of my heart
i had something better
but ill tear it down and ill tape it up
by my own design i fall
you might also likeapart as time passes by
i fall apart but the memories never die
and i still recall every summer night
it seems like yesterday but im still a world away

i had something better
waiting ahead
i try to take control of my heart
i had something better
but ill tear it down and ill tape it up
by my own design i fallembed"
