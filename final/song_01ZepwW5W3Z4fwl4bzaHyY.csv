verse 1
welcome to the home of the hillbilly
yeah baby
its a land of barbed wire and moonshine whiskey
park your car before you get it stuck
go on grab you a beer
and get on up in the truck
its going down tonight
its all on me
its byob and i got all we need
yeah boy im bout to show me a city slicker
how to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on

chorus
our side of the barbed wire
money grows in rows
if it dont youre going broke
so we
we hang out by the bonfire
just some good all boys having a dang good time
we crank it up down here
we get loud down here
throwing down in the dirty dirty south down here
be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
jocks and bikers they all came to kick it in the sticks
see brantley gilbert liveget tickets as low as 38you might also likeverse 2
so pop a top and drop a tailgate
yeah were cranking up acdc hank skynyrd and george strait
wheres the girls
bout to call em up
a little southern drawl said hey trouble whats up
its going down tonight
now theyre pulling up
we got the jacked up trucks slap covered in mud
bikini tops and daisy duke denim
hopping out singing outlaw women down on

chorus
our side of the barbed wire
money grows in rows
if it dont youre going broke
so we
we hang out by the bonfire
just some good all boys having a dang good time
we crank it up down here
we get loud down here
throwing down in the dirty dirty south down here
be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
jocks and bikers they all came to kick it in the sticks

verse 3
hey boy hit this mason jar one time
burned you a little bit didnt it
ever been snipe hunting
come on
well do a little frog gigging cow tipping
how bout a little skinny dipping bass fishing
take it easy on the shine
and stay away from other boys women
thats one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
these boys are tough down here
get your ass tore up down here
and be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
jocks and bikers they all came
chorus
our side of the barbed wire
money grows in rows
if it dont youre going broke
so we
we hang out by the bonfire
just some good all boys having a dang good time
we crank it up down here
we get loud down here
throwing down in the dirty dirty south down here
be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
jocks and bikers they all came to kick it in the sticks5embed"
