it was a perfect day for the end of may they say a record high
i was starin at that green water
when out of the blue and by surprise
she had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
she grabbed a beer said im out of here
and walked out of my life

chorus
that was a cold one i never will get back
if she had to leave
did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack
she left me hanging high and dry in that
hell hot summer sun
damn babe that was a cold one

verse 2
it aint the first time or last time i watched love walk out
but its damn sure the one time i still aint forgot about
i still like to drink a beer but a long neck i wont do
cause every time i see one sweating man
i break out in one too

chorus
that was a cold one i never will get back
if she had to leave
did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack
she left me hanging high and dry in that
hell hot summer sun
damn babe that was a cold one

that was a cold one i never will get back
if she had to leave
did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack
she left me hanging high and dry in that hell hot summer sun
damn babe that was a cold one
damn babe that was a cold one4embed"
