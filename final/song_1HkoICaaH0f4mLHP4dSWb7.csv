i’m sick and tired of being so sick and tired
comin’ home from tour you yelling before i get through the door
with that so and so said this and that
why you still with me for
goin’ through my phone i made you feel like a fool
screaming who the fuck is alex
when alexander’s my dude
sometimes i think you do it simply cause you’re bored
if you really loved me we’d be making love not war
but you’d rather waste the little time we do have
going back and forth
are you sorry now well too bad
i can’t believe i wasted all this fucking time
instead of fighting with you i could have been writing rhymes or
hanging out with stitch and watchin’ up or something

you never tried to meet me halfway
you played these little immature ass gaayaymes
i tried to be the best man i can but you were too dumb to understand
that i can have any girl but i stayed with you
i guess everybody plays the foooohool and
now you think you’re coming back to me
but that’s something that i just don’t see

i thought this was forever the thought of leaving you never
but you gotta kick rocks cause your screaming’s leaving my head hurt
before you go there’s something that you should know
i’m taking everything i bought and you better leave me my red shirt
don’t even think of twisting this to make it my fault
or try to tell me you forgot to take your midol
cause you ain’t blaming this one on your period
and you can save the song and dance cause i’m gone period
huh what wait nope i’m not hearing it
the crash dummy final grabbed the wheel and now he’s steering it
oh dear god… what a disaster
and i probably shoulda done something faster
wait you know what you can kiss my ass
you’ve been dropped from the label and i’m keepin’ your masters
travie you’re a bastard
call me what you want to
whatever makes you feel better i don’t want you
ps i froze all your accounts and uh… leave that ring on the counter
