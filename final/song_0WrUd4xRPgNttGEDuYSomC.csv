outro lil keke the don
htown legend lil keke the don checkin in
see first off top ima say this man
it take a special motherfucker to even represent this way of life you understand
see this a culture where the trapstar and the rapstar got the same bag man
see the hustlers and the grinders they just as famous as the athletes and the movie stars see thats real talk
the way you walk the way you talk the way you carry yourself
gon tell me exactly where you from thats legend talk man
it aint about the car its about how the car make me feel
the way i tote it the statement that its gon make in the culture
cause it aint no vinyl in the car its leather all the way through
perforated from the guts to the door pannels to the booth
we dont ride raincoat
if i got the top up on it that motherfucker cover with the rain
doublestitched daytona carpet ten coats of clear on that paint
bitch thicker than megan get it
see thats how you talk slayer
have you ever seen a bitch so bad a nigga spend his last on that shit
big titties flat stomachs fat asses welcome to the culture nigga
slabs bikes muscle cars bentleys benzes
if im in it i own it
come from nothin paper plates to paper plates
mixtapes fried chicken double cups squares everywhere
ke what you sayin
i say it all to say how you like me now niggaembed"
