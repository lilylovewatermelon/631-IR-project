another mission the powers have called me away
another time to carry the colors again
my motivation an oath ive sworn to defend
to win the honor of coming back home again
no explanation will matter after we begin
unlock the dark destroyer thats buried within
my true vocation and now my unfortunate friend
you will discover a war youre unable to win

prechorus
ill have you know that ive become

chorus
indestructible
determination that is incorruptible
from the other side a terror to behold
annihilation will be unavoidable
every broken enemy will know
that their opponent had to be invincible
take a last look around while youre alive
im an indestructible master of war

verse 2
another reason another cause for me to fight
another fuse uncovered now for me to light
my dedication to all that ive sworn to protect
i carry out my orders without a regret
my declaration embedded deep under the skin
a permanent reminder of how it began
no hesitation when i am commanded to strike
you need to know that youre in for the fight of your life

you will be shown how ive become

chorus
indestructible
determination that is incorruptible
