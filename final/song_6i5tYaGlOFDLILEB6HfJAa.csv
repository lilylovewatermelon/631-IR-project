i dont have to leave anymore
what i have is right here
spend my nights and days before
searching the world for whats right here
underneath and unexplored
islands and cities i have looked
here i saw
something i couldnt overlook

chorus romy  both
i am yours now
so now i dont ever have to leave
ive been found now
so now ill never explore
see what ive done

verse 2 oliver  both
that bridge is on fire
back to where ive been
im froze by desire
no need to leave
where would i be
if this were to go under
thats a risk id take
im froze by desire
as if a choice id make
