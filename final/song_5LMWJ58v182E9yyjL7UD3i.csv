what am i supposed to do now

verse 1
reveal to me this ugly thing
im rusted metal by your head
its gotten out of hand again
nobody sees it but i can

prechorus
you thought of everything i bet
but did you think that i might die
i havent really smiled in
i dont know how long you know
somethings gonna give again
somethings gonna give again

chorus
i tried to fight but did you listen
even after youre gone man im never finished
i can never be your god
but then i dont even think i want the job anymore

verse 2
say something anything to me
i do believe but i have doubts
so many reasons to hold on
conflicting interest isnt it
you might also likeprechorus
i guess im better off in the end
cause you were always there to blame
i havent felt so bad in
i dont know how long you know
i cant get away again
i cant get away again

chorus
i tried to fight but did you listen
even after youre gone man im never finished
i can never be your god
but then i dont even think i want the job you see
i tried to fight but did you listen
even after youre gone man im never finished
i can never be your god
but then i dont even think i want the job anymore
