• ladies with two versions  one unrated  the video caused such a fury it was almost bigger than the song itself as was that one brunette the nudity itself wasnt really a problem per se so much as it was shocking to many people i mean really

• lyrics there was much debate about whether the lyrics were suggestive of rapejust let me liberate you
you dont need no papers
that man is not your maker
and thats why im gon take a good girlmany thought that regardless of the risqué video these references inappropriately targeted women other lyrics were found to be antifeminine in their nature and this caused feminist groups to go into an outrage thickes denied these claims

• lawsuit during an interview thicke talked about how he had a certain marvin gaye song in his head when making the song it ended up that he actually sampled marvin gaye as well the sample was from the 1977 song got to give it up there was a lawsuit later filed by gaye associates for the use of that sample2 controlthis was big seans song and he had a nice verse jay electronica went in as well then somewhere in between those two verses we got king kendrick lamar and nothing was the same if you wanna see someone throw bars on bars and dismantle everybody in the game while doing it look no further not only did he blow up twitter and every other platform many rappers were compelled to respond above all he shook up the industry and spiced up the hip hop game quite a bit no more light verses allowed but what made this song so talked about was

• names kendrick managed to piss off everybody in the rap game while only just recently making a name for himself he dropped a straight grimy verse that hasnt been spit in quite some time no one really tries to call out people anymore especially by name id probably be a little salty if i was jermaine cole big krit wale pusha t meek millz aap rocky drake big sean jay electron tyler or mac miller

• new york he also claimed he was the king of new york and that didnt make any rappers happy new york rappers like papoose and joey bada took this with special offense new york hasnt seemed to have held much of a grudge though especially as its rappers struggle to find its current influence in hip hop still i mean fuck it he technically didnt even claim just that he said he was 2pac and the notorious big every rapper tried to respond to kendrick through a track combined so what was his response to it alleverybody else gotta try harder though3 radioactivethe biggest song off of their album night visions this song was highly talked about because

• teens radioactive has been a hit on the radio and an anthem for many young teens and when you make an adolescent anthem it means a cultlike following this hit has propelled the band into the national spotlight many have been inspired by its message as the band speaks on its meaningradioactive to me its very masculine powerfulsounding song and the lyrics behind it theres a lot of personal story behind it but generally speaking its a song about having an awakening kind of waking up one day and deciding to do something new and see life in a fresh way• tv the single has also been used in various commercials as well which only furthered the popularity it gained and helped get it across different audiences on multiple platforms as the band continues to grow these tv spots helped people attract them to the album as a whole and boosted sale numbers and fan count4 royalsthis song put young songstress lorde into the music spotlight not only throughout the uk but around the globe the beat incorporates many different genres which helped this track reach multiple audiences the hook makes the song but what really made it so talked about was

• raw its powerful sound drives this song home the soothing voice made it such a good listen and its nonexplicit content meant it could be played anywhere and so it was played everywhere this helped the song garner massive radio play as well as on tv and by youth everywhere this song propelled her fanbase to a new level

• racist some peoples thoughts on the potentially racist aspects of the track have made this song talked about since its release some feel as if she took shots at some black superstars or even rappers in particular but she refused to comment a smart move by a young woman to avoid it all together5 rap godohh the return of em this song was highly talked about because

• disappointment after 3 years of silence since recoverys release eminem dropped the first single from his next album berzerk but people were a little unimpressed they feel as if he tried too hard to get that 1990s style to return some also found the beat and the fast rapping of common everyday sounds unappealing to listen to

• destruction but then em dropped this gem 6 minutes of straight fast hard grimy rap no hook either and in the wake of control no less a couple years ago we thought this guy was done and know hes not just saying hes a king hes a god this had the rap world buzzing a sighting of the old em the legendary em had the people like this6 suit and tieon january 14th justin timberlake shocked the world by dropping this single and announcing a new album was in the works but there was a reason this was the most talked about

• return the record brought all the timberlake fans back and he gained even more plays with that jay z feature everyone was bumping this and was surprised by its mix of genres pop hop it instantly became a hit and the return of jt had moved into full effect
• reiterate six long years we survived with no jt album but this single was only a sign of things to come as this record later brought a new jt album and a tour with jay and it became a nice comeback single and a summer anthem jt has since released a sequel to that album as an obvious comeback has now been started7 new slavesokay so kanye came to attack and thats the beginning of why its so talked about

• courage this is kanye west this man is one of the most controversial artists of our generation and he has a erhh special way of putting that into lyrics sometimes kanye is outspoken above many musicians today and this resulted in a rarity there was no radio edit released therefore stations couldnt play the track as they normally would this was the whole point of the song ye was not going to feed the corporations and follow the conventional paid promotional tactics he was going to try to abolish that way of thinking and still make a hit song

• corporate kanye took no prisoners kanye attacks topics ranging from racism critic responses materialism and the major corporations in the world he was unforgiving in his attack on the injustices these powerful institutions people and ideas inflict on society its all part of his plan to make people realize that we can be anything we want to be in life we just need to escape the powers that be and the tools they use to keep us down

• cunning kanye also found unique ways to promote the track from a highlyanticipated saturday night live performance and his mysterious projections of the song on various buildings across 66 different locations around the world all of these played into garnering attention right before the albums release and a boost in promo or as he would see it a boost in the number of people who see his message8 hold on were going homejust hold on were going homeheres why it was so popular

• popularity if you have somehow avoided this song whether sung by drake or one of your friends you gotta be on some dark magic shit if your girl has not played this your friend your little sister  somebody  i applaud you for living under a rock

• powerful with a melody that captures just about everyone this song was truly a fever the summer embraced hold on and you couldnt deny how good it felt and as a result it was all over radios everywhere not to mention drake does a good job of not cursing or using any controversial subject matter you know what that means right endless airplay everywhere

• peculiar this not only got airplay but think about how different this was the rest of drakes album and other rappers songs kanye jay eminem j cole big sean were focused on lyricism and or straight rap but not drizzy he dropped this right on the heels of his rap heavy song all me he straight up sang this song the whole way through an unexpected release that kept us all guessing what he would do nextits me and 40 just channeling our quincy jonesmichael jackson production duo obviously no offense to the greats i know were not anywhere near that — its just us kinda doing our thing humbly attempting its not a rap record its not versace its not started from the bottom in approaching this album i was like man it would be great if we had a record that was played at weddings in 10 years or that people that are away from their families in the army could listen to something that just has timeless writing timeless melody so i did it with the group that we signed to ovo called majid jordan9 wrecking ballmiley miley miley this single came out at the height of summer miley mayhem as if she couldnt get more controversial than we cant stop miley outdid herself here are the main reasons were talking about it

• lewd the entire video which dropped as the song did was miley sitting in undies or straight up naked on a wrecking ball the beat coupled with mileys voice makes it slightly enticing to everybody though so you kinda couldnt stop watching err listening but come on miley licking steel hammers was just too weird for most people regardless of who was doing it and some people still couldnt quite grasp that this was once their favorite disney channel star

• laughs it has been subject to several parodies shes licking a sledge hammer the most popular is probably this one10 get luckyeven though it is the short track on the list this song made waves and made people talk

• pharrell this beat  pharrell  addicting nuff said

• punk although daft punk hadnt released an album since 2005 this single got people hyped as in mostplaysinasingledayonspotify hyped this brought about a revival of excitement around the duo and meant it was played incessantly in clubs and on radiostvs across the globe
