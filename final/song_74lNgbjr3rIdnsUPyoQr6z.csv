i just wanna rap for ninety seconds without breathing
here we go im gonna try it hopefully i wont be screamin
by the end of it i cannot take a single breath man not even a little bit
i hope this aint a target that i didnt hit
and all these rappers out right now are faker than an instagram booty
im like a jedi when i rap i shoulda been in the movies
you gotta understand a couple things about me
im a kansas city native and im bustin hella rowdy
got a house up in the hills i got a castle where i chill
im always workin on my raps and always practicin this skill
man you should never sleep on me like im a cactus in your pillow
hear the instrumental then i kick a track out with a steel toe
everybody listenin to all this mumble rap is terrible
you open up my brain i bet it is twentyfourkarat gold
you know that when i rap its hella dope sit hear the vibes
youre on my youtube channel now oh man i hope you will subscribe
so look somebody tried to say that when youre livin underwater
its impossible to breathe and i just gotta disagree
cause when im rappin not a single bit of oxygen is sit
ting in my lungs and im relaxin at the bottom of the sea
you see my wife and i were ridin in the car today and started fightin
and i just left her walked into the studio and started writin
i decided that i was gonna rap without a single breath and
if it didnt bring my death then fuck it it would be refreshin
i am a believer in the universes sorrow
i just wish that i could move away to jupiter tomorrow
time and time again i sit around im patiently jut waitin for the weekend
twentythousand years ago i was a pharaoh back in egypt
with a coat of gold and feathers and a crown of thorns
see i invented thunderstorms and all the ways that clouds could form
see i was born abused gingers going to the kingdom of the science
and my mother was a singer to the sciences
i navigate the globe they call me leader to the lions and
my wings are made of fire ima bring you to the tiger
ima feed you to a tiger motherfucker i cannot breathe
i fear get the lyrics anybody gonna try to leave
i gotta try to mumble now i gotta do a freestyle
everybody knows that im gonna get a little senile
