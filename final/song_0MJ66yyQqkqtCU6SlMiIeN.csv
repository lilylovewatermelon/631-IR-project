sat on the rooftop
watching the birds flying free
watching the clouds walk
and watching the rain become the sea
hearing my love talk
in every breath she ever breathes
like it was always supposed to be like that

verse 2
but then we broke up oh no
and she went west and i went east
she got a new boyfriend oh no
a little too soon if youre asking me
but ive heard that she loves him
a little bit more than shell ever love me
and it was always supposed to be like that

chorus
i looked to the skyline i said
how many falls until i fly
looked to the old times i said
how many wrongs until im right
i know its tough now
cause love always love always is unkind

i sat on the rooftop
and i watched the birds flying free
i watched the clouds walk oh
and i watched the rain become the sea
and just for a moment yeah oh
just for a moment i felt so free
from all im supposed to be

chorus
i looked to the skyline i said
how many falls until i fly
looked to the old times i said
how many wrongs until im right
i know its tough now
cause love always love always is unkind9embed"
