i dont have a filter like this cigarette
ask me my opinion thats what youre gonna get
you know i dont say dang when i mean damn
with you ive only ever been who i am

chorus
i cant lie to you cause i cant lie to me
so dont ask if you dont want total honesty
ive been drivin ive been cryin but i swear i aint been drinkin
even i cant believe im sayin what im thinkin

verse 2
well im good at hangin on to what im holdin
but ive never been a fan of sugarcoatin
you know i wont say stay when i mean bye
and i hope for your sake you dont ask why

chorus
i cant lie to you cause i cant lie to me
so dont ask if you dont want total honesty
ive been drivin ive been cryin but i swear i aint been drinkin
even i cant believe im sayin what im thinkin

bridge
to tell the truth im not sure which hurts worse
to be the one who hears or the one who says these words

i cant lie to you cause i cant lie to me
so dont ask if you dont want total honesty
ive been drivin ive been cryin but i swear i aint been drinkin
even i cant believe im sayin what im thinkin
