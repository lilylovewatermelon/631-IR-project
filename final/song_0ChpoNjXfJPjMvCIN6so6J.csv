this may never start
we could fall apart
and id be your memory
lost your sense of fear
feelings insincere
can i be your memory

chorus
so get back back back to where we lasted
just like i imagine
i could never feel this way
so get back back back to the disaster
my hearts beating faster
holding on to feel the same

verse 2
this may never start
ill tear us apart
can i be your enemy
losing half a year
waiting for you here
id be your anything

chorus
so get back back back to where we lasted
just like i imagine
i could never feel this way
so get back back back to the disaster
my hearts beating faster
holding on to feel the same
you might also likeinstrumental break

bridge
this may never start
tearing out my heart
and id be your memory
lost your sense of fear
feelings disappeared
can i be your memory

chorus
so get back back back to where we lasted
just like i imagine
i could never feel this way
so get back back back to the disaster
my hearts beating faster
holding on to feel the same

outro
this may never start
we could fall apart
and id be your memory
lost your sense of fear
feelings insincere
can i be your memory1embed"
