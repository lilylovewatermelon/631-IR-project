sleep on me
feel the rhythm in my chest just breathe
i will stay
so the lantern in your heart wont fade

chorus jon bellion
the secrets you tell me ill take to my grave
theres bones in my closet but you hang stuff anyway
and if you have nightmares well dance on the bed
i know that you love me love me
even when i lose my head
guillotine guillotine
even when i lose my head
guillotine guillotine
even when i lose my head

verse 2 jon bellion
kiss my lips
feel the rhythm of your heart and hips
i will pray
so the castle that weve built wont cave

chorus jon bellion
the secrets you tell me ill take to my grave
theres bones in my closet but you hang stuff anyway
and if you have nightmares well dance on the bed
i know that you love me love me
even when i lose my head
guillotine guillotine
even when i lose my head
guillotine guillotine
even when i lose my head
