theres a thousand ways to meet you now
theres a thousand ways to track you down
whatever you said﻿ and done
theres a﻿ thousand ways to make it count
there is nothing that can touch me now
you cant even break me down
every time you think of some
its all ready been did and done

hook
can i be your best friend
can i make it to the end
can you give me some of what
you went and gave them
come walk with me
you aint gotta shake it just be with me
you aint gotta throw your hands in the air
cause tonight we aint actin like we dont care
its cool it takes two﻿ im gonna still fux with you
almost there

tryna feel like what that feels like
when someone makes you feel alright
we can take the same path tonight

verse 3
what doesnt kill us it makes us stronger
thats why my roads get longer and longer
my tracks are less traveled here to uganda
can we touch base just to discuss agenda
