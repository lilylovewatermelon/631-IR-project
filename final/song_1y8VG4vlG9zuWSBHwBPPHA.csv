deep deep deep deep in the ocean
is a waterproof wristwatch that was dropped
from a boat on a cruise by a man full of booze
but even without a wrist it never stopped
through an accidental accident at the factory
it was made so that it never need be wound
for the watch ran on love which it had plenty of
for deep in the ocean theres plenty of love to be found

chorus
below the boats and sky
theres no such thing as time
there is no need for tryin to
put it together put it together
i believe well someday lose our feet
pick up some gills and travel

verse 2
deep deep deep deep in the ocean
and enjoy a life that never should get old
but it can and it will for well be human still
and wherever ocean real estate is sold
well be buying and selling and always propelling it forwards
and the leader of the fish will take a stand
and we shall see it swim with a wristwatch on its fin
and the race of fish will be taking over our land

the fish will take our seats
the schools the farms the streets
and well be stuck down deep and
maybe well never put it together

bridge
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean and motionless
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean therell be no sun anymore

chorus
below the boats and sky
theres no such thing as time
there is no need for tryin to
put it together well be forever

bridge
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean and motionless
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean and motionless
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean and motionless
deep in the ocean
deep in the ocean and motionless
outro
so much for our fish friends loose ends
cant be tied tied
old selves have died
goggleeyed and chased by whales
swimmin zoomin
mermaid tails almost human
skin turned to scales
i conclude
weve become seafood
weve become seafood
weve become seafood
weve become seafood1embed"
