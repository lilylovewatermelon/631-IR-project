and be my mistake
then turn out the light
she bought me those jeans
the ones you like
i dont wanna hug
i just wanna sleep
the smell of your hair
reminds me of her feet

prechorus
so dont wait outside my hotel room
just wait till i give you a sign
cause i get lonesome sometimes

chorus
save all the jokes youre gonna make
while i see how much drink i can take
then be my mistake

verse 2
i shouldnt have called
cause we shouldnt speak
you do make me hard
but she makes me weak
