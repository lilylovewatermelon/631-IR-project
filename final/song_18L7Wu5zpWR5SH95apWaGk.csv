i dreamed i held you in my arms
but when i awoke dear i was mistaken
and i hung my head and i cried

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away

ill always love you and make you happy
if you will only say the same
but if you leave me and love another
youll regret it all someday

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away

you told me once dear you really loved me
and no one could come between
but now youve left me to love another
you have shattered all of my dreams

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
you might also likein all my dreams dear you seem to leave me
when i awake my poor heart pangs
so wont you come back and make me happy
ill forgive dear ill take all the blame

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine awayembed"
