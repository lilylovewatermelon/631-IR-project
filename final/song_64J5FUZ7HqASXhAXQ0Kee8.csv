i walk a hard line winding road
dont really know where its gonna go
seems like troubles my best friend
soon as i get out im back in again
its a wonder i aint all alone

chorus
cause it aint easy
no it aint easy
it aint easy loving me

verse 2
dont why know i do the things i do
must be i love to light the fuse
stand back and watch it crash and burn and turn into ash
just like it aint nothing
she aint something i can lose

chorus
cause it aint easy
no it aint easy
it aint easy loving me

verse 3
shes the brick by brick that built this house
without her it would all fall down
so now she finds the faith and the strength to believe
dont know why she sticks around

cause it aint easy
no it aint easy
it aint easy loving me
cause it aint easy
no it aint easy
