yeah baby

verse 1
i dont wanna wait until its friday
before we hit it sideways
im out in your driveway right now
and we aint gotta wait until its your birthday
im already thirsty time to shut the workday on down
yeah i just dropped you off but im back to pick you up
no i cant get enough need a little more you in my cup
i wanna see you move get my hands on you
my little déjà vu we do this every night

chorus
we can get to feeling alright right now
turn it on baby til the sun burns out
you aint gotta say it girl i know what you like
we do this every night
yeah on this trail trail a little something to sip sip
dont need no weekend
we do this every night
hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
a little bit of your sweet kiss
we do this every night

when the song is over we put it on repeat repeat
topping off another can of crazy
neighbors probably hate me
they dont get the way we do it every night

turn it on baby til the sun burns out
you aint gotta say it girl i know what you like
we do this every night
yeah on this trail trail a little something to sip sip
dont need no weekend

hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
a little bit of your sweet kiss
