time present and time past
are both perhaps present in time future
and time future contained in time past
if all time is eternally present
all time is unredeemable
what might have been is an abstraction
remaining a perpetual possibility
only in a world of speculation
what might have been and what has been
point to one end which is always present
footfalls echo in the memory
down the passage which we did not take
towards the door we never opened
