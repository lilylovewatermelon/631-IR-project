they told me you were leaving
if jupiter is moving
then maybe you should stay

heaven doesnt know me
as much as you have shown me
your happiness is happy
my envy is in rage

turn low the radio
silence resume again
fly high the brightest light
dont let me put you out

green eyes on a blueeyed child
please can you stay a while
green eyes on a blueeyed child
please can you stay stay

maybe ill wait
until my thoughts about you change
and the love that i once had returns againyou might also likeembed"
