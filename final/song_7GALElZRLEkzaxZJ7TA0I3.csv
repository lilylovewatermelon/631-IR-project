im just gonna stay til you tell me to go
i only wanna hear what i already know
but i just wanna hear it said out loud
leave me alone god damn you get out
im just gonna stay til you tell me to leave
ill climb onto your bed and ill get under the sheets
just until you look me straight in the eye
point to the door say good luck and goodbye
and im just gonna stay til you give me a reason
im not gonna let you let me down easy
not until i hear it straight from your mouth
hes coming over i dont want you around
so im just gonna sit here and stare at your lips
i wont read it in your face i wont take any hints
you only used me til someone real came along
tell me the truth or tell me im wrong

outro
what good are words what good are words
your heart is breaking
what good are words what good are words
i tried to tell you you said you already knew
what good are words what good are words
your time is up your time is up
what good are words what good are words
i was as honest as i knew how to be
what good are words what good are words
your heart is breaking
what good are words what good are words
i couldve betrayed you
what good are words what good are words
your time is up your time is up
what good are words what good are words
you tricked me into loving you
im telling you that very frankly and honestly if i did fall in love with you it would still have to end in the same wayyou might also like4embed"
