the mirrors image tells me its home time
but im not finished cause youre not by my side
and as i arrived i thought i saw you leavin
carryin your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreamin
of bumpin into you

chorus
now its three in the mornin
and im tryna change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
whyd you only call me when youre high
hi whyd you only call me when youre high

verse 2
somewhere darker talkin the same shite
i need a partner high well are you out tonight
its harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of makin alright decisions
and having bad ideas

chorus
now its three in the mornin
and im tryna change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply message you reply
whyd you only call me when youre high
whyd you only call me when youre
hi whyd you only call me when youre high
you might also likebridge
and i cant see you here wonder where i might
it sort of feels like im runnin out of time
i havent found all i was hopin to find
you said you got to be up in the mornin
gonna have an early night
and youre startin to bore me baby
whyd you only call me when youre high

outro
whyd you only ever phone me when youre high
whyd you only ever phone me when youre high
whyd you only ever phone me when youre high
whyd you only ever phone me when youre high227embed"
