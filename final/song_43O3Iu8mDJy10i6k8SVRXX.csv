baby you should know by now that i’m right for you
but every time i step to you you change your tune
sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
i step to the right you move to the left
and theres no one else id rather die to myself

chorus
oh why wont you make up your mind
i think i must confess im starting to unwind
ive been tripping over you so tell me something new
take it or leave it

verse 2
maybe i should pack my things and move on
maybe im fooling myself and youre already gone
watching the flames wither and fade
trying to make sense of the look on your face
im down on my knees just praying that i can hold on

chorus
oh why wont you make up your mind
i think i must confess im learning to unwind
ive been tripping over you so tell me something new
take it or leave it
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likebridge
baby please oh baby please
stay with me or cut me free
it’s killing me

chorus
oh why wont you make up your mind
i think i must confess im starting to unwind
ive been tripping over you so tell me something new
take it or leave it
take it or leave it18embed"
