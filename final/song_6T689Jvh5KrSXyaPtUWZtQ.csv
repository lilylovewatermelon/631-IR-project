he is a hustler hes no good at all
he is a loser hes a bum bum bum bum
he lies he bluffs hes unreliable
he is a sucker with a gun gun gun gun
i know you told me i should stay away
i know you said hes just a dog astray
hes a bad boy with a tainted heart
and even i know this aint smart

chorus
but mama im in love with a criminal
and this type of love isnt rational its physical
mama please dont cry i will be alright
all reason aside i just cant deny love the guy

verse 2
he is a villain by the devils law
he is a killer just for fun fun fun fun
the mans a snitch and unpredictable
hes got no conscience he got none none none none
ohoh i know oh shouldve let go but no
cause hes a bad boy with a tainted heart
and even i know this aint smart

chorus
but mama im in love with a criminal
and this type of love isnt rational its physical
mama please dont cry i will be alright
all reason aside i just cant deny love the guy

and i hear people talk people talk

and this type of love isnt rational its physical
mama please dont cry i will be alright

but no its physical
oh i know oh mama please dont cry i will be alright
