listen up theres not a moment to spare
its quite a drop from the top so how you feeling down there
it’s a cold cruel harsh reality
caught stuck here with your enemies

prechorus
who do you think you are
tearing us all apart
where did you think you could go
cause everyone already knows
it’s twenty to one
yeah so you better run

chorus
you got the world on its knees
you’re taking all that you please
you want more you want more
but you’ll get nothing from me
you’re like the burden we bear
you’re all the hate that we share
you want more you want more
but you’ll get nothing from me
but enemies
enemies
