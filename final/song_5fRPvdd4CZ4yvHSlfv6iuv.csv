automated voice hello please leave a message after the tone
bob sanders rip hey just calling you back
im feeling pretty good today actually didnt throw up at all
yeah tomorrow i got this procedure
i think everything is gonna go smooth there though
um im hoping anyway
i need some good news for once

verse 1
dont wanna hear its over
what a rude awakening
the angel of death has come
and ripped you from our lives
i cant stand the devastation
relentless agony
hope that i get to see you
on the other side

prechorus
blue sky has turned to blackest night
now youre gone it just isnt right

chorus
save our last goodbye
embedded in my mind
your face will never leave me
save our last goodbye
its killing me that i wont get to hear
your laughter anymore
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
what faith i had is broken
and i question everything
and those shards of doubt
begin to penetrate my heart
with every waking hour
within everything i see
the shadows of your loss
are tearing me apart

prechorus
blue sky has turned to blackest night
now youre gone it just isnt right

chorus
save our last goodbye
embedded in my mind
your face will never leave me
save our last goodbye
its killing me that i wont get to hear
your laughter anymore

interlude
automated voice were sorry
this mailbox is full and cannot take your messages
bridge
my world is shattered in disarray
im beaten down drained emotionally
they say in time the pain goes away
but in my soul it will forever stay

chorus
save our last goodbye
embedded in my mind
your face will never leave me
save our last goodbye
its killing me that i wont get to hear
your laughter

save our last goodbye
embedded in my mind
your face will never leave me
save our last goodbye
its killing me that i wont get to hear
your laughter anymore

outro
automated voice were sorry
