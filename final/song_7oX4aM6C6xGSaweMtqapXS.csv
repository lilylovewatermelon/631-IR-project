my race has nearly run
my strongest trials now are past
my triumph is begun

o come angel band come and around me stand
o bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
o bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home

o bear my longing heart to him
who bled and died for me
whose blood now cleanses from all sin
and gives me victory

o come angel band come and around me stand
o bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
o bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal homeyou might also like1embed"
