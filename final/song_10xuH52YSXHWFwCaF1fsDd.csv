verse 1
ayy
i saw your sister at work
i saw your mama at church
im pretty sure i saw your car at the mall
i see your face in the clouds
i smell your perfume in crowds
i swear your numbers all my phone wants to call

prechorus
its kinda funny how i cant seem
to get away from you
its almost like you dont want me to

chorus
youve got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
i got a bottle of whiskey but i got no proof
that you showed up tonight
in that dress just to mess with my head
so much for so long
out of sight out of mind
girl youre lookin so good
its drivin me out of mine
oh youre breakin my heart
baby youre playin hard to forget

told me to leave all your things
out on the porch on the swing
youd come and grab em by the end of the week
well its just some jeans and a shirt
but its a whole lot of hurt
i think i know why youve been dragging your feet

prechorus
aint it funny how i cant seem
to get away from you
its almost like you dont want me to

chorus
youve got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
i got a bottle of whiskey but i got no proof
that you showed up tonight
in that dress just to mess with my head
so much for so long
out of sight out of mind
girl youre lookin so good
its drivin me out of mine
oh youre breakin my heart
baby youre playin hard to forget
