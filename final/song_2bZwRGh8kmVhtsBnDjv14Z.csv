hello seattle i am a mountaineer
in the hills and highlands
i fall asleep in hospital parking lots
and awake in your mouth

verse 2
hello seattle i am a manta ray
deep beneath the blue waves
ill crawl the sandy bottom of puget sound
and construct a summer home

verse 3
hello seattle i am the crescent moon
shining down on your face
i will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
and descend inside of you

verse 4
hello seattle i am a cold seahorse
feeling warm in your sand
i sing about the tide and the ocean surf
rolling in the evening breeze

verse 5
hello seattle i am an albatross
on the docks and moored boats
i sail above your inlets and interstates
through the rain and open wind
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likeverse 6
hello seattle i am an old lighthouse
throwing beams of bright light
red in the morning blue in the evening sun
taking heed for everyone

bridge
hello seattle i am a mountaineer
in the hills and highlands
i fall asleep in hospital parking lots

take me above your light
carry me through the night
hold me secure in flight
sing me to sleep tonight

outro
take me above your light hello seattle i am a mountaineer
carry me through the night in the hills and highlands
hold me secure in flight i fall asleep in hospital parking lots
sing me to sleep tonight and awake1embed"
