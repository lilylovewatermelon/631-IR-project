well i cant fall asleep and im losing my mind
cause its halfpast three and my brains on fire
i been counting sheep but the sheep all died

i been counting sheep but the sheep all died
and im not dead yet so i guess ill be alright

its stupid but its all i have
dont you love it dont you love it
no i aint happy yet but im way less sad
