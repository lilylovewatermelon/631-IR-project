like a bird on a wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free

verse
like a fish on a hook
like a knight from an old fashioned book
i have saved all my ribbons with thee
and if i have been unkind
i hope that you will just let it go by
and if i have been untrue
i hope you know it was never to you
like a baby stillborn
like a beast with his horn
i have torn everyone who reached out for me
but i swear by this song
by all i have done wrong
ill make it all up to you
i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
he called out to me donâ€™t ask for so much
and a young man leaning on his darkened door
he cried out to me hey why not ask for more

outro
like a bird on a wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be freeyou might also likeembed"
