leaning in a dark room
a look alike james wright
when all my life i’ve been rejecting
what will i say yes to
what did i say yes to
i’d been cutting glass carefully
all my time was spent alone
i didn’t expect you

chorus
what did i say yes to
what did i say
been talking ‘bout you so much
i’m talking you away
what did i say yes to
what did i say
i’ve been talking about you so much
i’m talking you away yeah

verse 2
cooking up some mushroom ah
in my kitchen
tryna tell you about my month
you’re only halflistening
i know i never listen ah
how can i your eyes bloom
slanted yellow in the blinds
bleeding into a dark room
you might also likechorus
so how could i say yes to you
what should i say
i’ve been talking ‘bout you so much
im talking you away
yeah what did i say yes to
what did i say
i’ve been thinking ‘bout you so much
i think i’m thinking you away

outro
im opening it up now
what a plunge what a lark
im picking all the seeds out
im peeling off the bark
im picking all the seeds out
im breaking it apart
im opening it up now
im peeling off the barkembed"
