verse 1
times is gettin hard and my money got older
droppin back the top i got the world on my shoulder
over and over gotta pour up gotta roll up
gotta cover up my war wounds no time to be sober
flawless clarity blindin my demons
you givin life a new meanin when you dreamin
on the block we was schemin servin fiends and
rollin dice on the cement yeah
i came from nothin no i dont want from nothin
they schemin on my blessings yeah
couldve been the devil but maybe it was karma
surrounded by the drama oh yeah
need to get my conscience back
i can feel chronic in my chest
sometimes i feel like im runnin out of breath
hustlin until the sun come
feelin like the last don left
