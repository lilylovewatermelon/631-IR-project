its easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
its so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone

verse 1 chester bennington
something has been taken from deep inside of me
a secret ive kept locked away no one can ever see
wounds so deep they never show they never go away
like moving pictures in my head for years and years theyve played

prechorus mike shinoda with chester bennington
if i could change i would take back the pain i would
retrace every wrong move that i made i would
if i could stand up and take the blame i would
if i could take all the shame to the grave i would
if i could change i would take back the pain i would
retrace every wrong move that i made i would
if i could stand up and take the blame i would
i would take all my shame to the grave

chorus chester bennington
its easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
its so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone

bringing back these memories i wish i didnt have
sometimes i think of letting go and never looking back
and never moving forward so thered never be a past

prechorus mike shinoda with chester bennington
if i could change i would take back the pain i would

if i could take all the shame to the grave i would
if i could change i would take back the pain i would
retrace every wrong move that i made i would
if i could stand up and take the blame i would
i would take all my shame to the grave

bridge chester bennington
just washing it aside
all of the helplessness inside
pretending i dont feel misplaced
is so much simpler than change
