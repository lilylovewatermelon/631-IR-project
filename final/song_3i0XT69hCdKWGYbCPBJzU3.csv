youll never leave me
youll never leave me
youll never leave me
youll never leave me

verse 1
i wish we could have another minute to finish this fairytale
hear your voice and get lost in it
cause all i got is broken details
you were my world and everything in it
so how did you disappear
i wont say this is over
youre still here

chorus
youre my shadow my shadow
i know youre close
youre my shadow my shadow
everywhere i go
so i i dont see the need to cry
cause youll never leave my life
youre my shadow my shadow oh

postchorus
youll never leave me
youll never leave me
youll never leave me
youll never leave me
no youll never leave me

promise ill keep all your secrets
to have you back would be my only wish
cause nobody knew me like you did

count to ten and i know you will appear

cause youll never leave my life
