you and i were meant to be
aint no doubt about it
no way to hide that sort of thing
now im waiting for something better
aint nothing better worth imagining

prechorus
but i i keep on running
im building bridges that i know you never wanted
look for my heart you stole it away
now own every single road that i could take

chorus
listen i
want you to burn my bridges down down
i said i
want you to burn my bridges down down down
set me on fire
you set me set me on fire
you can burn my bridges down

verse 2
send this out to sea
send it where you want it
you can take your no for no or not at all
theres no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
imaginary faces they dont work at all
