i think ill lie a little longer
wait for the crowds to go
maybe ill die in this unholy mass
and ill be free

yes thats what they say that i would be
when we came to watch the world be over
but theres too many fools
on this boat that we made
i can hardly see the water

whats happened to me
i was down on my knees
i was praying to leave
but i never know when ive gone too far

this disaster in me
what a beautiful dream
that told me id be cleaner
told me id be closer to god

oh the birds of paradise
came to me yesterday
laughed when they told me my fate
wed be cold wed be tired but we could breathe
and one day im gonna leave this place
you might also likewhats happened to me
i was down on my knees
i was praying to leave
but i never know when ive gone too far

this disaster in me
what a beautiful dream
that told me id be cleaner
told me id be closer to godembed"
