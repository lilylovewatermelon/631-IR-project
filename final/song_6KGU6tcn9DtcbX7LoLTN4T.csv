love is a game that we could play
even only for today
i don’t wanna lose you
we’ve been apart for far too long
now we only have a song
let the music move you

prechorus neon trees
there was a part of me
that never left a part of you
i wish i could be everything you wanted

chorus neon trees
but i’m still young
wideeyed and hopeless
yeah i’m still young
i want your devotion to this
can we kiss like we do in my head
can we dance like we do on my bed
oh like we’re still young

verse two neon trees
love is a loss that we incur
when we gamble with the world
i don’t wanna lose you
i feel my life has just begun
i can hear you singalong
now the musics in you
you might also likeprechorus neon trees
there was a part of me
that never left a part of you
i wish i could be everything you wanted

chorus neon trees
but i’m still young
wideeyed and hopeless
yeah i’m still young
i want your devotion to this
can we kiss like we do in my head
can we dance like we do on my bed
oh like we’re still young

bridge neon trees
baby don’t you cry
i won’t tell you lies
i’ll just sit and sing you lullabies lullabies
baby dont you cry
i wont tell you lies
ill just sit and sing you lullabies

chorus neon trees
cause i’m still young
wideeyed and hopeless
yeah i’m still young
i want your devotion to this
can we kiss like we do in my head
can we dance like we do on my bed
oh like we’re still youngembed"
