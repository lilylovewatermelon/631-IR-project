to get me a’pay
i’m gonna get me outta here
i got me some cash
i’m heading back to la
i’m gonna get me outta here

i’m sacking the man
‘cause the man is a thief
i’m kicking the plan
before the plan kicks me
i’m gonna get me
get me out of here
i’m gonna get me
get me out of here

i went down to the duke
10 time a day
i’m gonna get me outta here
drink all night and talking shit all day
i’m gonna get me outta here

i’m sacking the man
‘cause the man is a thief
i’m kicking the plan
before the plan kicks me
i’m gonna get me
get me out of here
i’m gonna get me
get me out of here
you might also likei don’t mind how i live my life
without the luck you got
i ain’t tryin’ to keep in time
so just keep off my ride
you won’t hang your rusty sign on me

i went down to the bank
just to get me my pay
get me outta here
i’m gonna get me
get me outta here
i’m gonna get me
get me outta hereembed"
