cherry stem with her mouth she could tie in a knot
favourite trick she does one in ten that shes got
making friends setting trends hardly having to try
all the looks by the book best that money can buy

chorus
look what your money bought
its all that shes got
it keeps her company
straight from mom and daddy

verse
last chance to dance out in back of the bar
shaking hands nice to meet you i dont know who you are
she has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man
never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can

chorus
look what your money bought
its all that shes got
it keeps her company
straight from mom and daddy
look what your money bought
its all that shes got
it keeps her company
straight from mom and daddy

chorus

it keeps her company
straight from mom and daddy
look what your money bought
its all that shes got
it keeps her company
