let the church say amen
release all my sins at the pulpit
its the beginning
its the beginning of mice and men
you hold my hand as an infant
palms to the sky adonai ya allah
till they all come down
till we all fall down
down

chorus
lines drawn in the sand
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride
when you dont know yourself
if it hurts you to explain your god in my eyes
just ride
lines drawn in the sand
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride

verse 2
up here the air is so thin
mountains on my fingertips
i stand at the tippy screaming at the top of my lungs
tears in my eyes
adonai ya allah answer my calls if you hear me
adonai ya allah answer my calls if youre near me

lines drawn in the sand
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride
when you dont know yourself
if it hurts you to explain your god in my eyes
just ride
lines drawn in the sand
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride
when you dont know yourself
if it hurts you to explain your god in my eyes
just ride
