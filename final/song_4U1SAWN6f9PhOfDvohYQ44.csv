you cant tell from the look because they close your eyes
and whisper sweet melodies

i cant stay locked inside all day
when will i leave my pyramid

dont go inside because they take your eyes
and keep you forever cause youre paralyzed
and whisper sweet melodies

i cant stay in this tomb forever
please let me leave your pyramidyou might also likeembed"
