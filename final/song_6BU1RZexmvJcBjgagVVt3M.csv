we may not know which way to go on this dark road
mr duckworth
all of these hoes make it difficult
session 10 breakthrough

verse 1 kendrick lamar
one of these lives ima make things right
with the wrongs ive done thats when i unite
with the father son til then i fight
rain on me put the blame on me
got guilt got hurt got shame on me
got six magazines thats aimed at me
done every magazine whats fame to me
and im tripping and falling
its a game to me where the bedroom at
sleep i aint nevеr had affairs with that
whats fair when the hearts and thе words dont reach
whats fair when the money dont take things back
its rare when somebody take your dreams back
and im tripping and falling
i care too much wanna share too much in my head too much
i shut down too i aint there too much
im a complex soul they layered me up
then broke me down and moralitys dust i lack in trust
and im tripping and falling
this time around i trust myself
please everybody else but myself
all else fails i was myself
outdone fear outdone myself
this year you better one yourself
and im tripping and falling
masks on the babies mask on an opp
wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
but a mask wont hide who you are inside
look around the realitys carved in lies
wipe my ego dodge my pride
and im tripping and falling
look myself in the mirror
amityville aint seen nothin scarier
i fought like a pitbull terrier
blood i shed could fill up aquariums
tell all my angels carry em
and im tripping and falling
every emotion been deprived
even my strong points couldnt survive
if i didnt learn to love myself forgive myself a hundred times dawg

verse 2 kendrick lamar
you said id feel better if i just worked hard without liftin my head up
that left me fed up
you made me worry
i wanted my best version but you ignored me
then changed the story then changed the story
good energy in the room drop the location please
antibiotic for the womb when im frustrated please
antibiotic for the womb when im frustrated
tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
thoughts in my head they livin there with no— tryna keep my good
i made a decision never give you my feelings
fuck with you from fuck with you from a distance
some put it on the devil when they fall short
i put it on my ego lord of all lords
