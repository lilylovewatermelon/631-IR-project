long ago just like the hearse you die to get in again
we are so far from you
burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate
the lives of everyone you know

prechorus
and whats the worst to take worst to take
from every heart you break heart you break
and like the blade you stain blade you stain
well ive been holding on tonight

chorus
whats the worst that i can say
things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight
so love your good night

verse 2
came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
we are the very hurt you sold

prechorus
and whats the worst you take worst you take
from every heart you break heart you break
and like the blade you stain blade you stain
well ive been holding on tonight

whats the worst that i can say
things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight
so long and goodnight
well if you carry on this way
things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight
so love your good night

bridge
can you hear me
are you near me
can we pretend to leave and then
well meet again
when both our cars collide

chorus
whats the worst that i can say
things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight
so long and goodnight
well if you carry on this way
things are better if i stay
so long and goodnight
so love your good night98embed"
