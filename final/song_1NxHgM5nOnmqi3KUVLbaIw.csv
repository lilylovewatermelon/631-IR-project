i dont know how we got to where we are
so far removed i dont know where to start
cause ive been away for far too long
but i implore you please hold on
i beg you please hold on

prechorus
love dont come easy to us
and its killing me to hang on
and hope its enough

chorus
so i was just wondering
could you tell me is it all a waste of time
are you leaving my love behind
baby say the word and let me know
you gotta give me something
i swear that i wont try to change your mind
if youre leaving my love behind
baby say the word and let me go

verse 2
we used to wait up and talk for hours on end
and its got me thinking that lately somethings changed
cause ive been feeling you leaving
cracks in conversations way too long
im barely holding on
