i guess you dont want me to repeat it
but everything i have to give ill give to you
its not like we planned it
you tried to stay but you could not stand it
to see me shut down slow as though it was an easy thing to do
listen when all of this around us will fall over
i tell you what were gonna do
hey
you will shelter me my love
and i i will shelter you
i will shelter you

i left you heartbroken
but not until those very words were spoken
has anybody ever made such a fool outta you
its hard to believe it
even as my eyes do see it
the very things that make you live theyre killing you
listen when all of this around us will fall over
i tell you what were gonna do

hey
you will shelter me my love
and i i will shelter you
i will shelter you
i will shelter you
i will shelter you
i will shelter you
you might also likelisten when all of this around us will fall over
i tell you what were gonna do

hey
you will shelter me my love
and i i will shelter you
if you shelter me too
i will shelter you
i will shelter you1embed"
