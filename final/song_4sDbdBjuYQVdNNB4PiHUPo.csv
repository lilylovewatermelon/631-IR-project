im leaving home for the coastline
some place under the sun
i feel my heart for the first time
cause now im moving on yeah im moving on

and theres a place that ive dreamed of
where i can free my mind
i hear the sounds of the season
and lose all sense of time

chorus
im moving far away
to a sunny place
where its just you and me
feels like were in a dream
you know what i mean

verse 2
the summer air by the seaside
the way it fills our lungs
the fire burns in the night sky
this life will keep us young yeah keep us young

and we will sleep by the ocean
our hearts will move with the tide
and we will wake in the morning
to see the sun paint the sky
see hollow coves liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likechorus

im moving far away
to a sunny place
where its just you and me
feels like were in a dream
you know what i mean

im moving far away
to a sunny place
where its just you and me
feels like were in a dream
