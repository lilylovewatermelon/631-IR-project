this is the moment for riders and thugs

poverty a bunch of minorities die in the club
they say my musics making em lose it i write it in blood
this is my music for all my people missing my music

satan shot my homie maintain with a missile and blew it
for the industry cause he was one of the truest
i dont know why they be pumpin its somethin maybe in the music

theyll do everything in their power to get a fast buck
no right or wrongs just killer bees out for your honeycomb
but youll find out when you bond out you can be free if your money long
ever been to one of my shows yeah it might be crazy
in ohio a chick got a little too hyphy baby
stage diving and crowd surfing couldnt hold back
but they dropped her now shes unconscious with her skull cracked
now when this happened it wasnt even during my set
they wanted me to give a signed poster to the hospital bet
when travis told me we got papers i thought he was playin

verse 5 skatterman
its skatterman cat strange musics black sheep why
cause im still countin money off the back streets ha

im one of a kind turn one into nine
blow your head off your shoulders dog its nothin but time nothin but time
and i never raise my voice you a bum why should i holler on you holler on you
with a whisper i can drop a couple of dollars on you
ssss sick them rottweilers on you
killers bustin out the windows of impalas on you
a made man in the streets i made grands
wrote lyrics about my life dropped a album and made fans
now im chillin on the tour with the redhead wonder redhead wonder

on the deuce next bitchass nigga fuckin with tech
gon get found in swope park with his nuts in his neck
verse 6 snug brim

snug brim kansas city missouri uzi groupies doobies and fins
you suzy qs aint no excuse for the sin so watch your tongue
if youre woofin ill get to shootin both you and your bitch
you just assumed youd try the shoes and theyd fit you never knew
that id lose you off in the section with your dude in the ditch
whether its reppin dog or movin them bricks
i keep it gutta little homie look my records see im doin it thick
as you can tell i aint no regular nigga im filled with star qualities
roll indo with bitches thats naked and watch the broads swallow me
its always solo you cant fake it so dont try to follow me
and you still cant get back up on your feet and right back where you ought to be
