yeah
we aint taking no prisoners right now
trust me
yo wiley
talking bare shit
gonna end up in a fucking hospital bed okay then

verse 1 devilman
its a joke them man are talking about theyre ready
but they dont really want no smoke
youre better off hanging yourself with a rope
trust me you wont be able to cope
nobody dont give a shit or believe one single thing comin out your throat
youre better off snorting an ounce of coke yeah
lets not forget i already murked off chip already murked off skep
i done my send and nobody did wanna send back
lets not forget when im on set make a mans girl get wet
i was always known as a threat cos i just spin
spin a man like a tornado
spin man like im tryna hit numbers on roulette
six million ways to die better choose
leave your face all over sky news
trying to war me is long like going on a two week mediterranean cruise
im guaranteed to win i cant lose
right about now im gonna blow my fuse
ive already won this dont even care if the send only gets ten thousand views
its all lunacy eradicate the problem like hoard immunity
you got no opportunity cos you got cancelled by the jewish community
war aint new to me so there aint nothing your shit bars can do to me
murk a mc brutally
make a big man look like he just hit puberty

you know what i mean yeah
we can go back to back or head to head live on stage
live on stage
release my anger release a bit of internal rage
release a bit of internal rage
send a mc to a early grave
youre not really on this youre not that brave wun sen

verse 2 devilman
i cant take no run off your mouth mc
shut down any down south mc
turn a grime mc to a house mc
pussio likkle mickey mouse mc
chat shit get banged in your mouth mc
come to your house and leave your house empty
if see wiley walking on the road
ill run a man down in my new blacked out m3 okay then
im still at this wipe off any mc off the atlas
you might need more practice dont pretend that hes on  like a catfish
make you do a cartwheel and a backflip
switch up the silent tactic
im out of this world im intergalactic
cant clash me youre not matchfit
like a poisonous snake im venomous
put a shell in your head top to be generous
i dont care about relevance
if youre putting in work then show me the evidence show me
dont insult my intelligence
not in tune with the elements
ill thunder lightning and rain on you
and make your kids claim inheritance
desperate times call for desperate measures
wileys one of them desperate bredders
my heart is cold like the coldest weathers
i leave mcs in next dilemmas
i make the place shake like earthquake tremors
program my brain like intel core processors
i cant fuck with wiley cos he hangs around with crossdressers
chorus devilman
you know what i mean yeah
we can go back to back or head to head live on stage
live on stage
release my anger release a bit of internal rage
release a bit of internal rage
send a mc to a early grave
youre not really on this youre not that brave wun sen
you know what i mean yeah
we can go back to back or head to head live on stage
live on stage
release my anger release a bit of internal rage
release a bit of internal rage
send a mc to a early grave
youre not really on this youre not that brave wun sen
