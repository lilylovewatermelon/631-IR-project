this morning youve got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
are you kidding

verse gruff rhys de la soul  both
yo retty packages of frosted delights
look it comes with a toy i like that
i want a number four number six and throw in a plastic donut
just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
rappers of many bite sizes
man are you freaking blind thats a rock
all mixed in the pot full
mommas homemade from scratch but not quite nope
toasted over flames they be tasting quite right

refrain posdnuos and dave
all hail king neptune and his waterbreathers
no snail thing too quick for his waterfeeders
dont waste time with your net
our net worth is set
ready go many know others but
we be the colors of the mad and the wicked
we be bad we rebrick it
with the twentyfour hour sign
shower mine habits
while you dine like rabbits
with the crunchy crunchy carrots
oh thats chicken
gotta have it super fast
you might also likeinterlude
a whole line of breakfasts youve got time for

chorus gruff rhys
super fast super fast i come in last
but just in time for breakfast
keep us through keep us through forever blue
the night the night throws at us
aluminum i crush for fun aluminum
the sea is radioactive the sea is radioactive

refrain posdnuos and dave
all hail king neptune and his waterbreathers
no snail thing too quick for his waterfeeders
dont waste time with your net
our net worth is set
ready go many know others but
we be the colors of the mad and the wicked
we be bad we rebrick it
with the twentyfour hours sign
shower mine habits
while you dine like rabbits
with the crunchy crunchy carrots
oh thats chicken
gotta have it super fast
chorus 2d
super fast super fast i come in last
but just in time for breakfast
keep us through keep us through forever blue
the night the night throws at us
aluminum i crush for fun aluminum
the sea is radioactive the sea is radioactive

outro 2d  posdnuos
