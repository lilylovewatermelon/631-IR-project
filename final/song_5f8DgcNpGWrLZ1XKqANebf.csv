i think were thinking too hard
so put on your shoes and get in your car
put it in drive point it this way
we dont have to talk you dont have to stay

chorus
but i aint got no one sleepin with me
and you aint got nowhere that you need to be
maybe i love you maybe im just kind of bored
it is what it is til it aint anymore

verse 2
weve tried being apart
but the truth is we are who we are
were so much alike it aint a good thing
too dumb to give up too stubborn to change

chorus
but i aint got no one sleepin with me
and you aint got nowhere that you need to be
maybe i love you maybe im just kind of bored
it is what it is til it aint anymore

instrumental break
you might also likebridge
til something better comes along
til whatever we have is gone

chorus
but i aint got no one sleepin with me
and you aint got nowhere that you need to be
maybe i love you maybe im just kind of bored
it is what it is til it aint anymore
yeah it is what it is til it aint anymore2embed"
