chorus

i love of my family i must entrust my sis mom and pops
make a commitment to be forgiven
i’m real not fake my lord forsakes i evade snakes
a game of chance i dance around the video
emotionally and spiritually inclined with a virtuous design
3x
you might also likei love my family since toy story came out back pack of stress on my back like andy
rollerblades for hands when i roll through the dusty streets on a winning streak
a role model like jesus with no followers i’m different
so i do the best i can with what i know
going to the big man upstairs on his office after hours
a slacker never a power pressure i’m more precise and clever on futuristic endeavors
talk about my problems share them like an alcoholics anonymous meeting
i learn that you get out what you put in
full strength with my musical prodigy and attain a network
my head hurts thank god i can be myself around my father and mother i ain’t a sucker l
volunteer for free when i perform i’m in the rear even though i’m mad i make it i’m clear
dam the end is near no fear i’m here flip it hot chef pan seared
pops a rolling stone and mother an angel in movies like angela bassett
people in life go by what they see not by what they know
when they die i can not bring them back extend them god fearing genius deep verses on my track
manic depressive on my room days paintbrush strokes van gogh pieces
or days filled up robust drinks squeeze energy out on a plate
humorous times i don’t think about bad feelings and wanna be drugs dealings

3x

insanity einstein spotted me out leprosy too much jealousy embedded in me
different moods make make me behave different i’m engraved in my conscious phase
what i think or did never kept me sober the theme is in the literature
no intentions of getting mad over mere matters
god give him the glory that is deserved
greetings earthlings i put my glasses on so i don’t face the hardship
at what cost do risk it all to stand amid the odds
tears in my eyes fears in my mind da vinci is on my heart
i listen i listen to my surrounding spider man senses’ tingling 
then i met my match let me light the devil up i spit fire around my kangol hat 
wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
stepped up to the base the hit the ball
chutes and ladders candyland mixed with a chess players pose
articulating my thoughts on paper in plain sight i aim for the high life 
teaching me a new lesson i’m on a quest for new message
forget the crazy people that want to hate cause in the end they won’t be around to what class celebrate
3x

my life is tolerable and valuable every move i made was fresh and calculable
you can’t be a kid forever you have to grow up someday
i exhale the bullshit i don’t want it to fester
sequestering these maddening circumstances
i want love honor respect and morality ingrained
left out the side off the doors in this crazy works like jim morrison
kind of scary when we pass away over the casket look at the mask what do you see jim carrey
wisdom and knowledge is better than mans riches why because it vanishes one day
life is serious and you cannot get your time by
i’m here for the duration i wait patient remain humble i’m bold and confident in the rumble
aiming to rid you of goliath effects i’m a play in an accordion spot on strike of a scorpion shot let the stings of life mettle in and be tight like a gordian’s knot
we are in love family romantic i speak my three languages
gauge the show i prep my operas no need for phantom
robin hood and king argthur bars i’m a legend in the making my errands are painstaking 
you can run from yourself but you can’t hide your true self
in the end my family is all i got so i seek my helpfamily

2x


i’m you it’s mike the angel tetris theme
big the old soul you a genius fir this one
keyboards on deck here we goooo
chorus

i’m not a doctor not a preacher not a teacher
going back deep in my mind like i’m having a seizure
i search the world for worth and debate my own motto
somebody said yo jim your a modern day aristotle 


v1

i’m an old soul trapped in a twenty fiver year old body
what happened to the thinkers from way back when
people dumbed down selling themselves short oh no
in the sky i’m deemed a star check out my astrology and astronomy
catch me a buzz like a bumble bee when i’m on set
land of the free home of the brave
you can dial into my vibe you can ride my wave
i hope and pray the walls don’t close in to what you say
insight gives you something to ponder in yonder i humbly stand
authority is only dictated by superiority pouting out inferiority and fear
you can’t be serious my grammar up to par not below average
i’m able to drink part twenty but i’m not a savage
i’m a cool nerd trying to get my ones right then blow up big like michael bloomberg
interacting with the common day man reaming messages putting out intellectual acuity
rumor has it i’m not doing what i am supposed to yes
coming to my senses i’m almost but not where i want to be yet


chorus 3x


v2

in your circle creating chemistry in our relationship
you know it’s going to be logical to physical
my lifestyle in my eyelids depicted as mystical
but you know my conversation is far from typical
let me waltz to your brain going to the back of your mind like psychology
just do your duty and simply try to honor me
don’t end my life cause i passed biology along time ago
now they want the classic villain to replace the hero but i say hell no
repping my own stepping to my throne accepting the stones thrown
jaded and disgusted remorseful punishments i make clear adjustments
yo my ideology is nestled in my heart carrying this vivid doctrine
a marvelous rap edited jester led lines i concocted
let my angels in and shun the devil out
pupils i know we can make it if we just try
reconcile hate speeches and effortlessly put our differences to the side
it’s a brash statement but you know it’s true


chorus

v3

in a seat i foresee a paining of gracious victory
a reincarnated professor when i die restored in athens school literally 
who would have thought big jim would be etched in history
the news media lambasts us and serrated our views to small pieces
you been hotter than the sun i’m good keep with the puns
i got my own philosophy somebody better put on the instrumental from krs one
i’m so blessed i can give a new toddler 75 years of info coming out his tongue
they can hate you know but try to shake your hand and thank you later 
hi haters i’m here for that edification surrealism embalmed in mathematical triangular prisms
i’m a bout to bounce back from my cave three days later they say jesus risen
no it’s just me big jim a little ominous with my right hand keyboard the angel fish
but i’m about to slow it down for you to understand
i’m on top i came from nothing to prepare something restaurant style
judge jury and execution
one the mic i grace it’s relevance on a plateau of elegance
i want my message carried out the speaker box at a loud concert playing evanescence

chorus

end



chorus song 3





you can’t beat me i keep a hammer in my palm like king dede
rocking out taking it back to baggy clothes enyce
i’m close by no long distance so my friends can reach me
all real in the battlefield you see my scars there’s no fakin
big jim a masterful rhymed in the makin
was
i love my life so i would never commit suicide
in the skin i’m in i love it so i would admit genocide
with the pen strokes it provides me from a gift from god
i know today the world is going crazy like the eighties babies
i’m hooked on phonics not chronic an atheist in a church that’s ironic
everything i spit in the main source becomes catatonic
did you know i had crack in my genes before i was thought of like reganomics
sir at the end of bank notes i want a couple zeros
cause i’m the game of life you going to need money to be a hero
let me hit you up luigi as i ride my mushroom
i hired gourmet chefs to cook five star dinners
i take my lovely lady on a shopping
spree you what i mean
big jim the marvelous musical rhyme enchanter mutiny haters that produced negative banter
i’m not crooked like a deer antler but i see my farm on my continent call me black panther
my ex i could not understand her and my rights reprimanded on my aisle stranded
the present is a must my past is not my debt i trust

chorus


v2

money fluctuates on point with a line my exclamation point floats and punctuates
i’m doing straight whether in i’m rich in stormy weather or in sunny skies in section 8
let the beat enervate marinate and elevate my mood
be careful for what you wish for cause you know it could be true
mowing my errors away when i fester my position
this delicate blend of sentimental tunes logging out
mind boggling questions being asked all the time on my side
i’m a crime solver and the world is my revolver
let me sign your book cause i’m your favorite author
drug free school zone i keep it clean no habits
mellow out a yellow skin fellow on a cello playing his soul out
i’m about to swarm in rounding up a thousand submissive mormons and make conversation that’s important
give me the loot i have a million genius ideas that will pay for more rent
i don’t know where i’m going but i know where i’m heading
you kids is always into something you have no business meddling
i keep quiet but you keep on stressing me and telling

chorus

v3

god can’t give me nothing thing i can’t manage
i’m pristine in a real form so i can appear and not vanish
i’m using all these dealings and weak links around me to my advantage
the master is here raw and potent one hand under my chin like i’m rodin
few made it out the war but got scars to prove they faced battles
moving around me like some roman chatter and cattle
distorted view points on various nefarious topics and signs of aquarius nights
take this back to when i would have riled my kingdom king darius rights
my stunt double ready to get in sync for the action about to occur
en vogue my robe ripped sargent i went rogue the shoes on my feet brogue
monopoly man hand out i’m broke but classically trained baroque
i got my flow from my pops and smile from my moms thanks for old folks
into this for a limited time only big jim praying for a shot in the game without being holy
totally submerged in immense curtains of detailed descriptions of immense success
electrified studio sessions expected the worst when you brought me the best
the master is here ending careers and wishing for better day as i wipe tears

chorus 2x
ahah

late to class

chorus

i keep my eye on the prize
my eyes set on the goal to acquire gold
they put my hopes on the shelf when it came to pass
they wonder i why i’m always late to class

3x

v1

i’m paid attention but could not afford the tuition
teachers raised eyebrows and concerns for my suspicions
i knew what i wanted but didn’t know how to get it
you see i already laugh at the bs in the system
it sickens me we all to endure this life when it tears ya apart
the teachers all get paid regardless but they say go to college its the key
well if it’s the key why i ain’t i found the door to unlock it yet
in the back room listening to instrumentals from lord finesse and the large professors
wondering if there is a heaven for a g after all like pac said
but i’m alive not said i’m a legend in the making big jim
when you know more than they know they hate you for it
i’m trying to be an admired president residing in front of my residence
dancing down the dismal streets full of characters and iridescent lights
i capture these factors from actors that get divided up like bone fractures
let me forklift my rhymes with practice
echoing my voice i’m a civil rights activist
leave you amazed distraught and tactless

chorus

v2
drugs and drinks i can’t do they leave you paralyzed and wrapped up like a hindu
on the menu i’m drinking wines in italy on exquisite venues
i continue to show hospitality in the hospital cheering up my peers faces
let me spit a genius bar for the ages
turn the pages work with animals out of cages
forming an award winning long tempering movie to be played
don’t shame me cause i’m young i’m stunned
wait up cause i’m tuned out and bored with the subject
where’s the substance in these metaphorical and simile lyrics
i’m striking numerous thoughts on various charts
look at my cart inside my art
i’m smart cause i know laughter is the music of the heart
i dine in nice food spots dealing with loan sharks
i got dreams like the other students in my class
but i know to make it you can’t fake it
in the fall moneys comes time to rake in

chorus

v3

alright so my path has some road blocks
thought i was the shit in the wrong spot
diamonds rubies sapphire and emerald 
but i’m just a way from being ephemeral
the hell with you when i tell you i’m reasonable
no more patience in this american dream i see it’s a scheme waist george carlin said
i’m well read i should have been a novelist
instead i made my meal putting sauce on my noodles
the waitress asked me what do i want i said the usual
ok that would me a pinch of stupid ignorant fools equipped with issues that are miserable
damon you got it down on point sounds reasonable
father time passes by my notes are full of splendid spliced up limericks
go ahead shoot your shot i’ll let you get one come to the court home of the new york knicks
take your pick your such a good prospect and a sport when channel your hobby
this ain’t world star instagram face book clad tv or anything of that nature
i been naughty before they had all then features
so you can why i’m not into go to class cause it’s just boring listening to the teachers

chorus 2x  i see the fire in your storm jim whirlpool rapper


chorus

yo jim yo jim i see it in your face 
you already know i’m thinking forbes 500 ceo my future face


v1

i want to be on forbes 500 making hits with the best from that list
my topic is of no more fervent discussion unless my insurance is background percussion
i’m in that top five even if i’m not alive
yeah this my be a problem so i are a turn left if o don’t feel right
like bananas when they peel back i do the same to mics
coming to grasp from a break in reality
the mind of an aspie god blessed me
big jim looking at the time on my smart watch the band a thousand dollars alone black and white like i’m one of the watchmen rorschach
i seen too many babbling traveling clothes unraveling whores on my block
they didn’t have a plan standing next to pimps who did a plethora of bids
i want to be a winner in life so i create my own path
i can picture me i a skinny slim fit suit wearing some argyle socks
big jim your so dapper they madder than the hatter go see lewis carroll
my beliefs are invested others so my karma is sown figuratively
tired of being decked in by this trickery
wicked wizardry casted upon me from my the depths of hades instantly
cause god wanted to make sure i gave back so i wouldn’t be greedy

chorus

v2

believe me we get a lot but we don’t cherish it just get embarrassed quick
fancy dinners politicking around candlelight’s showing i can handle types
i won’t let you haters and naysayers dismantle fights for justice 
when i bust this i must not be up for sell like auctioneer
exhausted when the spotlight is one for this production of flare
great game coach but i’m going to set this one out
why player i said because that’s not the play i’m aboutno doubt
slipping into something comfortable before the music turns on
my bank account just deposited money i see my flow like the egg yolk sunny
just took my woman out for a pedicure and a manicure
and i’m buying myself a ranch house augmenting a tennis court
i feel like i’ve been here before 
maybe i wast in a past life i don’t know for sure
about to carve my name james on a reservation where the indians be at
so i can buy it out give to them and watch their chief relapse
after my talent show coming to the booth to bring more dough

chorus


v3

steve martin will smith bill gates warren buffet
i’m trying to make those lyrical numerical digits no errors in my flow when my account stuffs it
you see my vision is envision with wits delivery and pension
cause i made the cut like try outs so go get him a band aid
this is from my brain and yes it is man made
counting down the number line so i’m going to have to shine on a ski resort alpine
your in for a treat i’m bringing the cake back
all the elites at the round table getting money and wisdom for a change
pull up out front see i’m the ultimate renaissance man
i cut bars using my own pen as a knife before i wed my wife i learned to prep bars my instructions come from the book of life
yeah it might be shady how i go from big to slim but i’m still me big jim flowing like rakim
i got a taste of the rich and famous i’m ready for the vegas nights at the mirage
morning breakfasts all you can eat let them serve us
my purpose is to get in not thrown out like a piece of junk
so i place all my money on this horse race 
damn if i win it all i want to be the number one out five hundred on fortune forbes 500 page damnnnn

chorus

chorus 6

i’m a prudent student a talent scouted out for his youth
every time i enter the room my force becomes centrifugal
the love of my life i’m being quite difficult
a life long learner i’m a scholar of this game we call life 

v1

put my phone number in your phone let me know
i’m a soaring super intellectual like a graduated from harvard in boston
top it off in the cake baby your iced frosting
get the game in order upscale dishes parallel with french or derives
more or less i want it all i’m hungry for success like i’m winnie the pooh
my journey is a disorder so i stay in my groove
rules of the game don’t snitch and turn on your family 
unless the price is right i’m bob barker
enlighten by the juice in this firewater
the working man is the real hustler
a bronx tale in the new 247 hustler
people change just as the leaves on the trees
i can make your bars soft chocolate chips or make them hard like the attitude on eve
i’m plugged into the game same as a woman’s hair piece
let the bass hit you from the front and the back
going to see my doctor he’s loco nick name him quack
munching on the meals and punching the clock even if i did not have skills

chorus

v2

i’m staying my lane when i ride fast and i’m staying focus
my worst work is better than your best opus
thing one or thing two
we’re always together our covalent bond nice
put you onto new game so left my old valence
i’m down in the dumps hopefully someone gives me s face lift
high up on my side you see the four letter word nasa on my space ship
currently my currency is in a current sea looking at my re occurring dream
try to beat me delete me cheat me
while your girls was a fiend for me i was their tutor boy meets world i’m mr feeny
i’m like them larger than life so they can cover the bases never tiny
oh my i’m an urban legend i’m may be related to ti
tighter than an african braid special ed i got it made velvet suede looser than paper machete
different looks with different crooks off the books our mob deep i’m not shook
survival of the fittest and my idols become rivals amongst the wittiest

chorus

v3

open a new book i’m onto the next chapter
a lot of heartache and laughters
after this service they going to call me baby obama mixed up next to a sunday pastor
put some oil on my anointed forehead so i get rid of the wrinkles lines
i’m a skate of old amber stone frozen in time
dust off the pet dander and spit poetical flows just like michelle alexander
luckily i’m on my seventh line by designed saved in heaven on my eleventh rhyme
i can’t body anybody and stand the test of time
please stay over there and don’t acknowledge me
swallow your pride and be a gentleman like styles p
snake eyes roll one up the pass it out were beyond a pair of dice
the world is a small place inside swimming around fish inside a clear vase
they never grow up they still a bunch of school children
on this ship i’m a voyeur adventures like tom sawyer
or do you want a neurotic lawyer before you leave your last employer
next inauguration i’m running up for rejection so pave the way for my new direction

chorus

seven song

chorus trade spaces

officer of the law these rules are not in my hands
around the globe i see many aging faces and people i recognize not being nameless
far from being rich and famous
now it’s time for changing and trading spaces

v1

we got pulled over i’m not into drugs or drinking i’m still sober
never ever bought a range rover i’m still a fall baby call me red october
when the shoe is in the other foot they treat you another way
no mans an island i’m captivated by the red white and blue siren
maybe i should be on the ringling bros who knows
i stay with a basket full of school supplies
i’m making my own recipe to search for my own destiny my offspring take my legacy and take home a new dynasty
could have been a common pusher except i make good music
instead i went to college and reinvented my avatar
my name is james that’s the title of my first cd
if your mouth is dry get something to drink from geysers and water springs i know your thirsty
the hospital made me sick quick this cat ain’t slick
yo break it down so i can get my fix
i’m on everyone’s track they featuring me on their remix
take your pick cause i roll up with all types of cliques
my flare shoots up so gamble now take your pick

v2

tomorrow is not promised so be thankful for your specific gift
i know you ain’t a killer here’s the bullets you purposely dropped
i unfold my on my desktop at my kids rehearsal
want the glove to spin my picture is universal 
let me stick my hand out in a street fight call me vega
and don’t forget the meds come get three omegas please
it’s a shame that i got a go through all this just to get a check
on the land of the blind ombré one eye man is king
let the pharaohs come you hear the symphony playing when they sing
due me a favor before you sue me or shoot me make sure first you introduce me
play the hand your dealt switch up when get a second
i learned from my oppression this estranged aggression in my way no mind suppression
i need rehab and motivation for my the gentle sonnets i engrave
i don’t need to push hard i’m in deep water donkey kong strength i’m enguarde on guard
look hard in my tracks my footprints misrepresent the sketchy road i walked
no lead detective change this channel before you see my next episode

chorus


v3
praying for more wisdom then fools that bear gold
why cause it’s scary when you commence to climb the totem pole
fold them roles and hold them up slow
i’m far ahead of my time living in maui on a beach looking at nice seniorita
put a toothpick in her hair from the brew i drunk
it’s all a mad rat trap my whole life flashes before me i’m in this quarry
bounded and confounded in forestry me weed comes from another galaxy
surrounded in ounces of love by the pound you see my aura
i’m dizzy from all the drama i need to get some insight from my mama
i laugh at you cats im cheshire
on the bike i’m leaving a car crash found in cigar ash and i can’t help i played it well see n road rash
time goes by fast i slow the metronome on the telephone
i admit it i’m vulgar i could produce an ulcer
this scene is hilarious bride of chucky i won’t marry ya
represent my lyrical sensation i’m on the avenue of restoration
a bridge of life i cross it to make my angelic destination

chorus 2x

song 8

chorus

this is a chess game against checker players
a humble knight prepares to be a dragon slayer
my god i put my good foot down like james brown
idiots not thinking their next move so i rearrange my angles through

v1

i’m on a business trip bright lights and expensive chicks
listening to hov wearing a 3 pc suit watching boxin flicks
am i me at all times i do think so
a couple mill from a couple pickles when i eat my deal
chill back on my beige recliner reruns on the television of hotel rwanda
jealousy only makes me want to step my game up
krs one approach when you step into my world
big jim similar to a third world regime from here to beijing
i’m always an extreme case cause i can go from sociopathic to holographic
count my money where’s mos def someone drop some mathematics
i carry all this worry on my shouldered outside lookers see the atlas
i’m pragmatic generous giving to poor people is automatic
how you going to help me when in go platinum
when you have no arms trying to shoot me with your magnum
like the government royalties coming in i have to tax them
let my kinfolk relax then a pair of aces i’m out kid

chorus

v2

i’m in my green one door speed boat
you cracked me up using some old jokes
potpourris blend in the misty swift delicate breeze
intoxicating smells make me chilled and drop to my knees
i pray to jesus cause he saved from a lot of misery
come close or slice us in half my other fits perfectly see the symmetry
a wild defense mechanism utilizing mimicry
open up the bible reading scriptures turning sorrows to triumphs
i’ve been here to clarify my past lines to identify complex rhymes
you know i what all the green clean and fresh call me st ives
even saints fall short of the grace and glory of god in they lives
make the most of your darken troubles and your problems have roots alex haley
i love cougars to sear their is no court case kevin spacey
isolate me in a cell and determine my outcome
i keep my ex close by she’s vicious fighter like malcolm
moves have to be made modestly at any given cost

chorus

v3

if crime pays bills i simply take rain checks
its a no brainer my rhyme skills hit hard and sprain necks
i can’t believe i tried to trade my essence for a new beginning
loser or win i’m making up my mind now i’m in the dressing room stage one act 4
good morning ladies i’m up nice and early
god is always god we a tag yeah duo like laverne and shirley
this game is bungled up see my hair it’s real curly
big jim come to the fifth floor to speak to your big brother
out the window i saw a droid airborne in the sky
they wonder why dislike the government in our issues
here you go my darling take this plain tissue
don’t mind that curvy body i had to jog pass you
an imbalance in my head not drinking more booze
swear to take the chess piece i plant it on the queen
she can go all over if you know what i mean
figuring out this plot and gathering up my clues feeling blue

song 9

chorus

i’m not up to it today faxing all this illness in world gone astray
let me my heart out like a cig on an ashtray
coming for me your too late to save me from my fate
i changed courses to seek help cause i’m not in the mood today

v1

my brain hurts my heart hurts
thoughts written down have slight aneurisms
audience applauded me for exhibiting decent vocal mannerisms
my family mourns a relatives passing while celebrating a birth of an organism 
sanity is lost and stability is found
gather up all my utensils so i create my own david of pieta
when i’m on tv one day ill cheer you up in spain doing a fiesta
at the moment i’m heartbroken sending my condolences to all the victims
seems to me rap is no longer an art form well im here to restore it back to its form
mccob and morose attitudes over a table conversation time to make a toast
never put butter on it it might clog your arteries so pardon me
big jim in the limelight again resurrecting
the dead
redeeming my soul before my face becomes red
the alleyway i see my best friend tommy shoot craps
911 came around 12 shot some bullets the neighborhood just snap
i see my old buddy breathing hard taking his last nap

chorus

v2

life is too short for long melodies and fierce tragedies
go ahead send some shade my glasses on before i fade
out in the front yard where the dogs bark in a rage
and i’m here for the same reason you are mate
i want success money cars clothes women and the power
but today i can’t run from own ways i see it about to pour depression
some days are better than others i will benefit
some people try to get better and others change on you like clark kent
notoriously known a for having a silver tongue flow
hip hop music poisons the minds of youth ruthlessly
it’s not even close or can fathom from where it used to be
time to unwind from the family grind put some classic as i’m in my lair
say a prayer while i’m in my rocking chair
for the mayor
i dare anyone to stop there unwrapping my pink cold eclair
the engine transmission is rumbling in to the atmosphere sending high vibrations
this is one of those days to me big jim living in his prison of manipulation

chorus

v3

i could have been a servant for you but lied
i don’t want to sell my freedom for coins
i rather die a man than live a coward
my bars bring hope back to life like a jesus
i need you dear more than forever now
by the way it amazes me on your hardest days you still be positive
let me thrown on one of my evergreen brims
some love the pain others watch with grief
i keep all the extra official documents locked in my case to keep it brief
i’m not even shocked or in disbelief
one day i will attain status in an apparatus being lavish in a tan jeep
keep it simple i believe it’s in you
a sad disposition the frown gesture
i’m up at night kicking your butt carmen electra
we have to keep it balance like your doing problems in algebra
i’m not in the mood today so so if you kill me my outer shell will blow up galaga


song 10

chorus

if you don’t use the you lose it
don’t come here if you going to abuse it
my gift from good is priceless so i duel it
tomorrow ain’t promised so why you up for stupid

v1

yo i sweat profusely looking around hearing clandestine rumors
vacuuming up pieces of exploded parts from new caprices
big jim the i want to put my name on a vermillion plaque
let me extend a handshake my only wish is my first hit to earthquake and ground break
immoral actions only get you described as arrested
tested my character because i know it counts
my eyes see green dollar signs inside of loaded amounts
not into drugs never even had to scale or toted an ounce
bubbling on the stove it must be some country bacon
the smell woke up me out a nightmare
i was drowning in my own conscious feeling guilty and pitiful
of how i was living with the people i was around les miserables
in my lab yearning for more ingenuity
building you up beautifully a class act leaving out some promiscuity
i keep an eye on my money like mall security
pin point my location this master is ardent in his versatile acuity

chorus

v2

laser scenes in the sky i see quasars pulsars and ray beams
a star fell out the sky and landed on its zone
i can hear you on through the grape vine on my headphone
if i dudes wanna see my reputation in shambles let them attempt
but if they go amiss this will be the last time they give their kids a goodnight kiss
i’m out for me in life a vandal a rogue a wild west desperado
you ain’t a man yet you still a boy on the strings of gepetto
i’m so blind to your tricks this that they make mad
hello to the new artists who want to throw away their ideas
put it all together supercontinent from pangea
then their sugar levels spike out their pancreas
don’t be upset you will thank me for this
put on you big wig and get emotional like madea
lose yourself for the moment then zoom out and then save it soon
i heard my aunt the infirmary abs shewon’t make through
a coupe of steps back i see the bigger moral point
now or never it’s your choice how do you deploy

chorus

v2

miracles are just spouted out in my walk with christ
a higher power gives me his blessings as
act nice
in the front i stand to eat so i get no back bites
big jim gonna put it on like big l did
i stay underwater with spongebob catching delicious squid
hit you on the radio and then turn my doorknob
i punch beats and put fruit in my glass
the goal was to get a bout a million in lyrical imperialism to get the finest denim’s
i’m on a great hunt i’ll be back in 8 months
i may show to the emmy’s on intergalactic trunk
you want to pay homage i’ll make you vomit
a plus report i’m long so i can’t be short
in school i was deemed a dork but know i do me kick ass like bloodsport
off the road i race dramatically
actually i’m strategizing to get wealthier and by me a yellow pit bull terrier
i’m taking off from the weed i seen an airplane carrier

chorus

v3

more the merrier sharing is caring 
i had enough of rappers talk about sex and bling
instead i leave a quite when i sing
no one can do everything but everyone can do something
brash reactions when get no cash advances
damn the devil on my level wins and parleys again
feed my ego to this noticeable sequel
i can’t help she gonna tell it
wrap it up in a sub sandwich 
her beauty mark is adorable
our president present behavior is deplorable
low income to heavily rich is crazy 
women in the mirror she looks too hazy
breaking demons around me so i can tread
out the oven let gather my fajitas to enjoy
moving slow some amoebas and retarded divas
near the vault open it up safe wait my fault on my occult you ain’t going on pause

chorus

v3

trepidation over the use of words exaggeration
i’m going to stellar stepping to new heights
grazing the fields and gazing the sights
grading my paperwork kind of busy thinking about life bug off jerk
hustle hard and smart keep your circle small
grab my rock so i feel i’m walking tall
small talkers get mauled and get one of my dogs huge paws
i’m a bourgeoise threat fucking up the set like nathan
hi i can’t seem to cool down
making fun of me ahaha are you clowns
i’m at the club having a great time just being in the moment
the toll needs to be paid that’s a large price to pay
bypass dying people on the side of the street uttering getting shunned and suffering
i black and white i’m your living domino
we pull out raps like when your tonsils gone
this is my last creation the reaper came to dredge my life
