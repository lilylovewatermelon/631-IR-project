the new years getting older the february roses are withered away
the sun keeps getting closer sinking a little slower everyday
ooh its getting louder at the lights music clashing in the street
moon shining on the parking lot dolls
tanned legs in the nights sliding out of the seat
stilettos at the crosswalk

prechorus 1
i graduated but every year in may i get that schools out feeling
i feel it creeping in
every days a weekend and im drowning in the freedom

chorus
blame it on the bikinis party girls and martinis and the sunshine
the private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
i know in september im gon remember how much i loved her
im single for the suhuhuh single for the summer

verse 2
ive gone off the deep end company im keeping is messing me up
the good girls at home sleeping while im out creeping til the sun comes up
ooh i’ve got my phone faced down and my hair combed back riding round getting good at the game
saying the wrong things right chasing midtown girls holding hands and forgetting their names

prechorus 2
i graduated but every year in may i get that schools out feeling
dont wanna leave here but damn it im not a cheater and i cant help leaving
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
blame it on the bikinis party girls and martinis and the sunshine
the private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
i know in september im gon remember how much i love her
im single for the suhuhuh single for the summer

bridge
all of these pretty young things pretty young things
can make you forget a goodbyes sad
try to make a good guy bad

chorus
blame it on the bikinis party girls and martinis and the sunshine
the private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
i know in september im gon remember how much i love her
im single for the suhuhuh single for the summer
im single for the suhuhuh single for the summer

outro
why do i love all of these city girls
why do i love all of these city girls
why do i love all of these city girls with pretty eyes
down on demonbreun and broken hearted rich girls the debutantes the small town runaways
all dolled up at the bar with debit cards they don’t know how pretty they are
city girls city girls15embed"
