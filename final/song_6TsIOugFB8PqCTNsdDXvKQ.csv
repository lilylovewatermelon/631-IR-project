remember the girl
abused with forks knives and razorblades
remember the girl
abused with forks knives and razorblades

verse 1
she finally left him she had enough of her mans rage
bandaids cover her scars she left him bloodied
beat his ass with a bat face sunk like silly putty
you all can sit back so i can study
destruction of the family design
and how the morals of society decline
essentially is beats to rhymes like grapes to wine

chorus
its alright were in love
cant live with or without

verse 2
you see she cant live with him and cant live without him
stress got her down she needs to deal with her problems
while the drama gets deeper i put on the reefer
she took the last step and sent his ass to the reaper
chaos is what she saw in the mirror
scared of herself and the power that was in her
it took over and weighed heavily on her shoulders
militant insanity is now what controlled her

verse 3
kill it before it reaches you
missiles wont its approaching the mainland
what if it reaches the metropolitan areas cosmopolitan areas
secure the lines and prepare for departure calm calm calm
it is a a big business and seems to be advancing underground
because my style is underground im green with my red eyes mad tint
flee fly flow rapido rapido
she feeds plentiful electrifying the nation electrifying the nation

verse 4
dont you see that we are in danger
how will we stop it
she is attacking
dont you see that we are in danger
how will we stop it
she is attacking
