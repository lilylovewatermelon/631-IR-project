it aint a problem til i say it is
handle my problem thats the way it is
always talkin like a bitch but thats the way he is
after the ride nobodyll know where he is triple cs

verse 1 rick ross
when you serve a cat a couple of times
knowin he serve in a couple of towns
polaco pensacola down to duval
it put you in the mind of a pimp like too hort
classy nigga walkin around with stacks
but im gettin word that he talkin behind my back
now is the time to listen you gotta pay attention
he may pay a henchman put him up on where you livin
tell him all your cars makes and models
tell him how you on steaks and bottles
opium sunday oxygen tuesday
how you go to the boxin gym tryna lose weight
he done told a nigga all your routes
and now you got a lowlife tryna figure you out
catch you in the driveway trigger you out
thats what killers about thats what niggas allow remember

chorus gunplay
it aint a problem til i say it is
handle my problem thats the way it is
always talkin like a bitch but thats the way he is
after the ride nobodyll know where he is triple cs

nigga please you aint a cap peeler
save that ease for your bathroom mirror
no platoon dealer you niggas baboons
half gorilla a camp of scrillers
triple c stamp the trillest
i got bs imma spend it i dont care what the bill is
them hoes stay at the billets
and when they ask what year i tell em two thousand two minute
a rider without a motive you got it right im a solider
long as its loaded imma tote it
i told ya flow so cold below frozen
like ice water over the pro tools
but thats old news update the topic
what makes the prophet cut cake in projects
imma show him how cupcake his squad is
duct tape embalmers for makin them comments

chorus gunplay
it aint a problem til i say it is
handle my problem thats the way it is
always talkin like a bitch but thats the way he is
after the ride nobodyll know where he is triple cs

verse 3 torch

chains and the flat screen shawty that llac mean
meaning its comin too nigga what you wanna do
i send g to kill you lay your daddy down in front of you nigga
chorus gunplay

always talkin like a bitch but thats the way he is
after the ride nobodyll know where he is triple cs
