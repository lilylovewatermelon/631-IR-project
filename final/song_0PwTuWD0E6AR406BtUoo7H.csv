there are days when shes a whisper
nights when shes a scream
a reason to wake up in the morning
to close your eyes and dream
shell curse you like a sailor
shell wound you with her eyes
she always makes it better
but she wont apologize

bridge
i know everything about her but dont know her at all

chorus
shes a ride on a mystery train
to a place youve never been before
better hold on tight to that mystery train
youre not in kansas anymore
shes a ride
mystery train

verse 2
she cries because shes happy
she sings songs when shes mad
like a stiff drink when you need it
shes good at being bad
and long before you knew her you knew she was the one
