bessie was a lovely child from west tennessee
leroy was an outlaw wild as a mink
one day she saw him starin and it chilled her to the bone
and she knew she had to see that look on a child of her own

chorus
cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
and outlaws touch the ladies
somewhere deep down in their soul

verse 2
linda was a lady blonde and built to last
benny was a no good guitar picker runnin from his past
she heard all of his songs tellin nothin but bad news
but she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose

chorus
ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
and outlaws touch the ladies
somewhere deep down in their soul

verse 3
jessi like the cadillacs and diamonds on her hands
waymore had a reputation as a ladies man
late one night a light of love finally gave a sign
jessi parked her cadillac and took her place in line
