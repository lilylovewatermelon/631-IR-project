wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay

verse 1 serj tankian
my horse is a shackled old man
his his remorse was that he couldnt survey
the skies right before right before they went grey
my horse and my remorse flying over a great bay

chorus serj tankian
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay

verse 2 serj tankian
my source is the source of all creation
her discourse is that we all dont survey
the skies right before right before they go grey
my source and my remorse flying over a great bay

chorus serj tankian
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
one that smiled when he flew over the bay
