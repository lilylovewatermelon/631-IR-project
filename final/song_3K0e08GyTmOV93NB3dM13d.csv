stems and gears oh how the daisies bloom
when chandeliers light up the engine room
can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
theres an underwater ferris wheel
where i found the missing link to this island chain

chorus
home will always be here unseen out of sight
where i disappear and hide
i think dreamy things as im waving goodbye
so ill spread out my wings and fly
home is a boxcar and its so far out of reach
hidden under umbrella beach

instrumental interlude

chorus
home will always be here unseen out of sight
where i disappear and hide
i think dreamy things as im waving goodbye
so ill spread out my wings and fly
home is a boxcar and its so far out of reach
