im meetin my buddies out on the lake
were headed out to a special place we love
that just a few folks know
theres no signin up no monthly dues
take your johnson your mercury
or your evinrude an fire it up
meet us out at party cove
come on in the waters fine
just idle on over an toss us a line

hook
basstrackers bayliners and a party barge
strung together like a floatin trailer park
anchored out and gettin loud all summer long
side by side theres five houseboat front porches
astroturf lawn chairs and tiki torches
regular joes rockin the boat thats us
the redneck yacht club

verse 2
bermudas flipflops and a tanktop tan
he popped his first top at 10 am thats bob
hes our president
were checkin out the girls on the upper deck
rubbin in the 15 spf its hot
everybodys jumpin in
later on when the sun goes down
well pull out the jar and that old guitar
an pass em around
