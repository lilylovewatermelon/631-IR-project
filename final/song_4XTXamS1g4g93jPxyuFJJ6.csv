this here is on some truthful shit
it seems like everything i do youre used to it
and i hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
thats when i gotta hide what im feeling inside
so you still think im confident and damn
is this gonna last
youre up on a pedestal are we moving too fast
feel like im in crazy competition with the past
thats why i gotta ask

chorus

brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
is anything im doin brand new
is anything im doin brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
oh girl ayy ayy ayy

verse 2
this here is something personal
i highly doubt this feeling is reversible
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
so i dont ever question you and damn
i cant even find the perfect brush
so i can paint whats going through my mind
racing against myself but im a couple steps behind
thats why i gotta ask
