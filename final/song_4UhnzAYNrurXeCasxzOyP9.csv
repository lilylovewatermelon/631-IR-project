when your head is spinning round
when everything is upside down
you can look at things differently
come and check my galaxy

prechorus 1
youll be claiming stars now baby
ill be representing clouds
but before you get too far out baby
before you start looking down

chorus
let me show you the way how
let me hold you high

your feet are safely on the ground
im staring off into your space
youre only coming through in waves right now but
