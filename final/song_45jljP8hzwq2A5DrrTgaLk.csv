verse 1 charlie scene  funny man
i love it when the dj throws my song on
hit the dance floor and get my singalong on
i love to spit the choruses when im on one
my cwalks too hot i done ripped my sean john
smelling so fly i got the hugo boss on
you got the type of booty id like to put my paws on
we could roll in the fiesta just to get our floss on
i got the speakers bumping straight banging the thong song
got my hair did got my shit braided up
rolling with funny man and hes breaking a blunt
snatch it out of his hand and now im blazing it up
took another sip of henny now im faded as fuck
yo charlie scene tell me where you got them shades at
you know ive had this og style since way back
sitting in vip blowing trees im laid back
this bitch is gonna be another notch on my wave cap

hold up and let me lace up the timbs
im only 26 but so is the rims
i wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis
i look so good a million bucks is jealous
so i parked the huffy kicked down the kickstand
paid twentydollar cover and i got me a wristband
got bitches to my neck like im standing in quicksand
if they talk to me twice they better talk to my pimp hand
got the laker jersey and the platinum chain
two bluetooths and a pinkie ring
getting drunk as fuck off that tanqueray
beer goggles on im talking to a grenade
yo charlie scene tell me how you got so flossy
it isnt my fault that all the ladies want me
i just roll with the posse whos cool like fonzie
and known to be flashier than paparazzi

im about to get it cracking and freakydeaky
all the ladies in the world just dying to meet me
cause nothing about me is ever cheesy
ill get you in the bed and make it squeaky squeaky
looking so damn fly as i hit the club
low ride west side yes we throwing it up
make my way to the dance floor to burn it up
now go ahead and hit that chorus and turn it up
