the summer days are gone too soon
you shoot the moon and miss completely
and now youre left to face the gloom
the empty room that once smelled sweetly

chorus 1
of all the flowers you plucked if only
you knew the reason
why you had to each be lonely
was it just the season

verse 2
and now the fall is here again
you cant begin to give in its all over
when the snows come rolling through
youre rolling too with some new lover

chorus 2
will you think of times you told me
that you knew the reason
why we had to each be lonely
it was just the season

that you knew the reason
why we had to each be lonely
