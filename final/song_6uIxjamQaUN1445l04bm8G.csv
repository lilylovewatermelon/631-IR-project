from my tape deck theres a recklessness
inflections of the world we want
all my friends my rusty truck
were just specks of love directionless
call this band just what we want
we can change the name from month to month
four guitars and zero drums
we sounded folk but we wanted to be punk
in a world postpunk

verse 2
well my friend had an old guitar
he took some lessons didnt get very far
an ibanez with one knob stuck
said you can have that thing for fifty bucks
laura got a bass but it got no amp
borrowed skills but never gave it back
luke is just learning how to strum
but since he was the worst we made him play the drums
play the drums

chorus
you may find in the palm of your hand theres a flame
as it burns as it climbs as it turns to a blaze
well this flame it wont last here it comes hold it close
cause this blaze can be fast set it free now there it goes
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeverse 3
lukes mom said that after school
we could rehearse in the living room
but that sure didnt last too long
guess she didnt know wed play fugazi songs
we played these songs in the talent show
and all of the girls would be in the front row
but in the end we just chickened out
cause we cant sing we can only shout
only shhh

chorus
you may find in the palm of your hand theres a flame
as it burns as it climbs as it turns to a blaze
well this flame it wont last here it comes hold it close
well this blaze can be fast set it free now there it goes2embed"
