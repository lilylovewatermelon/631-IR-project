i would paint my reverie
if thats the only way for you to be with me

wed be there together
just like we used to be
underneath the swirling skies for all to see

and im dreaming of a place
where i could see your face
and i think my brush would take me there
but only

if i were a painter
and could paint a memory
id climb inside the swirling skies to be
with you
id climb inside the skies to be with yousee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also like2embed"
