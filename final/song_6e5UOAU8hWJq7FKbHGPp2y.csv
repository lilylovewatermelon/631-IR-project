funny when i think about the months that i could not get out of bed
going back and forth over the letters that i wrote but never sent
wake up and repeat it but i was barely sleeping
swimming in the memories im floating in the deep end
how come youre not still in my head

chorus
i got you got we got too much time on our hands
used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
im not chasing feelings that i dont understand
im underwater but im over you

verse 2
thought that id be good the day i took down all your pictures in my room
howd it go from easier to everythings still leading back to you
can i be honest i think about you constantly
youre closing every door but now im looking for an opening
maybe im just getting confused

chorus
i got you got we got too much time on our hands
used to be so caught up in the things we had planned
im still chasing feelings that i dont understand
im underwater am i over youyou might also like6embed"
