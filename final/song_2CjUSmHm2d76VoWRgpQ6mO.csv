your voice is adrift
i cant expect it to sing to me
as if i was the only one

chorus
ill follow you
the leaf thats following the sun
when will my weight be too much for you
when will these ideas really be my own
because this moment keeps on moving
we were never meant to hold on

verse 2
this was a scene worth waking up for
when i woke up
you planted me in my own pot
dont know why
but somehow it just feels so wrong

when youre sad i will be lonely
but when you rise again ill have become the sun
i will shine down upon you
as if you were the only one

your voice is your own i cant protect it
youll have to sing
a verse no one has ever known
dont be afraid
cause no one ever sings alone

your weight will never be too much for me
your ideas have always been your own
and this moment keeps on moving
we were never meant to hold onembed"
