no no no

verse 1 blackbear
take a little bit of this girl
i will show you what im on
its not the beginning of something unwritten
it feels like were living too fast to fall asleep
take a little hit of this girl
i will show you the world tonight
and i promise

chorus blackbear
that this could be everything you needed
this could be everything you dreamed of
and i wont waste a minute of time that were livin
i wont waste a day less im wasting my days with you
i wont waste a day less im wasting my days with you
i wont waste away less im wasting away with you
yeah oh yeah oh

verse 2 devon baldwin
yeah let it in let it be babe
this is everything you need baby
we have all this time to waste
i wont even make you wait so just come and lay with me
and i will show you how
i can show you now
take a hit and let it out
cause theres a method to my madness
all you needs a little practice
follow me baby you dont have to say a thing
keep your eyes closed we can live in a reverie
breathe just a little deeper
theres no better feeling than now
and i promise
