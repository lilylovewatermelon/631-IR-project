sometimes i get a little too hurt
got my mind goin places it aint wanna go
sometimes i get a little too low
and i cant see myself through the fire and smoke
and you like a neon light
shinin through a door that i cant keep closed
and you like a rolling stone
always buildin cities on the hearts that you broke

chorus
and in my head i did my very best saying goodbye goodbye
and i dont miss you but i think of you and dont know why
i still feel high
i still feel high

verse 2
sometimes i stay up all night
cause you dont ever talk to me in my dreams
and i think about eventually youre holdin me
and dancin to the record like a movie scene

chorus
and in my head i did my very best saying goodbye goodbye
and i dont miss you but i think of you and dont know why
i still feel high
i still feel high
