im not the same i used to be
i think for myself now
i dont need you in my ear
id love to hit you in the face
id love to know youve gone away
i dont wanna see you again
i hope you can understand me

get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
i dont understand why you think you
can do the things you cant

so get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
my piece of mind

youre so mad cause your losing control
you dont know which way is safe to go
everything is so fake
i dont know what else to say
youll see somehow some day
some way youll see believe me
you might also likeget out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
i dont understand why you think you
can do the things you cant

so get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
my piece of mind

get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head

get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
i dont understand why you think you
can do the things you cant

so get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
my piece of mind
get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head

bring me back my piece of mind

so get out of my face
get out of my sight
get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
my piece of mindembed"
