ive been patiently waiting tying my stomach in knots
ive been lost in the moment going to war with my thoughts
and if youre feeling the pressure the pressures all that i got
so if you think that youre ready im here to tell you youre not
the time is right now yeah youre in over your head
im calling lights out until its over and dead
and ill be damned if i ever let you get me again
yeah i will stop at nothing cause i was made to rise above it

prechorus brian burkheiser
oh
cause one of these days one of these days
everyone will know
but for now i stand alone

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
i count my enemies like trophies
i wear my scars so they can show me
now ive got nothing left to prove
so when i look at you all i see are trophies trophies
im not afraid
to put it all on the line like it runs in my veins
i will stop at nothing cause i was made to rise above it
yeah i was made to rise above it
i will stop at nothing cause i was made to

i dont want no handouts know i earned it earned it
remember shows when nobody came
well that pissed me off i stayed workin workin
locked inside of in my room
losin some sleep writin verses
they told me im nothin i heard em
they want me to fall off im laughin got records like nothin
i feel like a surgeon
yall went out on the weekend i make hits while you drinkin
turn a dream to a lifestyle six figures aint even peak yet
they hate me they want me to die
came up from nothin the numbers dont lie
you cannot stop me so dont even try
i rise above it owe this all to god yeah
