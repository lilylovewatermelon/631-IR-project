and now the sun is rising
another long walk back home back home
theres just so many faces
but no one i need to know need to know
in the dark i can fight it
i fake til im numb
but in the bright light
i taste you on my tongue

chorus
now the partys over
and everybodys gone
im left here with myself and i
wonder what went wrong
and now my heart is broken
like the bottles on the floor
does it really matter
or am i just hung over you

postchorus
ahahahah
ahahahah oh
or am i just hungover

verse 2
even my dirty laundry
everything just smells like you like you
and now my head is throbbing
every song is outta tune just like you
in the dark i can fight it
til it disappears
but in the daylight
i taste you in my tears
