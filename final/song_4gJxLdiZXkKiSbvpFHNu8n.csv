theres nothing i could say to you
nothing i could ever do to make you see
what you mean to me
all the pain the tears i cried
still you never said goodbye
and now i know how far youd go

prechorus
i know i let you down
but its not like that now
this time ill never let you go

chorus
i will be all that you want
and gather myself together
cause you keep me from falling apart
all my life ill be with you forever
to get you through the day
and make everything okay

verse 2
