long gone long gone
long gone long gone

verse 1 yung lumber
back on that fuckin dope smacked— smacked
im bout to make a toast
raise a glass to a room full of all my dead friends ghosts
they loudly shoutin poundin fists
yelling yo is this a joke
you vowed to quit—renounce the shit
bitch you tryna overdose
i i looked up and stared at a table with empty chairs
i aint able to move im scared this is fatal
aint prepared for my betrayals consequences
broke a promise and i get it im a failure im a fuck up
yet im unapologetic

chorus yung lumber
save me from this hell
let me rest in peace
save me from this hell
let me rest in peace another death shy
save me from this hell of living a long life
let me rest in peace raise your head up high
save me from this hell people said they ride
let me rest in peace dont forget to say goodbye
save me from this hell because when its your time
let me rest in peace its too late you cant rewind
save me from this hell we live only to die
let me rest in peace we live only to die

long gone gone
gone gone

verse 2 lick loth
i been long gone
look for the soul in my eyes and you see none
broken down to my last over my own blood
woke up on the worst side of the bed
and aint wanna get out ouch
i can only speak about the shit that im thinking bout
im worried bout my crippled mother and father
my mawmaw and her liver
lenny almost no longer livin

bridge lick loth
and lil brothers i cant even begin
better lives still not right im still wrong
got my will done im long gone—

chorus yung lumber
another death shy
save me from this hell of living a long life
let me rest in peace raise your head up high
save me from this hell people said they ride
let me rest in peace dont forget to say goodbye
save me from this hell because when its your time
let me rest in peace its too late you cant rewind
save me from this hell we live only to die
let me rest in peace we live only to die
outro yung lumber
save me from this hell
let me rest in peace19embed"
