you change your mind
like a girl changes clothes
yeah you pms
like a bitch i would know
and you overthink
always speak cryptically
i should know
that youre no good for me

chorus
cause youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down
youre wrong when its right
its black and its white
we fight we break up
we kiss we make up
you you dont really wanna stay no
you but you dont really wanna goo
youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down
you might also likeverse 2
we used to be
just like twins so in sync
the same energy
nows a dead battery
used to laugh used to laugh bout nothing bout nothing
now youre plain now youre plain boring boring
i should know i should know
that youre not gonna change

chorus
cause youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down
youre wrong when its right
its black and its white
we fight we break up
we kiss we make up
you you dont really wanna stay no oh
you but you dont really wanna goo oh
youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down down
bridge
someone call the doctor
got a case of a love bipolar
stuck on a roller coaster
cant get off this ride

break
you change your mind
like a girl changes clothes

chorus
cause youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down
youre wrong when its right
its black and its white
we fight we break up
we kiss we make up
youre hot then youre cold ohohoh
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down
youre wrong when its right ohohoh
its black and its white
we fight we break up
we kiss we make up
you you dont really wanna stay no oh
you but you dont really wanna goo oh
youre hot then youre cold
youre yes then youre no
youre in then youre out
youre up then youre down32embed"
