they come from every state to find
some dreams were meant to be declined
tell the man what did you have in mind
what have you come to do
no turning water into wine
no learning while youre in the line
ill take you to the broken sign
you see these lights are blue

bridge 1 anthony kiedis
come and get it lost it at the city limit
say goodbye cause they will find a way to trim it
everybody lookin for a silly gimmick
gotta get away cant take it for another minute

prechorus 1 anthony kiedis
this town is made of many things
just look at what the current brings
so high its only promising
this place was made on you

chorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
tell me baby whats your story
where you come from and where you wanna go this time aw
tell me lover are you lonely
the thing we need is never all that hard to find aw
tell me baby whats your story
where do you come from and where you wanna go this time aw
youre so lovely are you lonely
oh giving up on the innocence you left behind
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 anthony kiedis
some claim to have the fortitude
too shrewd to blow the interlude
sustaining pain to set a mood
step out to be renewed
ill move you like a baritone
jungle brothers on the microphone
getting over with an undertone
its time to turn to stone

bridge 2 anthony kiedis
chittychitty baby when your nose is in the nittygritty
life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty
what a pity boston and a kansas city
looking for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty

prechorus 2 anthony kiedis
three fingers in the honeycomb
you ring just like a xylophone
devoted to the chromosome
the day that you left home

chorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
tell me baby whats your story
where you come from and where you wanna go this time oh
tell me lover are you lonely
the thing we need is never all that hard to find oh
tell me baby whats your story
where you come from and where you wanna go this time oh
youre so lovely are you lonely
oh giving up on the innocence you left behind
behind
