when youre young not much matters
when you find something that you care about then thats all you got
when you go to sleep at night you dream of music
when you wake up its the same thing
its there in your face you cant escape it
sometimes when youre young
the only place to go is inside thats just it
music is what i love
take that away from me and i really got nothing
hahhah
this shit right here this feel like a million bucks
jerm make sure im coming through clear here
most dope what it is
ladies and gentlemen you are now in tune to kids uh

verse
motherfucker i feel like the hardest working kid in america
playing with the pros i remember being amateur
but now im rocking shows see the lights from the camera phones
see my people and they hands is up
yeah the game a girl trying to tease but dont plan to fuck
my older brother told me that im finally manning up cause
ive been a fuckup if you ask me
but im still praying that my teachers gon pass me
letters from my soul scriptures from the torah
only give you what you like im a station on pandora
rock a sag my girl tell me pull my shorts up
rock solid homie im built ford tough
sip a little lean smoke a little weed
we just trying to keep it cool so we blast the ac
some people hate we tell em its all gravy
yeah you got your team but im fighting with the navy
battle to the top
we in it to win it we wont stop
no more going to stores but dont cop shit
never go another day with empty pockets
houston you there we balling like the rockets
and now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
high honor roll but not thinking bout a college
love with these rhymes want the cover of time
man of the year got my image stuck in your mind
hold up one second
girl this my last l ima roll it up with you
cop some brand new shoes put me in a good mood
ima bring a couple homies you can call a couple friends
