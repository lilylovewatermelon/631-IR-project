youve been riding this horse a long time
why cant you find what youve been lookin for
always greener on the other side
always believin there must be something more

prechorus
never stay very long anywhere
as the next girl you leave gets smaller
in your rearview mirror

chorus
youre an outlaw youre an outlaw
youre an outlaw runnin from love
youre an outlaw youre an outlaw
youre an outlaw runnin from love
if you tear her world apart you have no regrets
if theres a key to your heart no ones found it yet
youre an outlaw youre an outlaw
youre an outlaw runnin from love

verse 2
your reputations getting out of control
i cant believe she believes one word you said
before i let you take my girlfriend home
ive got to warn her about the price on your head

always runnin away from someone
but you get nowhere

chorus
