who says i can’t get stoned
turn off the lights and the telephone
me in my house alone
who says i can’t get stoned
who says i can’t be free
from all of the things that i used to be
rewrite my history
who says i can’t be free

chorus
it’s been a long night in new york city
it’s been a long night in baton rouge
i don’t remember you looking any better
but then again i don’t remember you

verse 2
who says i can’t get stoned
call up a girl that i used to know
fake love for an hour or so
who says i can’t get stoned

who says i can’t take time
meet all the girls on the county line
wait on fate to send a sign
who says i can’t take time
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
it’s been a long night in new york city
it’s been a long night in austin too
i don’t remember you looking any better
but then again i don’t remember you


verse 3
who says i can’t get stoned
plan a trip to japan alone
doesn’t matter if i even go
who says i can’t get stoned

chorus
it’s been a long night in new york city
it’s been a long time since 22
i don’t remember you looking any better
but then again i don’t remember dont remember you14embed"
