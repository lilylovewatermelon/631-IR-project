my freedom is best
whole countrys on house arrest
and everyones a suspect
you cant feel the flow because you died
facedown on a suicide

the motherfuckers on selfdestruct
nobody guardin your back its all a front
save this my rage is bliss
im takin names and gettin pissed

verse 1 corey taylor
wheres chuck d when ya need him
you aint shit just a puddle on the bedspread
the maniac psycho
cool j screamed the shit but i still cant believe it

man its funny that you scare me so
just enough to fuck me up again and again
hard life is hard as hell
better back the fuck on up
cause this is

chorus corey taylor  clown
no kind of life
this is no kind of life ive got to get out
its no kind of life
this is no kind of life you cant blame me

cant be real no more your mask is skin and bone
savor every flavor you got cause its not your own
badass at bat man
forget about the battle its the war we gotta win

breathe amercult breathe one more seethe
freak like you gotta pair wont be my fault
when youre painted in the corner of a nogood life
this is

chorus corey taylor  clown
no kind of life
this is no kind of life ive got to get out
its no kind of life
this is no kind of life you cant blame me

bridge corey taylor
i cant remember i dont understand
is it malice that makes you this way
carry it with you till someone forgives you
i laugh cause theres nothing to say

you cant begin to consider the palpable hate
in the air when youre here
none of us wonder what weather youre under
youre making it perfectly clear
verse 3 corey taylor
lights aint on shit aint right
never had peace but i gotta fight
can you look in my eyes when my backs against the wall
slash at my eyes surprise youll never get me

youre all reality and sound bites
and the freedom is never in plain sight
the feelings the question
the price is too human for fucking sake
this is

chorus corey taylor  clown
no kind of life
this is no kind of life ive got to get out
its no kind of life
this is no kind of life
you cant blame me

outro corey taylor
i cant be
i cant be
i cant be blamed6embed"
