as if the first cut wasnt deep enough
i dove in again cause im not into givin up
coulda got the same rush from any lovers touch
why get used to somethin new cause no one breaks my heart like you

prechorus
when you kiss me yeah i wish we could see what happens next
for a moment i could forget what happens in my head
if i doubt you will you come through a happy second chance
or happy ending but this time you dont leave me sinkin

chorus
im under water no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im givin up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in

verse 2
as if the first blood didnt thrill enough
i went further out to see what else was left of us
never found the deep end of our little ocean
i drain the fantasy of you headfirst into shallow pools

prechorus
and i wonder is it better to get it over with
the illusion can shatter before we begin
if youre really sorry happy second chance
i think i could forgive but this time you wont leave me sinkin
