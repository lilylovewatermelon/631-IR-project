verse 1
i lost you you were my god
thought what do i do now
you were never there for me
never there to carry me
26 years looking back that time is gone
it was you i believed in
look what youve done to me
realize what youve done to me

bridge 1
oh god please
oh god please
i wanna break
for the life that walked away from me
i cant see going on
in this darkness im blind
beneath my cradle the bough has broke
i exorcise my loss your lie the punishment

chorus 1
it takes time
to try to mend the wounds of all the suffering
what do i do now
its all im asking from you please
send me a sign to
guide me through the times that lie in front of me
ill get by
myself

look at me now a piece of shit like you
look at me now you left me so fuck you
look at me now a piece of shit like you
look at me now you left me so fuck you

everybody leaves me
everybodys gone
watch my father leave me
theres nobody left feels like ive never been loved
everybody leaves me
never gave a shit about me
everybodys gone
ill rot in my head alone
everybody leaves me i dont give a fuck about you
go the fuck away
i dont give a fuck about you
never gave a shit about me go the fuck away
everybodys gone i dont give a fuck about you
go the fuck away
i dont give a fuck about you
ill rot in my head alone go the fuck away

fucking cocksucker

fake being
inside of my heart you are the liar
innocence displaced
institutionalized in my own life been left
verse 2
here i stand now and im alone
with no one to comfort me
one set of footprints in the sand
no one to take my hand ill
ill walk through as long as i need
ill drift through my life though im alone
outgrown the cradle that once housed me
and ive found that all i need is

refrain
me me me me

bridge 3
found ive never needed you
to push through
all the shit that stacks up inside of my life
endless plight that circulates through my body
ill keep stumbling beating pummeling
teething on the rind and renounce my being

i cant see going on
i cant see going on
i cant see going on
i cant see going on
i cant see
im too tired
i cant see
i cant see going on
chorus 2
im so tired
of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering
what do i do now
its all im asking from you please
send me a sign
to guide me through the times that lie in front of me
ill get by
myself

outro
i cant see going on fuck it
i cant see going on fuck it
i cant see going on fuck it
i cant see going on fuck it3embed"
