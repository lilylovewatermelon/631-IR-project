verse 1
on  on  on  on
wake the fuck up cause its been too long
say wait a minute queen whats your name
see i be that gypsy flippin life game from the right brain huh
ascension maintained
rolling through like a burning flame
like a supernova star
she be the light when they in the dark
morning
the moon pass the sun
four constellations start forming
a cross up in the sky
but everybody wanna ask me why

hook
what good do your words do if they cant understand you
dont go talkin that shit badu badu
what good do your words do if they cant understand you
dont go talkin that shit badu badu

verse 2
said im a pisces
zika deka del
well well im raising hell
people always tryin to find the world im in
im the envy of the women and i rule the men
two fish one swimmin up stream
one swimmin down livin in a dream
but when she loves she tends to cling
when incense burns smoke unfurls
analog girl in a digital world
the rasta style flower child
zip dip dow zip dip dow
the gold tooth smile
split them vowels
bling bloom bling melanated
im bout ta give birth to church
but everybody want to ask this earth

interlude
bridge

bridge
i remember when i went
with momma to the washateria
remember how i felt the day
i first started my period
remember there in school one day
i learned i was inferior
water in my cereal
badu in your stereo
holla if you hear me though
remembering is good if you dont
let it be the fear in you
wrap ya head with this material material
cause you did not do your math
my cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
mad props to the god jaborn
verse 3
things just aint the same for singers
gotta sing on the beats they bring us
but thats all i have aint got no mo
but still the people really wanna to know

hook
what good do your words do if they cant understand you

what good do your words do if they cant understand you
dont go talkin that shit badu badu6embed"
