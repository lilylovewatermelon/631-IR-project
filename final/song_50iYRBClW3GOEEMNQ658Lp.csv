theres an urgency im feeling for the first time
its all mine
do we dream about each other at the same time
all right
this might be the only way to talk to you
thats right
its your ears with the sound that ill walk into
your mind

chorus
is it the party that aint over til its through
is it the wiring thats suddenly a blown fuse
is it a chemical that makes this moment true
is it the music that connects me to you

verse 2
theres a way to get together when im gone away
one day
its a place that all that matters are the notes you play
i say
simple pleasures when im listening it gets me by
wont lie
when youre singing ill be with you til the exit line
we shine

is it the party that aint over til its through
is it the wiring thats suddenly a blown fuse
is it a chemical that makes this moment true
is it the music that connects me to you

bridge
here i was awaiting
praying for the muse
im finally awake and you have
left me less confused
maybe now
you will hear me now
im just in love
in love with your sound

chorus
is it the party that aint over til its through
is it the wiring thats suddenly a blown fuse
is it a chemical that makes this moment true
is it the music that connects me to you

outro
your song it gets me by
when youre singing ill be with you til the exit lineembed"
