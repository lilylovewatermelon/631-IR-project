verse 1 sean biggs  akon
im from the hard knock academy automatically had to be
carryin automatics sprayin sporadic inaccurate wuh
clips to the back of it barrel cockin immaculate
learn to move packages in and out of los angeles
we savages bustin off rounds sprayin banana clips
knockin pounds off em like anna nicole smith
shit im in the hood walkin with choppers
cockin and poppin at coppers glocks be talkin like
blockedie block block
i probably popped hoffa and possibly just forgot where i tossed em huh
this niggas obnoxious me and top got your bitch in the cockpit
she want a pit stop just see how the cock spit
these bosses deposit the profit they watch as we cop it
on top of the ostrich and foxes thats right
i used to be a little bastard of stress ey
now imma boss where im from ey

when they see the sad happy faces they know the dramas on
