and i love this city but im really not from here
now i gotta leave this town as a washed up stuntman
in a beat up coupe i imagine is a mustang
theres a voice in my head singing out turn it around
but im on a highway honey tearing up the east bound
theres a man out there smiling like a dying king
laughing at my soul searching for anything

and i’ve got mine
i am a rock i am an isle
and i got mine
im shaking ground im faking found
in my little town

these days im searching for the great unknown
wondering if paul simon ever had it good alone
find me a place that can make a couple tables turn
that’s warm all winter with a couple more bridges to burn

and i am a child yet ive got to let my spirit roam
a few more years before i’ll hitch a ride home
i’ve got bones to break and miles to go alone
one day i’ll start writing like i’m leonard cohen
see wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeand i’ve got mine
i am a rock i am an isle
and i got mine
im shaking ground im faking found
in my little town

im still tall and made of stone
but i still cant rest on my own

im still tall and made of stone
but i still cant rest on my own

im on my ownembed"
