wake up wake up
grab a brush and put a little makeup
hide your scars to fade away the shakeup hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
whyd you leave the keys upon the table
here you go create another fable you wanted to
grab a brush and put a little makeup you wanted to
hide the scars to fade away the shakeup you wanted to
whyd you leave the keys upon the table you wanted to
