ooh oohoohooh ooh ooh
take a look around the room
love comes wearing disguises
how to go about and choose
break it down by shapes and sizes
im a man whos got very specific taste

oh you got a pulse and you are breathing
youyouyoure just my type
ooh i think its time that we get leaving
youyouyoure just my type

verse 2
when theres loving in the air
dont fight it just keep breathing
i cant help myself but stare
double check for double meanings
im a man whos got very specific taste

oh you got a pulse and you are breathing

ooh i think its time that we get leaving
