oh babe

verse 1
never thought i would be like this
wide awake waitin on a goodnight kiss
sippin ninety proof talkin to the moon
countin down the hours till its two am
never thought i would be like this

chorus
but as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin me a text sayin
comin home soon
as long as i can bet on you crawlin into bed after slippin out ya high heel shoes
i aint lyin sayin have a good time
out with your girls girl do what you do
no matter how late baby ill be stayin up
i cant sleep without you

verse 2
id be tossin and turnin all night babe
from the smell of your hair on the pillow case
even if i tried without you by my side
id be dreamin with my eyes open
id be tossin and turnin all night babe

but as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin me a text sayin
