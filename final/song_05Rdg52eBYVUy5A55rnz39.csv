well ive been saved by the grace of southern charm
i got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a hallmark card
if you wanna pick a fight
well im gonna to have to say good night
i dont have to be hateful i can just say bless your heart
and even though i dont belong with your high life friends
doesnt mean we dont get together and try to make amends
its easier cant you see lets agree to just disagree
we dont have to like each other but its sure fun to pretend

chorus
so lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
you got your friends just like i got mine
we might think a little differently
but we got a lot in common you will see
were just like you only prettier

verse 2
everybody says you gotta know your enemies
even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
if you just smile and behave you could always get your way
its a universal plan thatll get you where you can in all societies

chorus
so lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
you got your friends just like i got mine
we might think a little differently
but we got a lot in common you will see
were just like you only prettier

chorus
so lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
you got your friends just like i got mine
we might think a little differently
but we got a lot in common you will see
were just like you only prettier
