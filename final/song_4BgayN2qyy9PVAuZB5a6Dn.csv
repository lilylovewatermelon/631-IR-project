elle if a girl like you cant win back her man then there is no hope for the rest of us
you go and you fight for him

the irish fear nothing and no one
they keep fighting til everyones dead
im not sure where this metaphors going
i just felt like it had to be said

theres a guy at that party who loves you
something most of us only dream of
you go out there and you get some ireland
the country of whiskey and loveyou might also likeembed"
