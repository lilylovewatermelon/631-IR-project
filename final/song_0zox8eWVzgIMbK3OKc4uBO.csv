fireflies are out tonight
air is heavy
and the moon is bright
i love this time of year

i talked to you this afternoon
you said you didnt have very much to do
i said id be here
so come on over come on in
come on by baby

otis redding makes me feel good
dancing in the kitchen barefoot
all the windows up
just cant get enough

headlights on my front lawn
i guess it didnt take you very long to decide
to come on over
come on in
come inside baby

wont you come on up
come on in
come inside baby
theres just something bout the way
see sara evans liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
the way you talk to me
you give just what i need
and when you come around
my feet cant find the ground

im losing myself like a drop in the rain
you twist me up like a hurricane
i cant stand up for falling down

so come on up
come on in
i like it when you come around

verse 2
a minute ago
there were a million stars
and now its soaking wet out in my backyard
lets take cover baby

but you just wanna run around in the rain
you make me laugh like a kid again
loud and crazy baby
theres just something bout the way
