here in my one room home
no one comes round no more
no one knocks on my door
was high then came the fall
the tax man took it all
i didnt play the rules
i was a careless fool

but its gonna get better
feel it in my bones
just got to hold you cause im all alone
i need your touch
i need you here to stay
this time ill never let you get away

they laughed at all my jokes
look around where are those crazy folks

i think of real good times
those wasted partying nights

just bring your loving home
dont waste love on the phone
i love you yes its true
hells what ive been going through
therell be more ups and downs
please make that turn around
not that weve played away
youre coming home to stay
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeand its gonna get better
feel it in my bones
just got to hold you cause im all alone
i need your touch
i need you here to stay
never ever gonna let you get away
feel it in my bones
feel it in my bones
cause im all aloneembed"
