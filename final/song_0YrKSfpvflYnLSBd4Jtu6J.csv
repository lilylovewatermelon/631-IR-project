verse 1
the hate be so real the love be fake

dont go against me then ask for my help
go get out your feelings and get it yourself
might got the same shoes but you aint gon step nope

you cant compete when you cant compare period
she ate the dick through my underwear uh
got up and got hеrself outta there
i see thеy put me on memes and things
dont speak on my life without knowin the real
eight figures a year what it cost me to live
