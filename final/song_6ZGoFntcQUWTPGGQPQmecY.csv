and my obsession with success by definition of my own
sure as death is waitin on our flesh and bones
demon callin my spirit had to click the phone
couldnt get to courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
told her you like the strongest woman on the fuckin globe
i watch my momma lose her momma
go through drama and trauma but had to keep her head high
so we dont fuckin know

and your feet just as heavy you been draggin through the storm oh
starin at the city but you trapped inside a hole oh
get your back up off the ropes keep swangin on yeah
