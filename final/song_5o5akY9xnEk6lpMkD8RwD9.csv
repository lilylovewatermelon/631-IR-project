caught the teacher giving his eyes to a student
pouty pretty cute and she bit her lip back to him
chewing on her nails and her pens while shes dreaming of him
and hes fucking in sin you know he is

prechorus
she said its for all the right reasons baby
dont care bout grades just call me your lady
if i pass this quiz will you give me your babies
dont call me crazy
you love me but you wont come save me
you got a wife and kids you see them daily
dont know why you even made me

chorus
teachers pet
if im so special why am i secret
yeah why the fuck is that
do you regret the things we shared that ill never forget
well do you tell me that
i know im young but my mind is well beyond my years
i knew this wouldnt last but fuck you dont you leave me here
teachers pet
if im so special why am i secret why am i

shes feeling like a spider in a cage
you liar you were her desire
now she wants to light you on fire
but fuck it shell still give you a call
and a lighter when you wanna get high
and mess around til you get numb

prechorus
she said its for all the right reasons baby
dont care bout grades just call me your lady
if i pass this quiz will you give me your babies
dont call me crazy
you love me but you wont come save me
you got a wife and kids you see them daily
dont know why you even made me

chorus
teachers pet
if im so special why am i secret
yeah why the fuck is that
do you regret the things we shared that ill never forget
well do you tell me that
i know im young but my mind is well beyond my years
i knew this wouldnt last but fuck you dont you leave me here
teachers pet
if im so special why am i secret why am i
