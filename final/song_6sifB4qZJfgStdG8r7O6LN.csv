i been crazy for you so long
how could something so right turn out so wrong
words never mean what they say
words just get in the way

chorus
before this night is through
gonna make you see
how l been blind to you
you been blind to me
before this night is through were gonna get to the truth
before this night is through
gonna heal the pain
before this night is through
youll be back again
no matter what we do i know well be all right
before this night is through

verse 2
hearts broken in pieces no time to mend
without loving they fall apart in the end
fools never admit theyre wrong
they live their lives alone

chorus
before this night is through
girl were gonna see how i belong to you
you belong to me
before this night is through were gonna get to the truth
before this night is through
well get past the pain
before this night is through
youll be back again
no matter what we do i know well be ll right
before this night is through

come inside close the door come to me now
well find our way we know how
let the past be the past let it all fall away
baby i know we told lies and to lie is a sin
well get to the truth we will simply begin
before this night is through were gonna get to the truth

chorus
before this night is through
well get past the pain
before this night is through
youll come back again
no matter what we do i know well be all right
before this night before this night is through yeah
