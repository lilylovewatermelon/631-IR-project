6gWG3u67LxRO9FQaQ8Glsg,One Night At A Time - Edit,George Strait,2CIOi72adKDDQpj9x69qpW,"1 contributorjeeves and the hardboiled egg lyricssometimes of a morning as ive sat in bed sucking down the early cup of tea and watched my man jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the raiment for the day ive wondered what the deuce i should do if the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me its not so bad now im in new york but in london the anxiety was frightful there used to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him away from me young reggie foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him double what i was giving him and alistair binghamreeves whos got a valet who had been known to press his trousers sideways used to look at him when he came to see me with a kind of glittering hungry eye which disturbed me deucedly bally pirates

the thing you see is that jeeves is so dashed competent you can spot it even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt

i rely on him absolutely in every crisis and he never lets me down and whats more he can always be counted on to extend himself on behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearances kneedeep in the bouillon take the rather rummy case for instance of dear old bicky and his uncle the hardboiled egg

it happened after i had been in america for a few months i got back to the flat latish one night and when jeeves brought me the final drink he said

mr bickersteth called to see you this evening sir while you were out

oh i said

twice sir he appeared a trifle agitated

what pipped

he gave that impression sir

i sipped the whisky i was sorry if bicky was in trouble but as a matter of fact i was rather glad to have something i could discuss freely with jeeves just then because things had been a bit strained between us for some time and it had been rather difficult to hit on anything to talk about that wasnt apt to take a personal turn you see i had decidedrightly or wronglyto grow a moustache and this had cut jeeves to the quick he couldnt stick the thing at any price and i had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till i was getting jolly well fed up with it what i mean is while theres no doubt that in certain matters of dress jeevess judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume no one can call me an unreasonable chappie and manys the time ive given in like a lamb when jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties but when it comes to a valets staking out a claim on your upper lip youve simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the blighter

he said that he would call again later sir

something must be up jeeves

yes sir
i gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl it seemed to hurt jeeves a good deal so i chucked it

i see by the paper sir that mr bickersteths uncle is arriving on the carmantic

yes

his grace the duke of chiswick sir

this was news to me that bickys uncle was a duke rum how little one knows about ones pals i had met bicky for the first time at a species of beano or jamboree down in washington square not long after my arrival in new york i suppose i was a bit homesick at the time and i rather took to bicky when i found that he was an englishman and had in fact been up at oxford with me besides he was a frightful chump so we naturally drifted together and while we were taking a quiet snort in a corner that wasnt all cluttered up with artists and sculptors and whatnot he furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted imitation of a bullterrier chasing a cat up a tree but though we had subsequently become extremely pally all i really knew about him was that he was generally hard up and had an uncle who relieved the strain a bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances

if the duke of chiswick is his uncle i said why hasnt he a title why isnt he lord whatnot

mr bickersteth is the son of his graces late sister sir who married captain rollo bickersteth of the coldstream guards

jeeves knows everything

is mr bickersteths father dead too

yes sir

leave any money

no sir

i began to understand why poor old bicky was always more or less on the rocks to the casual and irreflective observer if you know what i mean it may sound a pretty good wheeze having a duke for an uncle but the trouble about old chiswick was that though an extremely wealthy old buster owning half london and about five counties up north he was notoriously the most prudent spender in england he was what american chappies would call a hardboiled egg if bickys people hadnt left him anything and he depended on what he could prise out of the old duke he was in a pretty bad way not that that explained why he was hunting me like this because he was a chap who never borrowed money he said he wanted to keep his pals so never bit any ones ear on principle
at this juncture the door bell rang jeeves floated out to answer it

yes sir mr wooster has just returned i heard him say and bicky came trickling in looking pretty sorry for himself

halloa bicky i said jeeves told me you had been trying to get me jeeves bring another glass and let the revels commence whats the trouble bicky

im in a hole bertie i want your advice

say on old lad

my uncles turning up tomorrow bertie

so jeeves told me

the duke of chiswick you know

so jeeves told me

bicky seemed a bit surprised

jeeves seems to know everything

rather rummily thats exactly what i was thinking just now myself

well i wish said bicky gloomily that he knew a way to get me out of the hole im in
jeeves shimmered in with the glass and stuck it competently on the table

mr bickersteth is in a bit of a hole jeeves i said and wants you to rally round

very good sir

bicky looked a bit doubtful

well of course you know bertie this thing is by way of being a bit private and all that

i shouldnt worry about that old top i bet jeeves knows all about it already dont you jeeves

yes sir

eh said bicky rattled

i am open to correction sir but is not your dilemma due to the fact that you are at a loss to explain to his grace why you are in new york instead of in colorado

bicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind

how the deuce do you know anything about it

i chanced to meet his graces butler before we left england he informed me that he happened to overhear his grace speaking to you on the matter sir as he passed the library door

bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh

well as everybody seems to know all about it theres no need to try to keep it dark the old boy turfed me out bertie because he said i was a brainless nincompoop the idea was that he would give me a remittance on condition that i dashed out to some blighted locality of the name of colorado and learned farming or ranching or whatever they call it at some bally ranch or farm or whatever its called i didnt fancy the idea a bit i should have had to ride horses and pursue cows and so forth i hate horses they bite at you i was all against the scheme at the same time dont you know i had to have that remittance

i get you absolutely dear boy

well when i got to new york it looked a decent sort of place to me so i thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop here so i cabled to my uncle telling him that i had dropped into a good business wheeze in the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea he wrote back that it was all right and here ive been ever since he thinks im doing well at something or other over here i never dreamed dont you know that he would ever come out here what on earth am i to do

jeeves i said what on earth is mr bickersteth to do

you see said bicky i had a wireless from him to say that he was coming to stay with meto save hotel bills i suppose ive always given him the impression that i was living in pretty good style i cant have him to stay at my boardinghouse

thought of anything jeeves i said

to what extent sir if the question is not a delicate one are you prepared to assist mr bickersteth

ill do anything i can for you of course bicky old man

then if i might make the suggestion sir you might lend mr bickersteth

no by jove said bicky firmly i never have touched you bertie and im not going to start now i may be a chump but its my boast that i dont owe a penny to a single soulnot counting tradesmen of course

i was about to suggest sir that you might lend mr bickersteth this flat mr bickersteth could give his grace the impression that he was the owner of it with your permission i could convey the notion that i was in mr bickersteths employment and not in yours you would be residing here temporarily as mr bickersteths guest his grace would occupy the second spare bedroom i fancy that you would find this answer satisfactorily sir

bicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at jeeves in an awed sort of way

i would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to his grace on board the vessel notifying him of the change of address mr bickersteth could meet his grace at the dock and proceed directly here will that meet the situation sir

absolutely

thank you sir

bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed

how does he do it bertie he said ill tell you what i think it is i believe its something to do with the shape of his head have you ever noticed his head bertie old man it sort of sticks out at the back


i hopped out of bed early next morning so as to be among those present when the old boy should arrive i knew from experience that these ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour it wasnt much after nine by the time id dressed and had my morning tea and was leaning out of the window watching the street for bicky and his uncle it was one of those jolly peaceful mornings that make a chappie wish hed got a soul or something and i was just brooding on life in general when i became aware of the dickens of a spate in progress down below a taxi had driven up and an old boy in a top hat had got out and was kicking up a frightful row about the fare as far as i could make out he was trying to get the cab chappie to switch from new york to london prices and the cab chappie had apparently never heard of london before and didnt seem to think a lot of it now the old boy said that in london the trip would have set him back eightpence and the cabby said he should worry i called to jeeves

the duke has arrived jeeves

yes sir

thatll be him at the door now

jeeves made a long arm and opened the front door and the old boy crawled in looking licked to a splinter

how do you do sir i said bustling up and being the ray of sunshine your nephew went down to the dock to meet you but you must have missed him my names wooster dont you know great pal of bickys and all that sort of thing im staying with him you know would you like a cup of tea jeeves bring a cup of tea

old chiswick had sunk into an armchair and was looking about the room

does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew francis

absolutely

it must be terribly expensive

pretty well of course everything costs a lot over here you know

he moaned jeeves filtered in with the tea old chiswick took a stab at it to restore his tissues and nodded

a terrible country mr wooster a terrible country nearly eight shillings for a short cabdrive iniquitous he took another look round the room it seemed to fascinate him have you any idea how much my nephew pays for this flat mr wooster

about two hundred dollars a month i believe

what forty pounds a month

i began to see that unless i made the thing a bit more plausible the scheme might turn out a frost i could guess what the old boy was thinking he was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knew of poor old bicky and one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring for dear old bicky though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled as an imitator of bullterriers and cats was in many ways one of the most pronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gents underwear

i suppose it seems rummy to you i said but the fact is new york often bucks chappies up and makes them show a flash of speed that you wouldnt have imagined them capable of it sort of develops them something in the air dont you know i imagine that bicky in the past when you knew him may have been something of a chump but its quite different now devilish efficient sort of chappie and looked on in commercial circles as quite the nib

i am amazed what is the nature of my nephews business mr wooster

oh just business dont you know the same sort of thing carnegie and rockefeller and all these coves do you know i slid for the door awfully sorry to leave you but ive got to meet some of the lads elsewhere

coming out of the lift i met bicky bustling in from the street

halloa bertie i missed him has he turned up

hes upstairs now having some tea

what does he think of it all

hes absolutely rattled

ripping ill be toddling up then toodleoo bertie old man see you later

pippip bicky dear boy

he trotted off full of merriment and good cheer and i went off to the club to sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and going down the other

it was latish in the evening when i looked in at the flat to dress for dinner

wheres everybody jeeves i said finding no little feet pattering about the place gone out

his grace desired to see some of the sights of the city sir mr bickersteth is acting as his escort i fancy their immediate objective was grants tomb

i suppose mr bickersteth is a bit braced at the way things are goingwhat

sir

i say i take it that mr bickersteth is tolerably full of beans

not altogether sir

whats his trouble now

the scheme which i took the liberty of suggesting to mr bickersteth and yourself has unfortunately not answered entirely satisfactorily sir

surely the duke believes that mr bickersteth is doing well in business and all that sort of thing

exactly sir with the result that he has decided to cancel mr bickersteths monthly allowance on the ground that as mr bickersteth is doing so well on his own account he no longer requires pecuniary assistance

great scot jeeves this is awful

somewhat disturbing sir

i never expected anything like this

i confess i scarcely anticipated the contingency myself sir

i suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely

mr bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback sir

my heart bled for bicky

we must do something jeeves

yes sir

can you think of anything

not at the moment sir

there must be something we can do

it was a maxim of one of my former employers siras i believe i mentioned to you once beforethe present lord bridgnorth that there is always a way i remember his lordship using the expression on the occasionhe was then a business gentleman and had not yet received his titlewhen a patent hairrestorer which he chanced to be promoting failed to attract the public he put it on the market under another name as a depilatory and amassed a substantial fortune i have generally found his lordships aphorism based on sound foundations no doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of mr bickersteths difficulty sir

well have a stab at it jeeves

i will spare no pains sir

i went and dressed sadly it will show you pretty well how pipped i was when i tell you that i near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinnerjacket i sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because i wanted it it seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old bicky headed for the breadline

when i got back old chiswick had gone to bed but bicky was there hunched up in an armchair brooding pretty tensely with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes he had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies call some blunt instrument

this is a bit thick old thingwhat i said

he picked up his glass and drained it feverishly overlooking the fact that it hadnt anything in it

im done bertie he said

he had another go at the glass it didnt seem to do him any good

if only this had happened a week later bertie my next months money was due to roll in on saturday i could have worked a wheeze ive been reading about in the magazine advertisements it seems that you can make a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few dollars and start a chickenfarm jolly sound scheme bertie say you buy a hencall it one hen for the sake of argument it lays an egg every day of the week you sell the eggs seven for twentyfive cents keep of hen costs nothing profit practically twentyfive cents on every seven eggs or look at it another way suppose you have a dozen eggs each of the hens has a dozen chickens the chickens grow up and have more chickens why in no time youd have the place covered kneedeep in hens all laying eggs at twentyfive cents for every seven youd make a fortune jolly life too keeping hens he had begun to get quite worked up at the thought of it but he slopped back in his chair at this juncture with a good deal of gloom but of course its no good he said because i havent the cash

youve only to say the word you know bicky old top

thanks awfully bertie but im not going to sponge on you

thats always the way in this world the chappies youd like to lend money to wont let you whereas the chappies you dont want to lend it to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and lift the specie out of your pockets as a lad who has always rolled tolerably free in the right stuff ive had lots of experience of the second class manys the time back in london ive hurried along piccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp excited yapping as he closed in on me ive simply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters i didnt care a hang for yet here was i now dripping doubloons and pieces of eight and longing to hand them over and bicky poor fish absolutely on his uppers not taking any at any price

well theres only one hope then

whats that

jeeves

sir

there was jeeves standing behind me full of zeal in this matter of shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree youre sitting in the old armchair thinking of this and that and then suddenly you look up and there he is he moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish the thing startled poor old bicky considerably he rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant im used to jeeves now but often in the days when he first came to me ive bitten my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst

did you call sir

oh there you are jeeves

precisely sir

jeeves mr bickersteth is still up the pole any ideas

why yes sir since we had our recent conversation i fancy i have found what may prove a solution i do not wish to appear to be taking a liberty sir but i think that we have overlooked his graces potentialities as a source of revenue

bicky laughed what i have sometimes seen described as a hollow mocking laugh a sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat rather like a gargle

i do not allude sir explained jeeves to the possibility of inducing his grace to part with money i am taking the liberty of regarding his grace in the light of an at presentif i may say souseless property which is capable of being developed

bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way im bound to say i didnt get it myself

couldnt you make it a bit easier jeeves

in a nutshell sir what i mean is this his grace is in a sense a prominent personage the inhabitants of this country as no doubt you are aware sir are peculiarly addicted to shaking hands with prominent personages it occurred to me that mr bickersteth or yourself might know of persons who would be willing to pay a small feelet us say two dollars or threefor the privilege of an introduction including handshake to his grace

bicky didnt seem to think much of it

do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to shake hands with my uncle

i have an aunt sir who paid five shillings to a young fellow for bringing a movingpicture actor to tea at her house one sunday it gave her social standing among the neighbours

bicky wavered

if you think it could be done

i feel convinced of it sir

what do you think bertie

im for it old boy absolutely a very brainy wheeze

thank you sir will there be anything further good night sir

and he floated out leaving us to discuss details

until we started this business of floating old chiswick as a moneymaking proposition i had never realized what a perfectly foul time those stock exchange chappies must have when the public isnt biting freely nowadays i read that bit they put in the financial reports about the market opened quietly with a sympathetic eye for by jove it certainly opened quietly for us youd hardly believe how difficult it was to interest the public and make them take a flutter on the old boy by the end of the week the only name we had on our list was a delicatessenstore keeper down in bickys part of the town and as he wanted us to take it out in sliced ham instead of cash that didnt help much there was a gleam of light when the brother of bickys pawnbroker offered ten dollars money down for an introduction to old chiswick but the deal fell through owing to its turning out that the chap was an anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him at that it took me the deuce of a time to persuade bicky not to grab the cash and let things take their course he seemed to regard the pawnbrokers brother rather as a sportsman and benefactor of his species than otherwise

the whole thing im inclined to think would have been off if it hadnt been for jeeves there is no doubt that jeeves is in a class of his own in the matter of brain and resource i dont think i have ever met a chappie so supremely like mother made he trickled into my room one morning with a good old cup of tea and intimated that there was something doing

might i speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace sir

its all off weve decided to chuck it

sir

it wont work we cant get anybody to come

i fancy i can arrange that aspect of the matter sir

do you mean to say youve managed to get anybody

yes sir eightyseven gentlemen from birdsburg sir

i sat up in bed and spilt the tea

birdsburg

birdsburg missouri sir

how did you get them

i happened last night sir as you had intimated that you would be absent from home to attend a theatrical performance and entered into conversation between the acts with the occupant of the adjoining seat i had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration in his buttonhole sira large blue button with the words boost for birdsburg upon it in red letters scarcely a judicious addition to a gentlemans evening costume to my surprise i noticed that the auditorium was full of persons similarly decorated i ventured to inquire the explanation and was informed that these gentlemen forming a party of eightyseven are a convention from a town of the name if birdsburg in the state of missouri their visit i gathered was purely of a social and pleasurable nature and my informant spoke at some length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in the city it was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction and pride that a deputation of their number had been introduced to and had shaken hands with a wellknown prizefighter that it occurred to me to broach the subject of his grace to make a long story short sir i have arranged subject to your approval that the entire convention shall be presented to his grace tomorrow afternoon

i was amazed this chappie was a napoleon

eightyseven jeeves at how much a head

i was obliged to agree to a reduction for quantity sir the terms finally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party

i thought a bit

payable in advance

no sir i endeavoured to obtain payment in advance but was not successful

well any way when we get it ill make it up to five hundred bickyll never know do you suspect mr bickersteth would suspect anything jeeves if i made it up to five hundred

i fancy not sir mr bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman but not bright

all right then after breakfast run down to the bank and get me some money

yes sir

you know youre a bit of a marvel jeeves

thank you sir

righto

very good sir

when i took dear old bicky aside in the course of the morning and told him what had happened he nearly broke down he tottered into the sittingroom and buttonholed old chiswick who was reading the comic section of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution

uncle he said are you doing anything special tomorrow afternoon i mean to say ive asked a few of my pals in to meet you dont you know

the old boy cocked a speculative eye at him

there will be no reporters among them

reporters rather not why

i refuse to be badgered by reporters there were a number of adhesive young men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views on america while the boat was approaching the dock i will not be subjected to this persecution again

thatll be absolutely all right uncle there wont be a newspaperman in the place

in that case i shall be glad to make the acquaintance of your friends

youll shake hands with them and so forth

i shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rules of civilized intercourse

bicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club where he babbled freely of hens incubators and other rotten things

after mature consideration we had decided to unleash the birdsburg contingent on the old boy ten at a time jeeves brought his theatre pal round to see us and we arranged the whole thing with him a very decent chappie but rather inclined to collar the conversation and turn it in the direction of his hometowns new watersupply system we settled that as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand each gang should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of the dukes society by jeevess stopwatch and that when their time was up jeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly then we parted with what i believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill the birdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop out some day and take a look at the new watersupply system for which we thanked him

next day the deputation rolled in the first shift consisted of the cove we had met and nine others almost exactly like him in every respect they all looked deuced keen and businesslike as if from youth up they had been working in the office and catching the bosss eye and whatnot they shook hands with the old boy with a good deal of apparent satisfactionall except one chappie who seemed to be brooding about somethingand then they stood off and became chatty

what message have you for birdsburg duke asked our pal

the old boy seemed a bit rattled

i have never been to birdsburg

the chappie seemed pained

you should pay it a visit he said the most rapidlygrowing city in the country boost for birdsburg

boost for birdsburg said the other chappies reverently

the chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue

say

he was a stout sort of wellfed cove with one of those determined chins and a cold eye

the assemblage looked at him

as a matter of business said the chappiemind you im not questioning anybodys good faith but as a matter of strict businessi think this gentleman here ought to put himself on record before witnesses as stating that he really is a duke

what do you mean sir cried the old boy getting purple

no offence simply business im not saying anything mind you but theres one thing that seems kind of funny to me this gentleman here says his names mr bickersteth as i understand it well if youre the duke of chiswick why isnt he lord percy something ive read english novels and i know all about it

this is monstrous

now dont get hot under the collar im only asking ive a right to know youre going to take our money so its only fair that we should see that we get our moneys worth

the watersupply cove chipped in

youre quite right simms i overlooked that when making the agreement you see gentlemen as business men weve a right to reasonable guarantees of good faith we are paying mr bickersteth here a hundred and fifty dollars for this reception and we naturally want to know

old chiswick gave bicky a searching look then he turned to the watersupply chappie he was frightfully calm

i can assure you that i know nothing of this he said quite politely i should be grateful if you would explain

well we arranged with mr bickersteth that eightyseven citizens of birdsburg should have the privilege of meeting and shaking hands with you for a financial consideration mutually arranged and what my friend simms here meansand im with himis that we have only mr bickersteths word for itand he is a stranger to usthat you are the duke of chiswick at all

old chiswick gulped

allow me to assure you sir he said in a rummy kind of voice that i am the duke of chiswick

then thats all right said the chappie heartily that was all we wanted to know let the thing go on

i am sorry to say said old chiswick that it cannot go on i am feeling a little tired i fear i must ask to be excused

but there are seventyseven of the boys waiting round the corner at this moment duke to be introduced to you

i fear i must disappoint them

but in that case the deal would have to be off

that is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss

the chappie seemed troubled

you really wont meet the rest of them

no

well then i guess well be going

they went out and there was a pretty solid silence then old chiswick turned to bicky

well

bicky didnt seem to have anything to say

was it true what that man said

yes uncle

what do you mean by playing this trick

bicky seemed pretty well knocked out so i put in a word

i think youd better explain the whole thing bicky old top

bickys adamsapple jumped about a bit then he started

you see you had cut off my allowance uncle and i wanted a bit of money to start a chicken farm i mean to say its an absolute cert if you once get a bit of capital you buy a hen and it lays an egg every day of the week and you sell the eggs say seven for twentyfive cents

keep of hens cost nothing profit practically

what is all this nonsense about hens you led me to suppose you were a substantial business man

old bicky rather exaggerated sir i said helping the chappie out the fact is the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that remittance of yours and when you cut it off dont you know he was pretty solidly in the soup and had to think of some way of closing in on a bit of the ready pretty quick thats why we thought of this handshaking scheme

old chiswick foamed at the mouth

so you have lied to me you have deliberately deceived me as to your financial status

poor old bicky didnt want to go to that ranch i explained he doesnt like cows and horses but he rather thinks he would be hot stuff among the hens all he wants is a bit of capital dont you think it would be rather a wheeze if you were to

after what has happened after thisthis deceit and foolery not a penny

but

not a penny

there was a respectful cough in the background

if i might make a suggestion sir

jeeves was standing on the horizon looking devilish brainy

go ahead jeeves i said

i would merely suggest sir that if mr bickersteth is in need of a little ready money and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere he might secure the sum he requires by describing the occurrences of this afternoon for the sunday issue of one of the more spirited and enterprising newspapers

by jove i said

by george said bicky

great heavens said old chiswick

very good sir said jeeves

bicky turned to old chiswick with a gleaming eye

jeeves is right ill do it the chronicle would jump at it they eat that sort of stuff

old chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl

i absolutely forbid you francis to do this thing

thats all very well said bicky wonderfully braced but if i cant get the money any other way

wait erwait my boy you are so impetuous we might arrange something

i wont go to that bally ranch

no no no no my boy i would not suggest it i would not for a moment suggest it ii think

he seemed to have a bit of a struggle with himself ii think that on the whole it would be best if you returned with me to england ii mightin fact i think i see my way to doingtoi might be able to utilize your services in some secretarial position

i shouldnt mind that

i should not be able to offer you a salary but as you know in english political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure

the only figure ill recognize said bicky firmly is five hundred quid a year paid quarterly

my dear boy

absolutely

but your recompense my dear francis would consist in the unrivalled opportunities you would have as my secretary to gain experience to accustom yourself to the intricacies of political life toin fact you would be in an exceedingly advantageous position

five hundred a year said bicky rolling it round his tongue why that would be nothing to what i could make if i started a chicken farm it stands to reason suppose you have a dozen hens each of the hens has a dozen chickens after a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen chickens each themselves and then they all start laying eggs theres a fortune in it you can get anything you like for eggs in america chappies keep them on ice for years and years and dont sell them till they fetch about a dollar a whirl you dont think im going to chuck a future like this for anything under five hundred o goblins a yearwhat

a look of anguish passed over old chiswicks face then he seemed to be resigned to it very well my boy he said

whato said bicky all right then

jeeves i said bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner to celebrate and we were alone jeeves this has been one of your best efforts

thank you sir

it beats me how you do it

yes sir

the only trouble is you havent got much out of itwhat

i fancy mr bickersteth intendsi judge from his remarksto signify his appreciation of anything i have been fortunate enough to do to assist him at some later date when he is in a more favourable position to do so

it isnt enough jeeves

sir

it was a wrench but i felt it was the only possible thing to be done

bring my shaving things

a gleam of hope shone in the chappies eye mixed with doubt

you mean sir

and shave off my moustache

there was a moments silence i could see the fellow was deeply moved

thank you very much indeed sir he said in a low voice and popped off1embed"
