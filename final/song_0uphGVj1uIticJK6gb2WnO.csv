my mother told me one day
shes tired of my sad songs
but loving you has only
made me cry twice or so
the day that i said i loved you
you didnt say it in return
that was the day i realized
that silence is actually hurt

chorus
and i am done changing words
just so my songs sound prettier
i just dont care if it hurts
cause it hurts me too

verse 2
i hate that feeling at night
when i thought my eyes were closed
but they were open the whole time
it was just too dark to know
and what am i posed to do when
my dad cries in front of me
do i just close my eyes and
pretend like i didnt see

and i am done changing words
just so my songs sound prettier
i just dont care if it hurts
cause it hurts me too5embed"
