i used to be a sweetheart
i used to be alright
i tell myself i love you
but im creeping every night
when i met you at the party
and i told you you were pretty
i was honestly just tryin to score
but you made me wait a week
just to kiss you on the cheek
now its breaking my heart to break yours

chorus
i said i love you in the summer
but will i love you in the fall
i thought i wasnt like the others
guess im an asshole after all
come september ill be gone gone gone
come september ill be gone gone gone

verse 2
i used to be a good guy
i used to be alright
i tell myself i love you

when i met you at the party
and i told you you were pretty
