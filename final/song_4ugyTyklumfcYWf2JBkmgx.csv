a beatup gut string tucked behind some tvs
like a pawn shop castaway
i started strummin little nothings
i fell in love with the way it played

chorus
put aside the way that some things shimmer
beautys in the heart and not the eye
rust is just another shade of silver
not all treasure has to shine
mm

verse 2
dedication a hammer and some patience
daddy fixed that fixer up
it aint a palace but the thing about it
is what its been to all of us

chorus
put aside the way that some things shimmer
beautys in the hеart and not the eye
dust has always been our kind of glittеr
not all treasure has to shine

bridge
when i told you that i wished i couldve
put a bigger diamond on your band
you said your loves worth more than
any stone you could ever put on my hand
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
put aside the way that some things shimmer
beautys in the heart and not the eye
theres riches in our simple world together
not all treasure has to shine
mm not all treasure has to shine
