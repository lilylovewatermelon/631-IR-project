verse 1 joey bada
lets get down tonight
i think i might blow a whole pound tonight
so shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
then you know im in the house
let a nigga run his mouth its goin down on sight
im always down to fight aint duff a nigga in a while
no bluff aint no church when youre livin in the wild
i was hidden in the crowd rippin on some loud
til i seen the sucka nigga dicklickin on my style
wow mustve been the material linen
whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
all i gotta say is the word and imperials get him
word to my pops i know niggas known for serial killin
but back to the women they tryna catch me slippin
so i gotta pack a mag to stop venereal venoms from enterin my system
if it aint my moms or my sis then i cut em in the system

verse 2 joey bada
yo let me tell you what im livin like — same shit just a different night
super bad chicks and they all up in my crib tonight
bout to get down im tryna get up in the tights
so roll the indo right and i can show you what them bitches like
they just wanna come and have fun
told this little hun she could come but dont touch my funds
i might get crazy i might bust a gun
so just gimme some more and i might bust a son might bust and run
they said love will come knockin at my door well i guess lust mustve rung
the dutch touch the lungs and it was on
had her beggin for the dawn til the crack of dawn
then i passed it off to kwon
i said it gotta be the swank if it aint the rank
cause some pull hoes like how dreamers pudo
hold up let me pull ove
told her to hop in then put it back and drove and hit it outpark like al pujols

verse 3 kirk knight
shes so enticin derogatory thoughts when im citin
slangs to get her wet
and i heard youre overflowin i could test the waters like sea men
and i heard you like semen sí man
well let me slide through i know youre feelin the kid
cause these nonchalant lines is lettin me in
cause on contrast i could see us lovebirds its in plain sight
and am i right cause i heard you like the international lovin
on a higher scale when i mean scale i do it well
let me go deeper feel like im doin it well
word on the street you actin like a bastard can i be you daddy
you can hop up in my caddy and i heard you got the fatty
yeah cellurite
just remember its amazin how i come up on the track
so duck and weave and please believe my side effect is shakin knees
damn here i go again with the suggestive themes
chorus joey bada  cj fly
so tell me where its at and im in the spot
so what you wanna do
i said so tell me where its at and im in the spot
we got a lot to come true
i said so tell me where its at and im in the spot
so what you wanna do
so tell me where its at and im in the spot
we got a lot to come true
i said so tell me where its at and im in the spot
so what you wanna do
