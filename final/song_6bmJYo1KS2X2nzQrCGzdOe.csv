his names doom
they wonder just who is he
but dont worry
believe me hell get busy
when it comes to
poetry hes got plenty
la la lahhhhhh la la la la lah

mf doom
jump em in like jump rope double dutch
then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke subtle touch
cuddle clutch is this thing on
like the fling with mrs king kong this spring gone
sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
he came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
surely i jest the best on a wireless mic
not an eye test yet i digress
but why stress try and remember when
maybe bit the tender skinned babysitter gwendolyn
the type to hit and run and go tell a friend
word to el muerto cucaracha exoskeleton
he know flow like interstellar wind
tow a rap djinn by his toe into hell again
ahem one two check me too
loose wreck see through your gooseneck eq
you might also likechorus
mf doom
aiy if i may interject
rap these days is like a pain up in the neck
cornier and phonier than a play fight
take two of these and dont phone me on the late night
 the beat wont fail me
with more rhymes than times he washed his hands and feet daily
and all that kerosene aint cheap
villain been deep since a teenage creep
peep  he always was a gentleman
and kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
right there next to where the rolodex was
before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
he dont know his own strength
when hes on the bone its like the microphones length
and width aint it funky like dingy socks
feel the full effect off cassette in your benzie box
