so grab this statement
and read between the lines
im walking on an edge
thats how i stay alive
i need a fix now
the pills i have to take
it helps me live a lie
and blinds all my mistakes

prechorus
before i die
i will have seen it all
the mountains i have climbed
help me enjoy the fall

chorus
oh the webs you weave
we are caught in the fame
the passions dead
the life youve lead
has drowned in your shame
oh the webs i weave
i am caught in this game
my passions dead
the life ive lead
has drowned me in vain
you might also likeverse 2
so paint my portrait
the colors of my life
and the untold stories are painted in black and white
i can hear the footsteps
that follow to my pulse
this paranoia has haunted me like a ghost

prechorus
before i die
i will have seen it all
the mountains i have climbed
help me enjoy the fall

chorus
oh the webs you weave
we are caught in the fame
the passions dead
the life youve lead
has drowned in your shame
oh the webs i weave
i am caught in this game
my passions dead
the life ive lead
has drowned me in vain
i will have seen it all
i will have seen it all

verse 3
im killing time
let me go
before i die
i will have seen it all
it reads their minds
brings them close
before i die
i will have seen it all

chorus
oh the webs you weave
we are caught in the fame
the passions dead
the life youve lead
has drowned in your shame
oh the webs i weave
i am caught in this game
my passions dead
the life ive lead
has drowned me in vain1embed"
