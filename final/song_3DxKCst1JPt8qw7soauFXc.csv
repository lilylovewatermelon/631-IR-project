you dont remember my name
i dont really care
can we play the game your way
can i really lose control

chorus
just once in my life
i think itd be nice
just to lose control just once
with all the pretty flowers in the dust

verse 2
mary had a lamb
his eyes black as coals
if we play very quiet my lamb
mary never has to know

chorus
just once in my life
i think itd be nice
just to lose control just once
