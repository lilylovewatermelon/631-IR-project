drowning in bourbon
numbing my pain
fighting with demons oh lord
i just wish that theyd go away
theres no light in the day
dont know how much more i can take
oh no afraid of tomorrow
the end of this bottle aint that far away

chorus mackenzie nicole
i dont know where i went wrong
ive walked a million miles and now im so far from home
and im begging and pleading for someone to help me
something wont let me lie down where i belong
theres no use in carrying on
oh no im better off alone

verse 2 jelly roll
at the end of my rope
im so close to the edge
in fear of falling cause i know theres no one to catch me down there
so all of these scars
they say make you a man
afraid of a feeling that bring back the demons thats stuck in my head
