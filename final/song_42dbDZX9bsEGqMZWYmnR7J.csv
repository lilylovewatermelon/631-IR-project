had a little love but i spread it thin
falling in her arms and out again
made a bad name for my game around town
tore up my heart and shut it down

prechorus
nothing to do
nowhere to be
a simple little kind of free
nothing to do
no one but me
and thats all i need

chorus
im perfectly lonely
im perfectly lonely
im perfectly lonely yeah
because i dont belong to anyone
nobody belongs to me

verse 2
i see friends around from time to time
when their ladies let them slip away
and when they ask me how im doing with mine
this is always what i say

chorus

bridge
and this is not to say
there never comes a day
ill take my chances and start again
and when i look behind
on all my younger times
i have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong

chorus
im perfectly lonely
im perfectly lonely
im perfectly lonely yeah
cause i dont belong to anyone
nobody belongs to me
thats the way thats the way thats the way that i want it
thats the way thats the way thats the way that i want it
thats the way thats the way thats the way that i want it
thats the way thats the way thats the way that i want it2embed"
