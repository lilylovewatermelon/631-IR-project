telling laylas story spoken
bout how all her bones are broken
hammers fall on all the pieces
two months in the cover creases

chorus
fully alive more than most
ready to smile and love life
fully alive and she knows
how to believe in futures

verse 2
all my complaints shrink to nothing
im ashamed of all my somethings
shes glad for one day of comfort
only because she has suffered

chorus
fully alive more than most
ready to smile and love life
fully alive and she knows
how to believe in futures

chorus
fully alive more than most
ready to smile and love life
fully alive and she knows
how to believe in futures
fully alive more than most
ready to smile and love life
fully alive and she knows
how to believe in futuresyou might also like9embed"
