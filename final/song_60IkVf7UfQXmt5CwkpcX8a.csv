i dont know who to trust no surprise
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

prechorus mike shinoda  chester bennington
tryin not to break but im so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
i all i ever think about is this all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

chorus chester bennington
take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
cause i swear for the last time
i wont trust myself with you

verse 2 chester bennington  mike shinoda
tension is building inside steadily
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

prechorus mike shinoda  chester bennington
tryin not to break but im so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
i all i ever think about is this all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me
