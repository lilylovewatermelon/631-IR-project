yeah this ones for the mama that i never knew never knew
i took acid just to burn all of my memories of you
i guess now i really wanna know the truth
howd you leave your only child at nine for another dude
took that pain and punched my father in the stomach til he bled
hit the store and stole a 40 and took that shit to the head
all the years that you ignored me left me sleepless in the bed
i hope that he got some kids because your only son is dead
my revenge got it in the end in the end
im so hard to reach you wont see me again me again
i spent 20 years waiting on the stairs
now im finished thinking anyone will ever hear these prayers

chorus machine gun kelly
if i die before i wake smoke me out at heavens gate
bring me back to life on sunday pour me up the devils drink
wake up go to work on monday grind it out for seven straight
