verse 1
record sales are on the mark
cause thats about the time the rumors start
where all the people talkin out of they ass
well someones gotta school ya cause ya got no class
well ive paid my dues im a seasoned dame
so why you gotta throw salt in my game
you hide behind the computer screen so that you dont have to be seen
how could a person be so mean

chorus
who are you and what do you do
that makes you think youre above me
but have you walked in my shoes
the pedestal you put yourself on
well since im breaking it down now
its gonna collapse and be gone gone
gone gone gone
gone gone gone gone

i work around the clock so fill your mouth up with a sock
and get you head up off your jock

tell me how youre feeling when you listen to this oohooh

chorus
who are you and what do you do
that makes you think youre above me
but have you walked in my shoes

well since im breaking it down now
its gonna collapse and be gone gone
