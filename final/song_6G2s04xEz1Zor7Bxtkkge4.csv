prayin on the north wind to lead me to my door
thumbing through my greenbacks swearin i made more
some cruel nightly cycle leaves me cryin on a motel floor
but i dont cry for you anymore

verse 2
for many a dark hour i look up to the sky
many unkind thoughts are laid on my hazy eyes
sometimes i get to thinkin why wait around to die
but i dont think of you so i get by

chorus
every day it seems
my whole damn lifes just a codeine dream
i dont dream of you
anymore

verse 3
the sun is gone away now green grass turns to brown
every december it gets a little bit harder to lay that bottle down
its more than just the weather that plagues this prairie town
but i wont be seeing you when i come round

chorus
every day it seems
my whole damn lifes just a codeine dream
i dont dream of you
