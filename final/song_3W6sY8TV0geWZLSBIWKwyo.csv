nettie no need to cry
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
nettie no need to cry
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes

verse 1 peter steele
in the dark bathed in cathode ray blue
miss red hook of 1922
weeping silently for the pain of others
every night a tearful rosary
a victim of the curse of empathy
her reward for compassion is to suffer

chorus peter steele
nettie no need to cry
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes

verse 2 peter steele
my shortcomings i know caused her grief
still she loves me this i cant believe
responding not with anger but a prayer
heavens just southwest of cobble hill
true i am the son of an angel
maternally not one woman compares

bridge kenny hickey  peter steele
invocus virium
solo crux matris sin
novo vis for tuit
rum repus omni dei
if you fall i will catch you
when youre lost ill be there soon
far away invocus virium but of course near solo crux matris sin
when youre sad novo vis for tuit im always here rum repus omni dei

verse 3
thank you for saving me from myself
your compassion became its own hell
unequivocally beautiful inside and out
without a doubt

chorus peter steele  kenny hickey
nettie no need to cry
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
nettie  nettie  no need to cry  dont cry
let me  let me  wipe those tear drops from your eyes
