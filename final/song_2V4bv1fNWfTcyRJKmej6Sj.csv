if i could write you a song to make you fall in love
i would already have you up under my arm
i used up all of my tricks i hope that you like this
but you probably wont you think youre cooler than me
you got designer shades just to hide your face
and you wear em around like youre cooler than me
and you never say hey or remember my name
and its probably cause you think youre cooler than me

verse 1
you got your highbrow shoes on your feet
and you wear em around like it aint shit
but you dont know the way that you look
when your steps make that much noise shh

prechorus
i got you all figured out
you need everyones eyes just to feel seen
behind your makeup
nobody knows who you even are
who do you think that you are

chorus
if i could write you a song to make you fall in love
i would already have you up under my arm
i used up all of my tricks i hope that you like this
but you probably wont you think youre cooler than me
you got designer shades just to hide your face
and you wear em around like youre cooler than me
and you never say hey or remember my name
and its probably cause you think youre cooler than me

you you you got your highbrow switch in your walk
and you dont even look when you pass by
but you dont know the way that you look
when your steps make that much noise shh

prechorus
i got you all figured out
you need everyones eyes just to feel seen
behind your make up
nobody knows who you even are
who do you think that you are

bridge
cause it sure seems it sure seems
you got no doubts you got no doubts
but we all see we all see
you got your head in the clouds

chorus
