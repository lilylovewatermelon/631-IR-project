yeah yeah
mmm

chorus
i dont know who you are anymore
talkin to the man in her mirror
that been fuckin with these bitches
and its dangerous sleepin with these strangers
every night a different woman doin the same shit
but you dont even call anymore
and you dont even care so who am i to love anyone
i know its fucked up
different city switchin women
puttin cups up gettin fucked up

postchorus
and we dont even talk anymore
aint got no time to spare
so who are we to trust anyone
and thats whats fucked up
we gon end up by ourselves and not each other
and thats so fucked up

verse 1
damn love dont live here
love i dont live here
she say why you leave your shit here
im tryna be sincere
when we both know it aint right
she hate that we can get loose
but i can never hang tight
but we dont even make love anymore
actin like our phone got our attention
though we watchin television and its painless
we act like we strangers
i just dont know who we are anymore damn
im not supposed to be here
cause love dont live here
but im here and she here
she tell me stay all night
she just want a refill
and then she want to start fights
bout what about how she feel
she tell me im a cheap thrill
i know she dont mean that
she think i feed her lies
but i dont get no feedback
as she watch me pack
baby where my keys at
kiss her on the forehead and tell her that ill be back
her teeth smacked

verse 2
i was talkin to myself the other day
my homies call me cray my mama tell me pray
she say i need a day i said i need a bae
she said believe in faith
ma they love me either way
hold up wait
let me set my alarm
you say dont sweat your alarm
and now the pressure is on
so now theres sweat in my palm
but her reception aint warm
so my deception performs
and then that silence is awkward
like am i deaf or alone
i got a jet in the morn
and she upset and im calm
and when a woman is scorned
is when your welcome is worn
and now her temperatures showin
and i just weather her storm
and she expect me to stay
i be like let go my arm
she said
chorus
i dont know who you are anymoreâ€‹
talking to the man in her mirror
ive been fuckin with these bitches

i know its fucked up
different city switchin women puttin cups up

outro
she say we dont make love anymore
actin like our phone got our attention
though we watchin television now its painless
we actin like strangers
like we dont know who we are anymore
