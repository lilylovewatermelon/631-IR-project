i dont know what i would do without you
i dont know where i would be without you
i dont know if i could breathe without you
i dont know if i could live

verse 1
give me a xanax bar i aint coming down
gas through a flame of the sparks i cant shut it down
i been chasing these stars the suns coming out
the pupil in my eyes the size of a dime
my nose is runny now
lord please forgive me of my sins
whats it take to get these problems to start coming to an end
buck 50 on the desk im touching on the whip and im thinking im bout to drive this motherfucker off a cliff
im a ball of flames
and if it wasnt for us and it wasnt for love
id throw it all away i wouldve emptied the clip
but that all switched the first time you called my name

bridge
before you
i was out here sitting in the rain
before you
i was out here living with the pain
before you
i was out here wishing i could change on a collision course i was playing chicken with a train
youre the one that im loyal to
youre the one that im devoted to
need a change and its overdue
nothing in life matters when im holding you
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likehook
i remember that night that you asked whats on my mind
and i looked you in the eyes and i told you suicide suicide
suicide suicide
its like the harder i try only made me realize without you by my side i wouldnt even be alive be alive
i wouldnt be alive without you itd be suicide suicide suicide
without you itd be suicide suicide suicide suicide
only love can save me from suicide suicide suicide
without you itd be suicide suicide suicide
only love can save me from me

verse 2
lifes taking its toll on me slowly
and youre the only one that really knows me
when we met i mixed sprite with the codeine
if you wasnt in my life i wouldve odd
came through the storm dealt with the rising flood
levels coldhearted ice is pumping through my blood vessels
ill never know what you see in this fucking drug dealer
written in blood whenever i sent you a love letter
im going back to my hole from the start
i even swam with the sharks or alone in the dark
cause thats all i know
until you came and lit a match in my soul
youre who i need when im feeling stressed
youre the calm to my storm when i feel upset
you help every time that i feel depressed
a ticking time bomb with less than a minute left
i swear to god i could blow at any second
been here before and never learned my lesson
i dont know why im always secondguessing
but youre the only one that i never question
hook
i remember that night that you asked whats on my mind
and i looked you in the eyes and i told you suicide suicide
suicide suicide
its like the harder i try only made me realize without you by my side i wouldnt even be alive be alive
i wouldnt be alive without you itd be suicide suicide suicide
without you itd be suicide suicide suicide suicide
only love can save me from suicide suicide suicide
without you itd be suicide suicide suicide
only love can save me from me

outro
i dont know what i would do without you
i dont know where i would be without you
i dont know if i could breathe without you
i dont know if i could liveembed"
