verse 1
whats up
i know we havent spoken for a while
but i was thinkin bout you
and it kinda made me smile
so many things to say
and ill put em in a letter
thought it might be easier
the words might come out better
hows your mother hows your little brother
does he still look just like you
so many things i wanna know the answers to
wish i could press rewind
and rewrite every line to the story of me and you

chorus
dont you know ive tried and ive tried to get you out my mind
but it dont get no better as each day goes by
and im lost and confused ive got nothin to lose
hope to hear from you soon
ps im still not over you you you
still not over you
you yeah mm

excuse me i really didnt mean to ramble on
but theres a lot of feelings that remain since youve been gone
i guess you thought that i woulda put it all behind me
but it seems theres always somethin right there to remind me
like a silly joke or something on the tv
boy it aint easy
when i hear our song i get that same old feeling
wish i could press rewind turn back the hands of time
and i shouldnt be telling you you

chorus
dont you know ive tried and ive tried to get you out my mind
but it dont get no better as each day goes by
and im lost and confused ive got nothin to lose
hope to hear from you soon
ps im still not over you you you
still not over you you yeah mmmm

bridge
did you know i kept all of your pictures
dont have the strength to part with them yet oh no
tried to erase the way your kisses taste
but some things a girl can never forget

chorus
dont you know ive tried and ive tried to get you out my mind
but it dont get no better as each day goes by
and im lost and confused ive got nothin to lose
hope to hear from you soon
ps im still not over you oh
still not over you
oh i tried to forget you
dont you know ive tried and ive tried to get you out my mind
but it dont get no better dont get no better
as each day goes by as each day goes by
and im lost and confused ive got nothin to lose6embed"
