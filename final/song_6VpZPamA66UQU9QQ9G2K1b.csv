people like you got nothin better to do
than throw rocks at things that shine
well you oughta be chasin your own dreams
stead of shootin holes in mine
then again keep it comin keep your big mouth runnin
keep kickin me while im down
hop on the bandwagon man while you can
better doubt me now

chorus
keep buildin that chip up on my shoulder
keep feedin that monkey on my back
i can feel your hot air blowin in colder
stokin this fire up under my ass
got me livin for the day gonna see my face
big as life and laughin out loud
lovin all you haters
beggin you to doubt me now

verse 2
like a walkon quarterback a wannabe cadillac
a backup to the third string
im outside the box aint got no shot
at the bullseye or the brass ring
yeah i heard it all bet you thought id crawl
under a rock and never wanna come out
but ill never let you give me a reason
to doubt me now

so keep buildin that chip up on my shoulder
keep feedin that monkey on my back
i can feel your hot air blowin in colder
stokin this fire up under my ass
got me livin for the day gonna see my face
big as life and laughin out loud
lovin all you haters
beggin you to doubt me now
