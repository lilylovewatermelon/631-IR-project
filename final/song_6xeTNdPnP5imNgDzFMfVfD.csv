but what i might feel are the sounds of sanity
hoping what i hear loops itself continuously
then i wont be afraid no no

my world turns flippin the bird
to the ones who figure
me outcast no not the duo
back in shaker heights where they knew who
dos little brother was a strange one boohoo
cry me a river hater look who
traveled out an igloo
coldcold world wasnt fit for me at all
look at where i stand at tall
clutchin my kid cudi bizzalls
mute motherfuckers back home quick pause
gargle on my mayo
look at me i bet im the one you think to fail
floating in my mind no sail
ahoy ahoy
