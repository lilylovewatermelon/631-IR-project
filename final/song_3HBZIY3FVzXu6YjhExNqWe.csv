lets play a little game
just between you and i
obviously physical
you gotta use your mind
we can be cops and robbers
tarzan and jane marilyn and robert
but either way the objective is the same
to please and entertain

chorus
you will be my vixen
my bedll be your stage
we will get the spotlight all night
each and every time we play
you will be my vixen
as we improvise
delivering a captivating performance every time

verse 2
why not be creative
pull out all the stops
you can pick the scene
if i can pick the props
do you prefer classroom or office
masquerade expert or novice
we can play
the objective is the same
to please and entertain
