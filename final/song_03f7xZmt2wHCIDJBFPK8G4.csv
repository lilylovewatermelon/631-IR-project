guess i better wash my mouth out with soap

verse 1
think i just remembered somethin
i think i left the faucet runnin
now my words are fillin up the tub
darling youre just soaking in it
but i know youll get out the minute
you notice all your fingers prunin up

prechorus
im tired of being careful tiptoe
trying to keep the water warm
let me under your skin
uhoh there it goes
i said too much it overflowed
why do i always spill

chorus
i feel it coming out my throat
guess i better wash my mouth out with soap
god i wish i never spoke
now i gotta wash my mouth out with soap
i feel it coming out my throat
guess i better wash my mouth out with soap
god i wish i never spoke
now i gotta wash my mouth out with soap

threw a toaster in the bathtub
im sick of all the games i have to play
