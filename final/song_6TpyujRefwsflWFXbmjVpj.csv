someone asked me once in an interview
what was growing up like
whered you go to school
and what would you do if you werent doin this
id be drivin my first car an old wornout dodge
tryin to make rent with a deadend job just makin due
with tips in a jar my guitar and an old barstool

chorus
id have a friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
cup of brown liquor couple buddies in a band
singin them same damn songs like i am now
id be feelin on fire on a hardwood stage
bright lights like lightning runnin through my veins
at the grand ole opry or a show in some noname town
id still be doin this if i werent doin this

verse 2
id still be the same guy they knew back in the day
who was burnin cds just to give away
payin his dues
if i wasnt doin this
five deep in a van head full of steam
hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin true
livin this life just like i was born to do
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
id have a friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
cup of brown liquor couple buddies in a band
singin them same damn songs like i am now
id be feelin on fire on a hardwood stage
bright lights like lightning runnin through my veins
at the grand ole opry or a show in some noname town
id still be doin this if i werent doin this

it aint about the fame
it aint about the fortune
it aint about the name
it aint about the glory
i guess im sayin its always been about

chorus
id have a friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
cup of brown liquor couple buddies in a band
singin them same damn songs like i am now
id be feelin on fire on a hardwood stage
bright lights like lightning runnin through my veins
at the grand ole opry or a show in some noname town
