i could stand behind my barricade
do what im told and be afraid to change
while isolated by the mainstream
with the current up against me
well maybe if my arms were ten feet tall
i could finally reach that crystal ball

prechorus
cause i still find inside
theres something braver
and i i wont be i wont be
the silent damnation

chorus
i will never be voiceless
my weapon of choice is
id rather be dangerous
dangerous
i wont be left defenseless
as god as my witness
id rather be dangerous
dangerous

verse 2

but ill state my observations
well i could buy my faith
like a plot in the ground
but i was never lost
and i never had a doubt

its not my imagination
and i i wont be i wont be
the silent damnation

i will never be voiceless
my weapon of choice is
id rather be dangerous
dangerous
i wont be left defenseless
as god as my witness
id rather be dangerous
dangerous
