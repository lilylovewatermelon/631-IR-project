she say why you thug me like that
i dont mean to
sometimes i feel like i dont need you
unlike other people i done been here twice before
so i know how the dices roll
so many times i had the chance to tell the truth and played you
so many times you couldve went and did you but was faithful
thats why i wanna thank you and then give you the best of me
i cant take back the past but i got the recipe
lets jump on a plane see the world together

but they dont see the makeup and the breakups and the fights
