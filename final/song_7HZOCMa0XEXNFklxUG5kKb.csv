theres a harvest each saturday night
at the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
a place you can stand for one night and get gone
its clear this conversation aint doing a thing
because these boys only listen to me when i sing
and i dont feel like singing tonight
all the same songs

chorus
here in these deep city lights
girl could get lost tonight
im finding every reason to be gone
nothing here to hold on to
could i hold you

verse 2
the situations always the same
you got your wolves in their clothes whispering hollywoods name
stealing gold from the silver they see
but its not me

chorus
here in these deep city lights
girl could get lost tonight
im finding every reason to be gone
nothing here to hold on to
could i hold you

calling out somebody save me i feel like im fading away
am i gone
calling out somebody save me i feel like im fading

chorus
here in these deep city lights
girl could get lost tonight
im finding every reason to be gone
nothing here to hold on to
could i hold you2embed"
