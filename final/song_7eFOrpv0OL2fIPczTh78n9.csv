everybodys an enemy
telling me lies and its killing me
why they all want to get rid of me
everybodys my enemy
several try to disguise the devil in them
wanting to get into my cerebellum
but im ready and willing to tell them
that i cant f with them
exhale so hard it got my chest swelling
like my dick does when watching naked women
do sick stuff on my porn collection on television

chorus nas
trust nobody
i dont know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘cause everybody is an enemy
trust nobody
i dont know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘cause everybody is an enemy

verse 2 nas
watching my own back
strapped with chrome to my homies
where the tombstones at where the hoes at
‘cause too many men act like dykes hermaphrodites
with pens they not men
look at the trash they biting
they life in times is kinda weirder
than the life and time of the sandman
on apollo theater
imagine that brother black with a hook
to pull the wack talent off the stage
im enraged
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus nas
trust nobody

‘cause everybody is an enemy
trust nobody
i dont know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
fuck everybody this is to all of you all
‘cause everybody is an enemy

bridge jonathan davis
you fill your lies around me
and you think you won
you feel you can control me
with the things youve done
you think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
youre going to start to hate me
i feel that you disgraced me
you think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
youre going to start to hate me
i feel that you disgraced me
you think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
youre going to start to hate me
i feel that you disgraced me
you think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
youre going to start to hate me
i feel that you disgraced me
you think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
youre going to start to hate me
i feel that you disgraced me
chorus nas
