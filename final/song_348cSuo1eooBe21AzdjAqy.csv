damn you look so good with your clothes on
and im not trying to come off too strong
but you know that i cant help it
cause girl youre beautiful
i cant deny i want your body
but im a gentleman so ill be
the one who takes it slowly
cause girl youre so beautiful

chorus
i wanna love you with the lights on
keep you up all night long
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
and hold you til the nights gone
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
hey hey no

verse 2
i like the vibe in this hotel room
and id really like to get to know you
start discovering your secrets
underneath these very sheets
your skins so perfect up against me
your lips are talking when we dont speak
and i never wanna leave this
cause theres so much left to see

i wanna love you with the lights on
keep you up all night long
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
and hold you til the nights gone
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
keep you up all night long
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
hold you til the nights gone
darling i wanna see every inch of you
i get lost in the way you move
i wanna love you with the lights on
