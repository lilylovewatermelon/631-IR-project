stay alive
heaven holds a place for us tonight
i am paralyzed

verse 1
close your eyes
drive away the cloud that hides the light
and leave the pain behind
dead alive find a way to bury all the lies
escape the pain inside
‘cause i don’t want to fall or let you go

chorus
love left me hollow
i’m with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don’t leave me here again

verse 2
fruit of life
i can hear the voices of the hive
chemicals collide
loaded smile
light the way for those you left behind
set the earth on fire
‘cause i don’t want enough
i want it all

love left me hollow
i’m with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don’t leave me here again
i can’t go on
you are bound to break me in
i come undone
as you drag me down again

breakdown
i come undone

chorus
love left me hollow
i’m with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don’t leave me here again
i can’t go on
you are bound to break me in

as you drag me down again5embed"
