verse 1
fire it up fire it up
when we finally turn it over
make a beeline towards the border
have a drink youve had enough
fire it up fire it up
if you need some conversation
bring a magazine to read around
our brokedown transportation
fire it up

verse 2
fire it up fire it up
when we find the perfect water
well hang out on the shore
just long enough to leave our clothes there
fine enough fine enough
oh we ate all of the oranges
off the navels of our lovers
grabbed a book and read the cover
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likechorus
it honestly was beautifully done
like trying to hide the daylight from the sun
even if we had been sure enough
its true we really didnt know
even if we knew which way to head
but still we probably wouldnt go

verse 3
fire it up fire it up
we pushed off were rolling boulders
crashing down the mirrored stairways
two of lifes best mine canaries
fire it up fire it up
when we fix the carburetor
then well push off once again
in an hour or so later

chorus
it honestly was beautifully bold
like trying to save an ice cube from the cold
even if we had been sure enough
its true we really didnt know
even if we knew which way to head
but still we probably wouldnt go

well we always well we always
had it all had it all
well we always well we always
had it all had it all
well we always well we always
