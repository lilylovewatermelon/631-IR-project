cotton candy salty kisses and a couple stolen beers
your tan lines were the map for my hands to find their way
and that empty lifeguard shack we watched our innocence fade

caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
ferris wheel make our ride
soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
tracing the tattoos on your skin
one two three months fly
like a blink in your blue eyes
where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
in beach town

sneaking in and getting kicked out at the bayside pool
and watching your tee shirt drip dry
middle of the night that was so damn cool
and sandals in your hands
swaying to the beat of an off beat cover band
spilling your drink making me sink
deeper and deeper with every half drunk wink

in that beach box salt sand tide
ferris wheel make our ride
soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
tracing the tattoos on your skin
one two three months fly
like a blink in your blue eyes
where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also likeflorida state came calling
your goodbye tears came falling
i said i dont want to go if you dont want to go
so we just kept on stalling
we kept on stalling

caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
ferris wheel make our ride
soak in the summer wind copper tone visiting
tracing the tattoos on your skin
one two three months fly
like a blink in your blue eyes
young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
in beach town
in beach townembed"
