well i got a funny feelin
but im gonna stay cool
somethings tellin me im gonna break all the rules
let me tell ya im not insecure
but i got an empty feeling that youve got the cure

chorus
you said it all youve got to stay
too proud to fall no more to say

verse 2
well im feeling sober but im high on the throne
like a demon sick and sick and tired of being alone
ive made a bed that is hard to lie in
but if lovin you is wrong
i cant do nothing but sin

chorus
you said it all youve got to stay
too proud to fall no more to say

verse 3
let them hang me
they would if they knew
even half the things ive been doing with you
walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor
watch me swingin and i still want you more

you said it all youve got to stay
too proud to fall no more to sayembed"
