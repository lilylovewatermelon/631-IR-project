i never feel like this
im used to emptiness in my heart
and in my arms
youre not what im used to
you keep me guessin with things that you do
i hope that theyre true

prechorus
cause im never gonna heal my past
if i run every time it starts
so i need to know if im in this alone

chorus
come on baby say it first
i need to hear you say those words
if im all that you desire i promise therell be fire
i need to hear you say it first
come on baby do your worst
i know youll take me higher
so come on darling
if you love me say it first
say it say it say it
wont you say it to me
say it say it say it
wont you say it to me
