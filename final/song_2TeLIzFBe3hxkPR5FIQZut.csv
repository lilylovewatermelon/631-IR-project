he could be a sinner or a gentleman
he could be a preacher when your soul is damned
he could be a lawyer on a witness stand
but hell never love you like i can can
he could be a stranger you gave a second glance
he could be a trophy of a one night stand
he could have your humour but i dont understand
cause hell never love you like i can can can

chorus
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
there may be lovers who hold out their hands
but they’ll never love you like i can can can
theyll never love you like i can can

verse 3
a chance encounter of circumstance
baby hes a mantra keeps your mind entranced
he could be the silence in this mayhem but then again
he’ll never love you like i can can can

chorus
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
there may be lovers who hold out their hands
but they’ll never love you like i can can can
theyll never love you like i can can can
theyll never love you like i can can can

chorus
why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
