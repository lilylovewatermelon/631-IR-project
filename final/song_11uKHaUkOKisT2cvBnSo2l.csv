ima lifer

verse 1
i can hear that rain fallin on this tin roof
girl after all weve been through
feels like the calm after the storm
so what you say we take this sunday
let me love you till its monday
well go have a fun day and baby well get back to us
well get back to us
weve been trippin over the same shit
im over the whos to blame shit
we throwin up a white flag
im dancin with who i came with
im your man and you my lady

chorus
baby im a lifer i aint goin nowhere
told you since day one i had to wife ya
show the world that i just wanna love ya
girl i dont wanna fight ya
yeah youre the only one for me
god knows that im a product of george strait
and dammit i love singing to you
i done check yes and gave my mamas ring to you
aint nobody was sighted
my arms cant get any wider
baby ima baby ima baby ima lifer
ima lifer ima lifer ima lifer

whatever we go through girl were family
theres nothin we cant do can we
tether through the weather got us better than before
we just gotta learn how to stay here
build on the love we made here
make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
cause i believe we can move any mountain when were good
i believe i aint me without you walkin out in that white dress
life without you is lifeless
and im your man and you my lady

chorus
baby im a lifer i aint goin nowhere
told you since day one i had to wife ya
show the world that i just wanna love ya
girl i dont wanna fight ya
yeah youre the only one for me
god knows that im a product of george strait
and dammit i love singing to you
i done check yes and gave my mamas ring to you
aint nobody was sighted
my arms cant get any wider
baby ima baby ima baby ima lifer

verse 3
the twists and turns
sometimes the love can hurt ya
sometimes it burns
the wait aint always perfect
well just keep diggin
dig our feet into the dirt and well get back to us
well get back to us
weve been trippin over the same shit
im over the whos to blame shit
we throwin up a white flag
im dancin with who i came with
cant wait to see our kids
hope they look just like you

chorus
baby im a lifer i aint goin nowhere
told you since day one i had to wife ya
show the world that i just wanna love ya
girl i dont wanna fight ya
yeah youre the only one for me
god knows that im a product of george strait
and dammit i love singing to you
i done check yes and gave my mamas ring to you
aint nobody was sighted
my arms cant get any wider
