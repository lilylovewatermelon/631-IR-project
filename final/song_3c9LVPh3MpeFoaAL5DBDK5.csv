comparisons are easily done
once youve had a taste of perfection
like an apple hanging from a tree
i picked the ripest one i still got the seed

prechorus
you said move on where do i go
i guess second best is all i will know

chorus
cause when im with him i am
thinking of you thinking of you thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one who was
spending the night spending the night spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into your eyes

postchorus
eyes

verse 2
youre like an indian summer in the middle of winter
like a hard candy with a surprise center
how do i get better once ive had the best
you said theres tons of fish in the water so the waters i will test

he pulled me in i was disgusted with myself

chorus
cause when im with him i am
thinking of you thinking of you thinking of you

how i could let myself let you go

and bust in the door and
take me away
