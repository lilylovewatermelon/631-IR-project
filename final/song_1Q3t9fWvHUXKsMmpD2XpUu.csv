doctor look into my eyes
ive been breathing air but theres no sign of life
doctor the problems in my chest
my heart feels cold as ice but its anybodys guess

prechorus
doctor can you help me cause i dont feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind
doctor can you help me cause i dont feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind

chorus
well its cold cold cold cold inside
darker in the day than the dead of night
cold cold cold cold inside
doctor can you help me cause something dont feel right
something dont feel right

verse 2
sweet nurse dont look at me that way
ive seen those eyes before i can tell you want to play
counselor give me some advice
tell me how hard will i fall if i live a double life

prechorus
doctor can you help me cause i dont feel right
better make it fast before i change my mind
doctor can you help me cause i dont feel right
better make it fast because there aint much time

my life before me like a flash in the night
with my arms open wide
