hello
hey man im sorry to call you so late

i know its three thirty in the morning man but ii just need to talk to somebody im going crazy

bridge monoxide
i dont ever wanna sleep again
never ever wanna sleep again

verse 1 monoxide child
i know im running yall
but dont know what im running from
i hear it coming yall
but dont know where its coming from
its gonna get me now
dont know how
but itll get me
i think it bit me
dont know how but it bit me
i hate sleeping im afraid of the dark
i cant believe these fucking dreams
would have me breathing so hard
its like a panic attack
and my hands get all tingly
but they said id be alright
if i took my lil blue thingies
cant wake up and im closing my eyes
cant shake it cause the demon wants to keep me inside
im on the high rise building
and im ready to jump
without a parachute
so i hit the ground like a pistol grip
pump on my lap at all times
right well this motherfucker took it
and shot me in broad day light
now im laying in the ems
i got all kinda wires hanging off of my chest
and this beep keeps beeping so i know im alive
its my alarm clock tripping
its a quarter to five quarter to five

why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
i dont never wanna sleep again wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
never ever wanna sleep again wake the fuck up

verse 2 anybody killa
wake the fuck up
bad dreams too scary
darker then the night sky body being carried
when i awake im gonna tear somebody up
cause when im swinging in my sleep
its like its never strong enough
pull the sheet tight over my head
toss and turn till the morning eyes bloodshot red
dozing off in the day hardly catch any zs
wake the fuck up in my head like a disease
somebody sing me a lullaby
chase away all these evil cries
please dont lay me down to sleep
cause behind my eyes is something deep
one of these days i may never awake
whole body ice cold staring at pearly gates
looking for a second chance to dance with the dead
underground living with the moon for a friend
never knowing how its all gone in
room full of entities and my sleep again
chorus
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
i dont never wanna sleep again wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
never ever wanna sleep again wake the fuck up

verse 3 the roc
i cant wake theres no pulse
i cant reach the door
whos wait just please shake me till im up for
the rest of the night im in and out of this dream
im tossing turning screaming
cause its changing the scene on me again
sweat pours from my pores
and im drowning life preservers finally got me
deaths a mountain
and im dropped knee high in a pillow of darkness
i need a search light please dont stop this

verse 4 jamie madrox
i was dreaming when i wrote this
i dont remember much
a little drugs few women
vampires and such
hot sex in a tub of blood
feel the heat but fuck quietly
vampires are asleep
like walking on a tight rope trying to cum
i was fucking so long had my dick all numb
then i pushed and pushed until i started to bust
then i awoke buttnaked in front of the tour bus
chorus
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
i dont never wanna sleep again wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
never ever wanna sleep again wake the fuck up
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
why are you sleeping wake the fuck up
i dont never wanna sleep again wake the fuck up
are you still dreaming wake the fuck up
never ever wanna sleep again wake the fuck upembed"
