verse 1 mariah carey
cant get him outta my mind
cant explain it but its somethin bout him makin me high
like a motor revin over and over it dont stop
he cruised beside me now im flyin drivin
through yellow lights
im ignorin every sign of caution that they provide
drivers education 101 slipped out of my mind
i need me a caddy with some cruise control
no no no

prechorus mariah carey
ive been told so many sagas
he brings the drama six baby mamas
but ohoh i cant resist him
just wanna kiss him
i need cruise control

chorus mariah carey

i dont know why i ease up on the break
every time i see his face
im outta control ah i dont know
how to stay up in my lane
every day and night

wherever i go he be cruisin
turn to the right uh he so smooth with it
deep down inside dont wanna lose him

bridge damian marley
you put your hand in cruise control
and you deny me if you want
and you will starve yourself of love
if you dont speed and break the law
you cant get no speeding ticket
on the highway to my heart
and it might be a rocky road
and you can exit if you want why you always
look at life just like a pessimist
you already like a wife up in my premises
and right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

chorus mariah carey
might needa go slow
i dont know why i ease up on the break
every time i see his face
im outta control ah i dont know
how to stay up in my lane
every day and night
hes cruisin through my brain
wherever i go he be cruisin
turn to the right uh he so smooth with it
deep down inside dont wanna lose him
he already know im willin to go
gotta get on cruise controlembed"
