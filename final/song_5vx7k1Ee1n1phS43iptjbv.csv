yeah
they probably aint gon understand what im talking bout

verse 1
pass interference if these people want challenge
i got meds inside my cup to make sure i dont panic
i took interest inside of cars now my whip panoramic
i went harder became a star now everybody wanna kill me
i dont fuck with yall changed to the devil tune
i aint gotta tell you your life in danger let the reverend do it
wishin that that hitech came in i got wockhardt for tourin
relationship soon sеx came in had nothin to offer to her

chorus
oh oh oh oh
shе want diamonds
yeah the streets want violence
gotta be another clean way about it
oh oh oh oh
she want diamonds
yeah the streets want violence
gotta be another clean way about it

verse 2
eye that i seem to aim for
stop this bitch let that thing blow
and ill forever be here if they aint know
nah for real though nigga when im in the grave they still gon play my song
ill be somewhere wishin my sons head on
make lil shorty fuck me then feel used i aint tried to

i turn up srt skrrt on these hoes like baba do
i aint gotta decide for me to be right here on side you
