if i were a human bein id head straight for new orleans
and id blow this horn so hot and strong
like no one theyve ever seen
youve heard of louis armstrong mr sidney bechet
all those boys gonna step aside
when they hear this old exgator play listen

louis plays his horn

louis
when im human as i hope to be
im gonna blow this horn til the cows come home
and everyones gonna bow down to me

spoken
thank you thank you mwah mwah
aw thank you i love you too baby

naveen
when im myself again i want just the life i had
a great big party every night
that doesnt sound too bad
a redhead on my left arm a brunette on my right
a blonde or two to hold the candles
now that seems just about right eh louis
life is short when youre done youre done
were on this earth to have some fun
and thats the way things are
you might also likelouis spoken
tell it brother

naveen
when im human and im gonna be
im gonna tear it up like i did before
and thats a royal guarantee

tiana
your modesty becomes you
and your sense of responsibility
ive worked hard for everything ive got
and thats the way its supposed to be
when im a human being at least ill act like one
if you do your best each and every day
good things are sure to come your way
whatcha give is whatcha get
my daddy said that and ill never forget
and ill recommend it to you

louisnaveentiana

tiana
