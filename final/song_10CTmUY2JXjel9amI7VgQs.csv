theres nowhere to run to when death becomes you
some say your soul may burn in the flame
can front if you want too but niggas who merked you
will come to your tombstone and piss on your grave
you a rider right down to ride tonight
nigga you gone ride or you gone die tonight
nigga cock the steele its kill or be killed
nigga shit is real in the field

verse 1 billy danze
whats the procedures nigga when you got a hammer in your mouth
will you lay down and cry will you stand up and die

you got these young niggas hollering murdara
copper tops on my block like bloc bloc bloc
niggas dont give a fuck
i seen a nigga shoot my moms
right in front of my motherfucking face
see in the â€˜ville aint no such thing as a stray bullet
when your index finger on the trigger and you pull it
slugs aint never out of season
all you gotta do is give a motherfucker one reason
blood stains on the cement
same place he stood thats were you leave em
and dont back it out unless your squeezing off with your gun
cause you gone get your punk ass robbed for your gun
you know the drill
im a give your ass 3 seconds to bounce
and you better not jog nigga run
one fuck that gun shot x3 dumb bitch rest in piss
