will you count me in

verse 1
ive been awake for a while now
youve got me feeling like a child now
cause every time i see your bubbly face
i get the tingles in a silly place

chorus
it starts in my toes and i crinkle my nose
wherever it goes i always know
that you make me smile please stay for a while now
just take your time wherever you go

verse 2
the rain is fallin on my window pane
but we are hidin in a safer place
under covers stayin dry and warm
you give me feelings that i adore

they start in my toes make me crinkle my nose
wherever it goes i always know
that you make me smile please stay for a while now
just take your time wherever you go
