my head was getting hazy
couldnt keep my feet on the ground

she was makin love to the
mirror in the bathroom
didnt hear me talkin out loud

bubblegum lipstick
babys got me nervous
somethings got a hold of my feet
you just wanna go
where your problems wont follow
baby thats okay with me

set fire with just a little spark
thats how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

set fire with just a little spark
thats how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

got no money still
aint that cool
im the little punker
whos kissin you
forget what you heard
about modern love
shes still in the mirror
honey fixin her mug and im like
you might also likeset fire with just a little spark
thats how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

live fast its a feeling not an art
just how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

kids kiss statuesque out in the street
i dont really wanna be a part of your scene
messed up all the same kids in my city
its less about what you say
and more looking pretty and im like

set fire with just a little spark
thats how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

live fast its a feeling not an art
just how it goes when youre
moving in the dark

started in the morning
my head was getting hazy
couldnt keep my feet on the ground
she was makin love to the
mirror in the bathroom
didnt hear me talkin out loud

bubblegum lipstick
babys got me nervous
somethings got a hold of my feet

you just wanna go
where your problems wont follow
baby thats okay with me

set fire with just a little spark
thats how it goes when youre moving in the darkembed"
