verse 1
so scared of breaking it that you wont let it bend
and i wrote two hundred letters i will never send
sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
youd rather cover up id rather let them bleed

and ill set you free oh yeah

why wont you answer me
the silence is slowly killing me oh yeah
