distract me stops me doin work i hate
and just to show him how it feels
i walk past his desk in heels
one leg resting on the chair
from the side he pulls my hair

verse 2
it takes me half an hour to write a verse
he makes me imagine it from bad to worse
my weakness for the other sex
every time his shoulders flex
the way the shirt hangs off his back
my train of thought spins right off track
