its five am back at it again
another day another dime
gettin home to you
is what gets me through
til its quittin time

chorus
when i walk in the door get to kiss your pretty smile
thats when it all gets better
we can sip a little wine spend a little time
baby you and i alone together
the best part of my day is when its through
with nothin left to do but kick off these boots
and lay down with you

verse 2
gonna lock in your eyes kiss the whole world goodbye
and every inch of you
gonna wrap you up with all of my love
thats what im gonna do

chorus
when i walk in the door get to kiss your pretty smile
thats when it all gets better
we can sip a little wine spend a little time
baby you and i alone together
the best part of my day is when its through
with nothin left to do but kick off these boots
and lay down with you
