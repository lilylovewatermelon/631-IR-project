girl our mamas are best friends and so are we
the whole towns rooting for us like the home team
most likely to settle down
plant a few roots real deep and let em grow
but we cant stop this real world from spinnin us
your bright lights called i dont blame you for pickin up
your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
but i just need you to know

chorus
that i love you more than a california sunset
more than a beer when you aint twentyone yet
more than a sunday morning lord
turnin some poor lost souls round and hallelujah bound
yeah i love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
when the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
but baby this might be the last time i get to lay you down
cause i cant love you more than my hometown

verse 2
i aint the runaway kind i cant change that
my hearts stuck in these streets like the train tracks
city sky aint the same black
aint that a map dot shame man to think that
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
i love you more than a california sunset
more than a beer when you aint twentyone yet
more than a sunday morning lord
turnin some poor lost souls around and hallelujah bound
yeah i love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
when the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
but baby this might be the last time i get to lay you down
cause i cant love you more than my hometown

bridge
yeah you got a wild in your eyes that i just wasnt born with
im a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin
i need a house on the hill girl not in em
so hang onto these words til them avenues help you forget em

chorus
cause i love you more than a california sunset
i love you more in a twentydollar sundress
hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
girl but i hate even more that youre leavin
cause i love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
when the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
but that aint you and me so i guess ill see you around
cause i cant love you more than my hometown
outro
love you more than my hometown
love you more than my hometown
love you more baby love you more2embed"
