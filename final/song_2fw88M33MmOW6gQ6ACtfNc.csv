verse 3 left eye

lovebirds blowin kisses in picture frame form

ill bust and implode gimme gimme room

the occasion that i am raisin massive body invasion
so what you savin all that love for
open up your mind explore and make it hardcore
you treat me like candy
ill be your candy store
give you just a little more than what you bargained for uh
and if youre askin for some guidance its not a minus
ill break it down to a science kitchen appliance

total eclipse on my lips until the end of time
