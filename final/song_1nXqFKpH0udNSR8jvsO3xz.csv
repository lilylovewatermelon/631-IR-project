in my mind in my head this is where we all came from
the dreams we have the love we share
this is what were waiting for
and in my mind in my head this is where we all came from
the dreams we have the love we share
this is what were waiting for

postchorus flo rida
ive waited for this life
waited for this time
waited for this moment to step into the light
got this drink up in my cup
one night to live it up
you know im not stopping till weve had enough

verse 1 flo rida
perfect brother cant tell you that im at but im on the right track
every time i look back its a struggle
no faith i woulda sat right there forgot about my friends
cause i done hustled no not dope just soap in vanilla envelopes
check out my demo oh im flo right now when i go right now
was it ever that simple used to roll get pumped like a pitbull
out the way said i aint got potential cake walk guess i aint get the memo
ooh take a walk in my shoes cause tonight my dreams they came true
and ima party it up through the roof
this is what were waiting for

party people
ive got the wind at my head my mind says yes when my body says when i equal
no its not an option ima yes i can til this spaceship land with the beatles
see the road blocks up and my autograph sucks but the leech is unbelievable
got the round but the bucks not wanna get bucked
but my fist up rock star sign
guitars just broke in my mind
was packing up i might get by
talking bout luck on my side oh
take a walk in my shoes
cause in like my dreams they came true
and im a party it up through the roof ooh
