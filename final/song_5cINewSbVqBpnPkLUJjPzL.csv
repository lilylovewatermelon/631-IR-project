i dont know you but i know what you did to her
she told me and i happened to believe her too

prechorus
they will be three steps behind
you will not know whats got you
oh so youre sorry now
all is not well its not ended

chorus
hold your breath til its over
theres something left underwater

verse 2
youve been quiet there are things that you do not speak of
but if you stay gone a little longer your keys wont work

prechorus
cause i will be two steps behind
you will not know whats got you
oh so youre sorry now
all is not well its not ended

chorus
hold your breath til its over
theres something left underwater
hold your breath til its over
theres something left underwater
