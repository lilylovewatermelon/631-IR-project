verse 1
for all the times that you rained on my parade
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
you think im cryin on my own well i aint

refrain
and i didnt wanna write a song
cause i didnt want anyone thinking i still care
i dont but you still hit my phone up
and baby ill be movin on
and i think you should be somethin i dont wanna hold back
maybe you should know that

prechorus
my mama dont like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and ive been so caught up in my job didnt see whats going on
but now i know im better sleeping on my own

chorus
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that im still holdin on to somethin
you should go and love yourself

but when you told me that you hated my friends
the only problem was with you and not them
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from

bridge
for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love now i feel nothin at all
i never felt so low and i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls

chorus
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that im still holdin on to somethin
you should go and love yourself
cause if you like the way you look that much
