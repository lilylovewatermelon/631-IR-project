cook that shit up quay

verse 1
im back on
i invested in myself that mean im black owned
i did this from out the trenches thats my backbone
free lil bro he gone again he just came back home
make my money match my outfit i got racks on
had to cut off all the leeches tryna latch on
watch my man run up 200 off a trap phone
bet my dogs handle the business ima rap on
we put dicks inside our glizzys call em strap ons
if you ever disrespectin you get slapped on
i done really ran my check up off of rap songs
everything i say no cap even with my hat on
got caught up in a blog i was with a redbone
then i plead the fifth put on my headphones
lookin at my bitch i know im dead wrong
ima keep this pimpin til my headstone
still talking in codes on the jail phone
tryna say lil bruh a rat but who he tell on
just whatever with whoever how we gon come
dont play in no band but we got sticks and drums they go dumdumdum

chorus
hoppin out the bentley truck we known for actin stupid
yesterday went 4x4 today im finna coupe it
i put diamonds on my neck and wrist and even on my tooth
got the penthouse at the top the helicopter on the roof
told lil bruh dont take his ski mask off he just might have to shoot fafa
i aint fuckin with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie
told lil bruh dont take his ski mask off he just might have to shoot fafa
i aint fuckin with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie

chorus
hoppin out the bentley truck we known for actin stupid
yesterday went 4x4 today im finna coupe it

got the penthouse at the top the helicopter on the roof
told lil bruh dont take his ski mask off he just might have to shoot fafa
i aint fuckin with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie
told lil bruh dont take his ski mask off he just might have to shoot fafa
i aint fuckin with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie2embed"
