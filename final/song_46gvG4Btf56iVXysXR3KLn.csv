i want to say hi to you
i have no reason to
but i thought of you while driving today
with louis on the radio
i remembered how you loved him so
wed play his records dance real slow

verse 2
i guess
that im missing you
i know its out of the blue
i havent thought of you for more than weeks
now im dreaming of the moonlight glow
on your little studio
we both knew i had to go away

bridge
away to a place
much bigger than this
away from the land of fish and sea
to something new a skyline view
four thousand three hundred miles from you

verse 3
its complicated
you are my hometown love
moved to the city of
angels and i wish that you were hеre
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
now im in my empty studio
dont dare to call dont darе to know
if you want to say hello to me

outro
now im dreaming of your moonlight glow
from my empty studio
hoping that youll say hello to meembed"
