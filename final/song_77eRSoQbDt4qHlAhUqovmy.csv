better than watching geller bending silver spoons
better than witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom
she who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

prechorus
i havent felt the way i feel today
in so long its hard for me to specify
im beginning to notice
how much this feels like a waking limb
pins and needles nice to know you

chorus
goodbye nice to know you
goodbye nice to know you
goodbye nice to know you
goodbye nice to know you to know you

verse 2
deeper than the deepest cousteau would ever go
and higher than the heights of what we often think we know
blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
to obtain a birds eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze

prechorus
i havent felt the way i feel today
in so long its hard for me to specify
im beginning to notice
how much this feels like a waking limb
pins and needles nice to know you

could it be that it has been there all along

prechorus
i havent felt the way i feel today
in so long its hard for me to specify
im beginning to notice
how much this feels like a waking limb
pins and needles nice to know you

chorus
goodbye nice to know you
goodbye nice to know you
