this is a public service announcement this is only a test
emergency evacuation protest
may impair your ability to operate machinery
cant quite tell just what it means to me
keep out of reach of children dont you talk to strangers
get your philosophy from a bumper sticker

chorus
warnin live without warnin
i said warnin live without warnin
without alright

verse 2
better homes and safetysealed communities
did you remember to pay the utility
caution police line you better not cross
is the cop or am i the one thats really dangerous
sanitation expiration date question everything
or shut up and be a victim of authority

chorus
warnin live without warnin
i said warnin live without warnin
i said warnin live without warnin
i said warnin live without warnin
without alright
