rollin on up in our off road rider
sun sinking down stars getting brighter
fireflies dancing like free fall lighters
set the mood for a good time nighter
backwoods boys cant stop watching
them little hips swaying swaying
rocking and dropping
bumping cans spilling tripping slipping and popping
you know us you know we aint stopping

chorus
raise up your cup come on drink it up
keep the party sparking like the moon stuck
we aint going nowhere
naw we just crazy kids and we aint got a care
heres to riding on the high life
a little puff and a hell yeah high five
the memories the laughs the girls the nights
the best friends buzzin on the best beers of our lives
yeah on the best beers of our lives

a little country jumpin out the radio
a little slow groove pull her in real close
victorias secret little smoke show
mmm damn how these country girls roll come on
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also likeraise up your cup come on drink it up
keep the party sparking like the moon stuck
we aint going nowhere
naw we just crazy kids and we aint got a care
heres to riding on the high life
a little puff and a hell yeah high five
the memories the laughs the girls the nights
the best friends buzzin on the best beers of our lives
yeah on the best beers of our lives

yeah these are our nights
we aint goin nowhere
our time young and we dont care
oh yeah here to a sweet ride on the high life
its such a sweet ride

so raise up your cup come on drink it up
lets keep this party sparking like the moon stuck
