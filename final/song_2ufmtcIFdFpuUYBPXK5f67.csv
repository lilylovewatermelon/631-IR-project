its crazy when
the thing you love the most is the detriment
let that sink in
you can think again
when the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
youre nothin but skin

prechorus
oh cause i keep diggin myself down deeper
i wont stop til i get where you are
i keep running i keep running i keep running

chorus
they say i may be making a mistake
i woulda followed all the way no matter how far
i know when you go down all your darkest roads
i woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
oh cause i keep diggin myself down deeper
i wont stop til i get where you are
i keep running when both my feet hurt
i wont stop til i get where you are
oh when you go down all your darkest roads
i woulda followed all the way to the graveyard no oh

verse 2
you look at me look at me
with eyes so dark dont know how you even see
you push right through me push right through me
its gettin real
you lock the door youre drunk at the steering wheel
and i cant conceal

oh cause ive been diggin myself down deeper
i wont stop til i get where you are
i keep running i keep running i keep running

chorus
they say i may be making a mistake
i woulda followed all the way no matter how far
i know when you go down all your darkest roads
i woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
oh cause i keep diggin myself down deeper
i wont stop til i get where you are
i keep running when both my feet hurt
i wont stop til i get where you are
oh when you go down all your darkest roads
i woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

oh its funny how
the warning signs can feel like theyre butterflies

chorus
oh cause i keep diggin myself down deeper
i wont stop til i get where you are
i keep running when both my feet hurt
i wont stop til i get where you are
oh when you go down all your darkest roads
i woulda followed all the way to the graveyard61embed"
