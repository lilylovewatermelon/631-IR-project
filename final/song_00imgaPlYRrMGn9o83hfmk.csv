oh
oh whats goin on
here we go again

verse 1
whats left of us
whats left of our lives
its only you its only me
its only us at the end of the night
i remember when you couldnt tell me a thing
now you talk so much it drives me insane here we go again
but you got you some great—
hmm so what can i say to you
but im off that had to fall back
you got everybody thinkin im all bad ah shit
you know the truth you lying on me
i was always holdin you down you know how we was rocking
you down maybe not here we go again

chorus
and what we see aint what it seems or feels girl
what is love whats that
love what is love

verse 2
would you believe it if i told you all about it
about how pressure just keep addin up addin up up
then we just get mad and fuck
we was livin fast as fuck fast as fuck
drugs dont get me high enough
all these people always lyin bout something

i know its niggas worse off
maybe my sense of reality is turned off who the fuck knows
i just make songs who am i to challenge how this shit goes
its sarcasm by the way ah shit
