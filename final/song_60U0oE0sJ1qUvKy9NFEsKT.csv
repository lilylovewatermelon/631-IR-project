she hit the door 655 sack full of groceries split down the side
can goods scattered all the way to the curb
look on her face saying dont say a word
so its me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
western sky all turning red
head on my shoulder she sighed and said

chorus
been gophering chauffeuring company chairman
coffee maker copy repairman
anymore there aint nothing i swear man that i dont do
been juggling struggling closing big deals
dancing backwards in high heels
just when it feels like i cant make it through
she said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

verse 2
she said the girl i was with the business degree probably wouldnt recognize me
i was gonna run the bank
i was gonna run the math
now all i want to run is a bubble bath
back then you know i had this plan
before all of this reality set in
here comes life boy ready or not
hey i wanted it all and thats what i got
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
because im gophering chauffeuring company chairman
coffee maker copy repairman
anymore there isn’t nothing i swear man that
i dont do
been juggling struggling closing big deals
dancing backwards in high heels
just when it feels like i cant make it through
she said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

chorus
she said im gophering chauffeuring company chairman
coffee maker copy repairman
anymore there isn’t nothing i swear man that i dont do
been juggling struggling closing big deals
dancing backwards in high heels
just when it feels like i cant make it through
she said it sure is nice to just be the woman the woman with you
