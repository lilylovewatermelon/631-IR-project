i fill your pillow case up with snakes
the man eating kind
though you call your self a woman
i doubt it they would mind

theres just one problem with my plan
you spend your nights with another man
no you dont rest your head with mine no more
ive gotta take my plot back to the drawing board

oh lately im a heart ache
ive a desperate plan in hand
so im a blueprint in the sand

you mentioned taking a holiday
and i recalled you couldnt swim
so i booked us scuba diving
off the north coast of belgium
oh my

of you sinking just like lead
but i never found you washed up on the shore
ive gotta take my plot back to the drawing board
oh my oh
