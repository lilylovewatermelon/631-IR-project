i wont stand in your way
let your hatred grow
and shell scream and shell shout and shell pray
and she had a name yeah she had a name

let your anger rise
and well fly and well fall and well burn
no one will recall no one will recall

and this is the last time ill forget you
i wish i could

look to the stars
let hope burn in your eyes
and well love and well hate and well die
all to no avail all to no avail

this is the last time ill abandon you
and this is the last time ill forget you
