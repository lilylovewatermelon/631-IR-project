my lover left at eight at night
the dark was heavier than life
set the scene but couldve sworn that i was fine
you left the window wide open
lying places i cant stand
put my foot down but you kept the upper hand

chorus
moving fast until it breaks
you left me weak and in a daze
feelin low on the highway

verse 2
cut me open steal my clothes
told me yes but god only knows
couldnt come but thats just how the way life goes
give me the boot now i cant hear
give me gifts then to turn to steel
made your bed cooked all day and i cant deal

prechorus
felt like seconds but they were hours
a fallen rose is just a flower
hand on my hip its just a waist
felt so right i cant erase
feelin low on the highway

im feelin low on the highway
im feelin low on the highway
iâ€™m feelin low on the highway2embed"
