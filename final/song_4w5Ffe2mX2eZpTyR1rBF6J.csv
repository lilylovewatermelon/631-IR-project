cant step in my way
head first in your love and dismay
its like beating the dead
another time or day
i cant stop going out of my head
whatever this could be id never know
i never said itd be the end all to be all
i hate you today
i cant find a way
dont drag me down now

chorus
goodbye
ive had enough frustration
i wont get stuck
goodbye
this dead end situation
its just not worth my time

verse 2
its no better today
i never thought it would end up this way
youve got something to say
youve got something to say
dont want to hear it if it gets in my way
all this confusion wondering so overwhelmed
all this illusion seems so clear
cant find conclusion disappointing evolution
not all things arent what they appear
so whats the point of this hell
i know you too well were running backwards
