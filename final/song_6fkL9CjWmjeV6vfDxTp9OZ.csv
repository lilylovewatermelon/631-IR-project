at the end of it all end of it all
no one wants to drink alone
baby thats how it goes
dont walk away from me

verse 1 thundercat
fragmented memories
sentences incomplete
thats when she said
dont wanna put up a fight anymore
im down to the end of my rope
and im freefalling
ill search inside myself
i need to know why i act this way
a whisper turns to a scream
i cant ignore it no more

chorus thundercat
at the end of it all end of it all
no one wants to drink alone
baby thats how it goes

verse 2 kendrick lamar
from my eyewitness binoculars uhhuh
to argentina and africa uhhuh
we mastered the what pressure yeah
hazardous uhhuh harassing us thats right
you laugh at us you did
more accurate at bagging dimes now we bagging rhymes
body bags price tags on your forehead
nine times out of ten young niggas are nine or ten
when the line becomes thin be a killer or fireman
fill up the lavish pen if i needed to right my wrongs
i cant deny sin condolences through these palms
i remember when your cousin was coming home
i bitched while we plotted to kill him cause we aint know him
unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
convicted court cases might hit the surface
restricted territories might come through lurkin
we aint want none of that urgent call
well ima act turk and fall on my identity percocets
and for all the headaches im bout to bring confetti
tumble out this barrel soon as it ring you ready
that was the word fore we moved on em
treat him like joe the plumber
i wonder if someone comin can see this tool on him
immature and retarded is what you call me
your cousin wasnt coming home from the pen but from the army
if i can right my wrongs and pen this verse i read
even though a bullet hit him in the leg still walk on by
