viceroy
early in the morning
just trying to let the sun in
and open up my eyes
viceroy
as its getting later
heading for the corner
already running dry

chorus
and oh dont let me see you crying
cause oh honey ill smoke you til im dying

verse 2
viceroy
dont take me for a fool now
im only trying to calm down
just trying to keep it cool
viceroy
as its getting later
heading for the corner
im leaving it to you

chorus
and oh dont let me see you crying
cause oh honey ill smoke you til im dying
