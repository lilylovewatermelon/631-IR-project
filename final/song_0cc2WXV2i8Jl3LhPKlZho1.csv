through the eyes of men it seems theres so much we have lost
as we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked
one by one the enemy has whispered lies and led them off as slaves

verse 2
but we know that you are god yours is the victory
we know there is more to come that we may not yet see
so with the faith youve given us we step into the valley unafraid yeah

chorus
as we call out to dry bones come alive come alive
we call out to dead hearts come alive come alive
up out of the ashes let us see an army rise
we call out to dry bones come alive

verse 3
god of endless mercy god of unrelenting love
rescue every daughter bring us back the wayward sons
and by your spirit breathe upon them
show the world that you alone can save
you alone can save

chorus
as we call out to dry bones come alive come alive

up out of the ashes let us see an army rise
