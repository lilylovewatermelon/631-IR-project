verse 1
your lipstick stains
on the front lobe of my leftside brains
i knew i wouldnt forget you
and so i went and let you blow my mind
your sweet moonbeam
the smell of you in every single dream i dream
i knew when we collided
youre the one i have decided whos one of my kind

chorus
hey soul sister
aint that mr mister on the radio stereo
the way you move aint fair you know
hey soul sister
i dont want to miss a single thing you do
tonight

interlude

im so glad you have a onetrack mind like me

my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
i believe in you like a virgin youre madonna
and im always gonna wanna blow your mind

chorus
hey soul sister
aint that mr mister on the radio stereo

watching yous the only drug i need

i can be myself now finally
in fact theres nothing i cant be
i want the world to see you be with me
chorus
