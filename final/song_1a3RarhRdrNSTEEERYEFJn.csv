looks like ima do everything myself
maybe i could use some help
but hell you want somethin done right
you gotta do it yourself
maybe life is up and down
but my lifes been what til now
i crawled up your butt from hell
and thats when things got turned around
it used to be a lie i used to feel pathetic and now i get it
whats done is done you just leave it alone and dont regret it
sometimes some things turn into dumb things
and thats when you put your foot down

chorus
why did i have to go and meet somebody like you like you
why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me like me
how could you do somebody like that like that
hope you know that im never comin back never comin back

its all just more giving to you and im done
