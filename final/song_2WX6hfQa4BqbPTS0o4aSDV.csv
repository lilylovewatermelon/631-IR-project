i am heaven sent
dont you dare forget
i am all youve ever wanted
what all the other boys all promised
sorry i told
i just needed you to know
i think in decimals and dollars
i am the cause to all your problems
shelter from cold
we are never alone
coordinate brain and mouth
then ask me what its like to have myself so figured out
i wish i knew

verse 2
i hope this song starts a craze
the kinda song that ignites the airwaves
the kinda song that makes people glad to be where they are
with whoever theyre there with
this is war
every line is about who i dont wanna write about anymore
hope you come down with something they cant diagnose
dont have the cure for
holding on to your grudge
oh its so hard to have someone to love
and keeping quiet is hard
cause you cant keep a secret
if it never was a secret to start
at least pretend you didnt wanna get caught
you might also likechorus
were concentrating on falling apart
we were contenders were throwing the fight
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
in us

verse 3
oh were so ccccccontroversial
we are entirely smooth
we admit to the truth
we are the best at what we do
and these are the words you wish you wrote down
this is the way you wish your voice sounds
handsome and smart
oh my tongues the only muscle on my body
that works harder than my heart
and its all from watching tv
and from speeding up my breathing
wouldnt stop if i could
oh it hurts to be this good
youre holding on to your grudge
oh it hurts to always have to be
honest with the one that you love
oh so let it go
chorus
were concentrating on falling apart
we were contenders were throwing the fight
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
were concentrating on falling apart
we were contenders were throwing the fight
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
in us

bridge
this is the grace only we can bestow
this is the price you pay for loss of control
this is the break in the bend
this is the closest of calls
this is the reason youre alone
this is the rise and the fall

chorus
were concentrating on falling apart
we were contenders were throwing the fight
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
were concentrating on falling apart
we were contenders were throwing the fight
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
i just wanna believe
