there is a door to me
ive never seen it
sometimes i get closer to it
but ive never found it
at twilight i almost had it
but then the night fell
i looked out at the dark and wondered
how could i have lost it

verse 2
then one night at the park i saw it
with my cheek in the dirt
i couldnt move underneath the dark
but at least i finally found it
cried out a creak and opened
to show me whats beyond it
a hopeless violence
i named it lovesee mitski liveget tickets as low as 55you might also like12embed"
