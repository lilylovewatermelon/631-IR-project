rare is this love keep it covered
i need you to run to me run to me lover
run until you feel your lungs bleeding

verse 1
oh but the farrow know
her hungry eye her ancient soul
its carried by the sneering menagerie
know what it is to grow
beneath her sky a punishing cold
to slowly learn of her ancient misery
to be twisted by something
a shame without a sin
like how she twisted the bog man
after she married him

chorus
rare is this love keep it covered
i need you to run to me run to me lover
run until you feel your lungs bleeding

verse 2
but in all the world
there is one lover worthy of her
with as many souls claimed as she
but for all hes worth
he still shatters always on her earth
the cause of every tear shed ever weep
rushing to shore to meet her
foaming with loneliness
white hands to fondle and beat her
give her his onliness
