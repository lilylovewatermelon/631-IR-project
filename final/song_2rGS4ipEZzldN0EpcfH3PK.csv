when the sun is rising over streets so barren
since the evening colors flash before my eyes
i feel like a child so young and new in 92
i listened to what my father said

chorus
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall
there is a voice inside us all
so smile when you can when you can

verse 2
how this used to feel so far and free
now these broken souls are all i see
fists have fallen to our side
we may cry alone i feel we know where all of this is headed
but my mama said

chorus
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
oh i nah nah nah
if you are strong you cannot fall
if you are strong oh no
there is a voice inside us all
so smile ohh when you can ohh when you can

if you cannot oh
there is more to you and me
there is more than they can see
im on your side woo oh
there is more out there
and somebody cares bout you

interlude
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall
there is more out there
keep all your dreams keep standing tall
if you are strong you cannot fall

outro

when theyre gone keep to yourself

if you are strong you cannot fall

if you are strong you cannot fall
thanks for doing that thank you
