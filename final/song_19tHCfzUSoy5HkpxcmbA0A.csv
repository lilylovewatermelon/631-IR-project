i used to think one day wed tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say theyre the lucky ones
i used to know my place was the spot next to you
now im searching the room for an empty seat
cause lately i dont even know what page youre on

prechorus
oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up i cant break through

chorus
now im standin alone in a crowded room
and were not speakin
and im dyin to know
is it killin you like its killin me yeah
i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

postchorus
next chapter
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeverse 2
howd we end up this way
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and youre doin your best to avoid me
im starting to think one day ill tell the story of us
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you shouldve held me

prechorus
oh im scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothin
id tell you i miss you but i dont know how
ive never heard silence quite this loud

chorus
now im standin alone in a crowded room
and were not speakin
and im dyin to know
is it killin you like its killin me yeah
i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

bridge
this is lookin like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battles in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you said youd rather love than fight
prechorus
so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon

chorus
now im standin alone in a crowded room
and were not speakin
and im dyin to know
is it killin you like its killin me yeah
and i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
and were not speakin
and im dyin to know
is it killin you like its killin me yeah
i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
cause were going down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
