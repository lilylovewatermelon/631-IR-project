gather round this table boys
bring your shame ill lose my voice
screaming at the gods about the bad weve done
merle said mama tried but the prison still won

verse 2
your transgressions are mine as well
anger grows in my bones if you could not tell
but ill find comfort in company
lord forgive us my boys and me

chorus
were having an allnight revival
someone call the women and someone steal the bible
for the sake of my survival
baptize me in a bottle of beam put johnny on the vinyl

verse 2
well the devil can scrap but the lord has won
and ill talk to him under risin sun
his son rose and mine did too
i was coming down but now im talkin to you

chorus
cause were having an allnight revival
someone call the women and someone steal the bible
for the sake of my survival
baptize me in a bottle of beam put johnny on the vinyl
