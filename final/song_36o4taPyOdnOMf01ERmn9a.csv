you want me to give you a testimony about my life
and how good hes been to me
i dont know what to tell you about him
i love him so much with all my heart and my soul
with every bone in my body i love him so much
because hes done so much for me
every morning
every day of my life
i wont always be crying tears
in the middle of the night and i wont always have to wake up
by myself wondering how im gonna get through the day
i wont always have to think about what im gonna do
and how im gonna how im gonna make it
how im gonna get there because he
hes gonna be there for me
someday the sky above will open up
and he will reach out his hand and guide me through
oh yes he will
i wont always be crying these tears
i wont always be feeling so blue
someday he will open up the door for me
and call my name
someday he will
i dont know if anybody understands what that feels like
no matter what youve been through
or where youve been hes always there
with his arms open wide
accepting me
for who i am
and i love him so much
i couldnt do it without him i wouldnt want to
oh im crying now
feels so good to be free
to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
oh lord thank you
you are the joy of my lifesee kanye west liveget tickets as low as 122you might also like21embed"
