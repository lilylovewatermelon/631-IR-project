there are certain people you just keep coming back to
she is right in front of you
you begin to wonder could you find a better one
compared to her now shes in question

prechorus
and all at once the crowd begins to sing
sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

chorus
maybe you want her maybe you need her
maybe you started to compare to someone not there

verse 2
looking for the right one you line up the world to find
where no questions cross your mind
but she wont keep on waiting for you without a doubt
much longer for you to sort it out

prechorus
and all at once the crowd begins to sing
sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

chorus
maybe you want her maybe you need her
maybe you started to compare to someone not there
maybe you want it maybe you need it
maybe its all youre running from
perfection will not come

and all at once the crowd begins to sing
sometimes
wed never know whats wrong without the pain
sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same

chorus
maybe you want her maybe you need her
maybe you started to compare to someone not there
maybe you want it maybe you need it
maybe its all youre running from
perfection will not come

outro
maybe you want her maybe you need her
maybe you had her maybe you lost her to another
