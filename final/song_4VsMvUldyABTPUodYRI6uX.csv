ive never been the kind that youd call lucky
always stumblin around in circles
but i mustve stumbled into something
look at me
am i really alone with you
i wake up feeling like my lifes worth living
cant recall when i last felt that way
i guess it must be all this love youre giving
never knew never knew it could be like this
but i guess

some hearts have the stars on their side
some hearts
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
some hearts just get lucky lucky sometimes

verse 2
now whod have thought someone like you could love me
youre the last thing my heart expected
whod have thought id ever find somebody
someone who someone who makes me feel like this
