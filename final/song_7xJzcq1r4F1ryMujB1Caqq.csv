my lucks on the game cant find a way through
dont know how many times i had to say this to you
this aint my scene this werent my dream
it was all yours of course
i got caught up in this game
and you know i wont say names of whos to blame

ill let life take its time and in time youll see the truth
i wont ask any questions i wont say it was you
ill let life take its time and in time youll see the truth
