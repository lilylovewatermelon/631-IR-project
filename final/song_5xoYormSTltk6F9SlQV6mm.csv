i choose me

verse 1 kendrick lamar
the pressures taking over me its beginning to loom
better if i spare your feelings and tell you the truth
lately i redirected my point of view
you wont grow waitin on me
i cant live in the matrix huh
rather fall short of your graces huh
this time i wont trade places huh
not about whos right whos wrong huh
evolve the only thing known huh
ask me when im coming home huh
blink twice again im gone

chorus kendrick lamar
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry

verse 2 kendrick lamar
she woke up in the morning for the daily news
i was so low and mourning through the family feuds
baby i told you a story and laid down all the rules
still you wont grow waiting on me

verse 3 kendrick lamar
cause all of its toxic
girl im not relevant to givin on profit
personal gain off my pain its nonsense
darlin my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
baby i just had a baby you know she need me
workin on myself the counselin is not easy
dont you point a finger just to point a finger
cause critical thinkin is a dealbreaker
faith in one man is a ship sinking
do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
she told me that she need me the most i didnt believe her
she even called me names on the post the world can see it
jokes and gaslightin
mad at me cause she didnt get my vote she say im triflin
disregardin the way that i cope with my own vices
maybe its time to break it off
run away from the culture to follow my heart
bridge kendrick lamar
i realized true loves not savin face
but unconditional
when will you let me go
i trust youll find independence
if not then all is forgiven
sorry i didnt save the world my friend
i was too busy buildin mine again

chorus kendrick lamar
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry
i choose me im sorry60embed"
