this is how i look without makeup
and with no bra my ninnys sag down low
my hair aint never hung down to my shoulders
and it might not grow
you never know
but im clever when i bust a rhyme
im cleva always on ya mind
shes cleva and i really wanna grow
but why come youre the last to know

i got a little pot in my belly
so now a days my figure aint so fly
my dress aint cost nothin but seven dollars
but i made it fly
and ill tell you why

but im clever when i bust a rhyme
im cleva always on ya mind
shes cleva and i really wanna grow
but why come im the last to know
