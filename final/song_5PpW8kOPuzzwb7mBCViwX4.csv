i saw you there last night
standing in the dark
you were acting so in love
with your hand upon his heart

chorus
but you were just friends
at least thats what you said
now i know better from his fingers in your hair
i forgive you for what youve done
if you say that im the one

verse 2
ive had other options too
but all i want is you
girl your body fits me like a glove
and you shower me with words of love

chorus
while you were just friends
at least thats what you said
now i know better from his fingers in your hair
i forgive you for what youve done
if you say that im the one
