when i come up in the club
i’m talkin’ mad shit
come up in the club
i’m ‘bout to get my ass kicked
‘cause i’m sippin’ on some gin
sipsippin’ on some jack
slip 60 in her panties with my number on the back

prechorus
‘cause the proof is in the kodak
the throwbacks in a dark and vacant corner
you were freezing i was warmer
and the roof is blown you know that
and baby chases like she don’t know what she’s seeing
i was steady you were fleeting

chorus
punkbitch ‘cause i’ve seen it before
punkbitch and i don’t care anymore
punkbitch and i just want you to know

you put my picture in a box
it was the one inside your locket
what happened to the keys
that used to jingle in your pocket
your fingers say to come
but your eyes say i should stop it
if i regret all i’ve done
i would be trapped inside that locket
you put my picture in a box
it was the one inside your locket woahoh woahoh oh
what happened to the keys
that used to jingle in your pocket woahoh woahoh oh
your fingers say to come
but your eyes say i should stop it woahoh woahoh oh
if i regret all i’ve done
i would be trapped inside that locket woahoh woahoh oh
you put my picture in a box ‘cause i’ve seen it before
it was the one inside your locket
what happened to the keys and i don’t care anymore
that used to jingle in your pocket
your fingers say to come and i just want you to know
but your eyes say i should stop it
if i regret all i’ve done
i would be trapped inside that locket
that we datin’ mad models and poppin’ mad bottles tonightembed"
