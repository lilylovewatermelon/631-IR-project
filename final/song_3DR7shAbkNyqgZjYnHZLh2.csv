i cant hold your hand this time

chorus
im the crème de la crème and its filled to the brim
but you should still go be with him
i cant hold your hand this time

cause whats a nine to a dime piece
whats a headache to a youngin tryna find peace
whats one girl to a couple siamese ooh
whats a chase when they down to come and find me find me ayy

told me this aint really my scene
well baby this is my party and the drinks all free
so have a good time its on me why
