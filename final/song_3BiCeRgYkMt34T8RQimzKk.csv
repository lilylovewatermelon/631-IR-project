baby i know that youve been waiting patiently
for a man to give you all that you need
and love you like he should
sticking to your guns looking for the right one
just somebody who treats you good
it took me a while but i got here as fast as i could

chorus
i ran full speed ahead
without stopping to rest
not knowing where i was running too
now that im here
its perfectly clear
that i was making my way to you
cant believe how long it took
but i got here as fast as i

verse 2
ive ended up on at least 100 dead end roads
where my heart and i just end up broke
lost and misunderstood
i tried to rush finding true love
it didnt pan out how i thought it would
it took me some time
but i got here as fast as i could
