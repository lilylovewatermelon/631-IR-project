verse 1 craig david
now i know that weve been trippin for some time
its been real hard but i know that we been playin
tryna figure out why you changed whats on your mind
but it seems recently that
yacting like it dont matter
so i
call my boy tinchy stryder
he said to me
maybe i should just move on
with my life
and id be so better off on my own

bridge craig david
i could be scopin out
checking out other ladies at this party
all loud we dont really wanna leave without the flyest hottie
wining up thought i might cruelly step beside me
but i aint bout to hurt nobody
aint bout to lose what we got

verse 2 craig david
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
pullin up to the club
where all the ladies are waitin

and im not messin around headin straight to the floor
and the djs got this crowd callin out for more

if only we could rewind
and find this love girl wed be fine
