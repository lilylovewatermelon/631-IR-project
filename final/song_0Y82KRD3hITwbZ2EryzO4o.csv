young boy used to drown in that alcohol
and if you dialing 517 fore you fucking call
im out the hall k2 to my fuckin jaw
when waking up and gettin cash was a fuckin chore
aluminum pays so we packin up the fuckin car
cold nights tanqueray up in the fuckin jar
ride slide feel the ice up on the fuckin road
white jeep white trash white fuckin snow
i remember everything like last year was yesterday
used to set up rupture funds and make that money anyway
then we knew how they wont ever find out how we did these things thats just how it went down

chorus
tables by the stack thumb tacks by the pack
gasoline with the rag it went way beyond the matte
