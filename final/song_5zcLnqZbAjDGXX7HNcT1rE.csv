so sick of the hobos
always begging for change
i dont like how i gotta work
and they just sit around and get paid
i hate all of the people
who cant drive their cars
bitch you better get out of the way
before i start falling apart
i hate how my wife
is always up my ass
she always wants to buy brand new things
but i dont have the cash

chorus
i hate my job all of my rich friends
i hate everyone to the bitter end
nothing turns out right theres no end in sight
i hate my life

verse 2
how come i never get laid
nice guys always lose
how could she have another headache
theres always some kind of excuse
i still hate my job my boss is a dick
i dont get paid nearly enough to put up with all of his shit

verse 3
i hate that i cant tell
when a girls underage
you know i tell her shes a nice piece of ass
then her daddy punches me in the face
so if youre pissed like me
this is what you gotta do
put your middle fingers up in the air
go on and say fuck you

chorus

so much at stake cant catch a break
i hate my life
no its nothing new
hear it sucks to be you
i fuckin hate my life
