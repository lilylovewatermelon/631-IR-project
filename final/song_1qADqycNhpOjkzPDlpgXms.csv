me and jb and sonny we grew up on the buddy plan
werent we some bad mothers closer than brothers
had a rocking little threepiece band
yeah we wrote a lot of songs about women
then we tried to sing them pretty for the girls
pushing everything we did to the limit
living right out on the edge of the world

verse 2
i recall on summer night at a party
we were sophomores hanging out by the lake
i got off on some wine with a waitress
sonny had a girlfriend that just couldnt wait
jb hooked up around midnight
with an ugly girl from up in the city
he downed every can of beer in the cooler
just trying to drink that poor thing pretty

chorus
hey me and the boys we made a lot of noise
and we sang all our songs for free
we partied through college acquired some knowledge
never did get a degree
we did it our way looking back on the good days
theres still not a lot i regret
nights i cant remember friends ill never forget

i grew up and got married took a job with the fpl
sonnys got a good life a baby and a good wife
and everyday he carries the mail
jb is a crosscountry trucker
and he called last night from south carolina
he said i fallen in love with a waitress
that i met at a waffle house diner

bridge
he said the years seem to roll on faster
than they did back when we were kids
then we need us a break from the grindstone
thats exactly what we did

verse 4
we put in a phone call to sonny
then we stayed out all night long
we drank a few cold ones then told a few old ones
and sang another verse to the song

chorus
yeah we were boys who made a lot of noise
and we sang all our songs for free
we partied through college acquired some knowledge
never did get a degree
we did it our way looking back on the good days
theres still not a lot i regret
theres some nights i cant remember friends ill never forget
outro
all those nights i cant remember friends ill never forgetembed"
