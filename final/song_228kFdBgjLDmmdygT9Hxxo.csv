pour a drink and take a sip of it
feelin like a hypocrite
couple more and i wont give a shit
i never used to talk i never used to talk like this

verse 1
im sorry i named the album montevallo
and im sorry people know your name now
and strangers hit you up on social media
im sorry you cant listen to the radio
and drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in pelham
i know you want your privacy
and you got nothing to say to me
but i wish youd let me pay off your student loans
with these songs you gave to me
member the first time you stayed with me
overpacked and drove up and went to the cmas with me
two years later it felt like you were a million miles away from me
and i was the one on stage drunk barely holdin on on abc
hope your dad still prays for me

chorus
drinkin too much drinkin too much
since you been gone i cant get gone enough
im on top of the world goin down
im gon drink it all til youre not around
drinkin too much drinkin too much
since you been gone i cant get gone enough
im on top of the world im goin down
im gon drink it all til youre not around

a year ago i was in a hotel room in phoenix
wonderin if its ever okay to lie
cause i knew the truth would make you wanna die
but i told you everything and you told me to have a good life
but you still couldnt believe it was really goodbye
every night youd fill the bathtub up
lie there for hours put your face under water and cry
i never wanted to be a heartbreaker
turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
i know you think my dreams came true
since you been gone singin these songs are just something to do
the only dream i ever had was you
i hope you know im still in love
its the kind that you cant fall out of

chorus
drinkin too much drinkin too much
since you been gone i cant get gone enough
im on top of the world goin down
im gon drink it all til youre not around
drinkin too much drinkin too much
since you been gone i cant get gone enough
im on top of the world im goin down
im gon drink it all til youre not around
now its almost gone
verse 3
i know this might seem like a contradiction
and the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
but you changed your number and moved
and this is the only way i could reach you
so wherever you are turn it up and listen

outro
hannah lee im on my way to you
nobody can love you like i do
i dont know what im gon say to you
but i know there aint no way know there aint no way
know there aint no way were through3embed"
