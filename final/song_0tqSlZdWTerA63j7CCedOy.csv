there really is no such thing as good or bad

what is reality
what is reality

what i thought was unreal now
seems in some ways to be more real

these are questions of how the world feels to us

what is reality

there is no out there out there
independent of whats going on in here

its just disguising the negative

the real trick to life is not to be in the know
but to be in the now

our thoughts can affect our reality

what is reality

there is something very real about this presence
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likeits just disguising the negative

the real trick to life is not to be in the know
but to be in the now

weve gone inside of your head
weve gone into every orifice you have to find something called an observer
and theres nobody home
theres nobody in the brain
theres nobody in the cortical regions of the brain
theres nobody in the subcortical regions or the limbic regions of the brain
theres nobody there

the deepest level of truth
is the truth of unity

what is reality
what is reality
what is realityembed"
