could not believe came here today
helmet was on you blew me away
house is on fire were naked again
maybe all we need is water and friends
shackles and chains wont keep me away
temple is you and my brow is insane

chorus
i wanna be just like you
i wanna feel right through you
i wanna see just with you
i wanna live i wanna die you

verse 2
thinning ice fourteen hairdryers
im swimming to you flame on earth desire
poor on the rise rich on the fall
this cripples with you fame is a whore

chorus
i wanna be just like you
i wanna feel right through you
i wanna see just with you
i wanna live i wanna die you
i wanna fit inside you
i wanna room inside you
if money talks i wanna buy you
i wanna die i wanna die
i wanna live you
see bush liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likebridge
im not scared of you could give up on drugs
if i make it through the jaws of love
the jaws of love
your hand in my hand
for why i found

chorus
i wanna be just like you
i wanna feel right through you
i wanna see just with you
i wanna die
i wanna live you
i wanna fit inside you
i wanna room inside you
if money talks if money talks
if money talks if money talks

outro
you give and you give and you give
you give and you give and you give
you give and you give and you give
you give and you give and you give and
you give and you give and you give and
you give and you give and you give and
you give and you give and you give and youembed"
