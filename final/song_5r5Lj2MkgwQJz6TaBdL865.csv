i am the one you left for dead
say you want it too
you are the bullet in my head
and as you stand over my grave
tell me its okay
your porcelain lips upon my face

prechorus
either im in heaven or im in hell
am i losing my mind here cause i cant tell
ive been waiting for answers for way too long
seems im always waiting around

chorus
spiders in my head spiders in my mind
you may take my eyes but baby im not blind
it all works out in time
you know im gonna be alright
you may take my eyes but baby im not blind

postchorus
talk to me now

verse 2
i think your mother wants me dead
say you want it too
i am a schizophrenic man
i wouldnt change you if i could
say you want me too
treat me cold ill play it cool
