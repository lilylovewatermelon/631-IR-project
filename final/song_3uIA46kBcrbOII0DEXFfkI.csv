what has become of all of us all ceilings all skies
is that the stars can swim a thousand dark miles
before they ever see the floor again

prechorus
with their backs against the wall on these last days
but then we knew that would happen anyway

chorus
you drop that pitchblack pall
over us one and all again
to propel your national machines
giving us all the disease but not the vaccine

verse 2
a thousand tiny lives
disappear into the black stretch
and i guess i thought id feel something but i didnt
but i didnt yes thats a myth

prechorus
with their backs against the wall on these last days
but then we knew that would happen anyway

chorus
you drop that pitchblack pall
over us one and all again
to propel your national machines
giving us all the disease but not the vaccine

i would give anything for a cool glass of water
without this poisonous oil

outro

no its never gonna be good enough
no its never gonna be good enough
