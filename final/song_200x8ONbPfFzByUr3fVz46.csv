heads carolina tails california

verse 1
i was out with the boys catchin up in a neon light
didnt know til we walked in it was karaoke night
she was in a circle of girls chasin a shot with a lime
she was laughin they were darin her to get on the mic
one of em walked up and turned in her name
next thing i knew man she was up on the stage singin

chorus
heads carolina tails california
maybe shed fall for a boy from south georgia
shes got the bar in the palm of her hand
and shes a 90s country fan like i am
hey i got a chevy she can flip a quarter
id drive hеr anywhere from herе to california
when this song is over i gotta find her
cause she had me at heads carolina

verse 2
yeah she knew every word by heart didnt need no screen no
i was raisin my glass up for her i saw her smilin at me yeah
she had me down in the front by the end of verse two
like there wasnt no one else in the room we were singin
