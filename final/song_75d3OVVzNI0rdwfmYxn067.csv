oh oh
i tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet
the light that shines will redefine your old beliefs
what you reap is what you sow and so it goes
where you plant your needs is where your garden grows
before you think about yourself
think of someone else it will make you feel
each day arent wine and roses
i doubt its meant to be
always a cross to bear salvation dont come free
a heart that beats is a heart that bleeds
and you know thats true
so dont deny yourself of something good for you
before you do it for yourself do it for someone else
that makes it real

chorus
because when you love someone
it dont matter what you say
when you love someone
you will dance the night away
when you love someone
there arent nothing you cant do
isnt that right
yeah i want to love someone tonight
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeverse 2
will you believe in love or just sit around and judge
can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge
because above selfishness there lies a bright blue sky
and wealth and happiness can be a long and lonesome ride
yes its hard to steer yourself
without that someone else to take the wheel
take the wheel

chorus
because when you love someone
it dont matter what you say
when you love someone
you will dance the night away
when you love someone
there arent nothing you cant do
isnt that right
yeah i want to love someone tonight

verse 3
do you believe in the art of growing old
do you believe that rock and roll can save your soul
do you believe in everything you do
because when you do thats when it all comes back to you
before you think about yourself
think of someone else
do it for yourself
and do it for someone else
outro
when you love someoneembed"
