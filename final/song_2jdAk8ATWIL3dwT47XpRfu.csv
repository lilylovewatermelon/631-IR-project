its not a silly little moment
its not the storm before the calm
this is the deep and dying breath of
this love that weve been working on
cant seem to hold you like i want to
so i can feel you in my arms
nobodys going to come and save you
we pulled too many false alarms

chorus
were going down
and you can see it too
were going down
and you know that were doomed
my dear were slow dancing in a burning room

verse 2
i was the one you always dreamed of
you were the one i tried to draw
how dare you say its nothing to me
baby youre the only light i ever saw
ill make the most of all the sadness
youll be a bitch because you can
you try to hit me just to hurt me
so you leave me feeling dirty
cause you cant understand
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
were going down
and you can see it too
were going down
and you know that were doomed
my dear were slow dancing in a burning room

bridge
go cry about it why dont you
go cry about it why dont you
go cry about it why dont you

chorus
my dear were slow dancing in a burning room
burning room
burning room
burning room
burning room

outro
dont you think we ought to know by now
dont you think we should have learned somehow
dont you think we ought to know by now
dont you think we should have learned somehow
dont you think we ought to know by now
dont you think we should have learned somehow54embed"
