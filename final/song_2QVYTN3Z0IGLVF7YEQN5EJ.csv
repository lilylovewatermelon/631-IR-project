verse 3 kendrick lamar
as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
im dying inside i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a mac11
thats all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but im right on the edge of everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice
well its probably you am i right if im wrong you a fucking liar
when i lie on my back and look at the ceiling its so appealing to pray
i wonder if im just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
i give em back they deposit no money just total silence
im running they say im wildin a youngin with lack of guidance
thats hundreds of us with problems
mo money mo drugs and violence
look at the soul of an outofcontrol artist
thats dealing with life the hardest thats on my life
but regardless imaâ€”

verse 4 bj the chicago kid
yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure
i lost one of my biggest believers aww
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had that same chance twice what would i do different
id tell her i loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when im done recording
swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers
dont take too much smoke from the reefer
love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it family having surgeries
hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
lord what kind of life is this
momma i just wanna sing
momma said according to get everything uh
you gotta risk everything
so im smoking my kush reading corinthians
smoking my kush reading corinthians
smoking my kush reading corinthians corinthians
ohoh ohoh
