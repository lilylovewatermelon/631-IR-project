i see you i do
your hands are guiding for who you are to love you
i am not sorry for what i do
my soul sits tidy in my being
im allseeing allfeeling allcreating

chorus
i feel so much love through you
you not so be in my dream
i saw you asleep

verse 2
you make me feel like a cloud of h20
baby ive seen you before
youre dancing softly oh what do i know
oh yeah im dancing for sure
im dancing for sure
i dont see you often what do i know
needing you in the astral realms
i can call your dorm room right from my labradorite
i know you dont think im the right one
but all of these energies light
and im just trying to get like one get like one

chorus
i feel so much love through you
you not so be in my dream
i saw you asleep
