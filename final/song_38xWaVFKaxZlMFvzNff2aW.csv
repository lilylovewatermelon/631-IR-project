im still alive but im barely breathing
just praying to a god that i dont believe in
cause i got time while she got freedom
cause when a heart breaks no it dont break even

verse 1
her best days will be some of my worst
she finally met a man thats gonna put her first
while im wide awake shes no trouble sleeping
cause when a heart breaks no it dont breakeven even no

chorus
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you
and what am i supposed to say when im all choked up and youre ok
im falling to pieces yeah
im falling to pieces

verse 2
they say bad things happen for a reason
but no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
cause shes moved on while im still grieving
and when a heart breaks no it dont breakeven even even no

chorus
what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you
and what am i supposed to say when im all choked up and youre ok
im falling to pieces yeah
