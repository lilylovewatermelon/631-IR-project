i could see me sittin in the back of a cop car bangin my head on a window
i could see me slammin that last call shot glass losin everything in my billfold
ooh ooh
thats what i do when im drinkin bout you

chorus
so i dont wanna go downtown doin what we used to
twist the top off another round hell i got enough loose screws
i’m gettin tired of hurtin bout you
nothin ever changes
i think im gonna stay right here tonight
cause that could be dangerous
cause that could be dangerous

verse 2
yeah i could see me doin just fine with a daisy duke dime but i dont see it lastin long
i could see me orderin too many drinks at the bar
get the bartender pourin em strong
thats what i do when im tryna drink you gone

chorus
so i dont wanna go downtown doin what we used to
twist the top off another round hell i got enough loose screws
i’m gettin tired of hurting bout you
nothin ever changes
i think im gonna stay right here tonight
cause that could be dangerous
cause that could be dangerous
