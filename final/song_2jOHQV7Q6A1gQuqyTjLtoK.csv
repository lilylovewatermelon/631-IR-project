life is a canvas im painting in my mind
colors dance spill outside the lines
i refuse to settle never the black and white
rock the neons until the day i die
im on a constant search to make my heart swell
bite off too much chew like hell
half my nights spent in a hotel
price i pay to escape the conveyor belt

prechorus
one you get one heartbeat some
take it seriously

chorus
this is your masterpiece
dont forget to dream and taste the colors
in the air you breathe
its your masterpiece
go ahead and feel it all
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful

verse 2
close my eyelids take a deep breath
feel the lightning down in my chest
im just a piece of art and the paints fresh
cause im not near finished yet
i got a pregnant mind that wants to give birth
breathe life into these big words
i can hear the universe in my ear she whispers
you might also likeprechorus
one you get one heartbeat some
take it seriously

chorus
this is your masterpiece
dont forget to dream and taste the colors
in the air you breathe
its your masterpiece
go ahead and feel it all
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful

bridge
and you can settle for the normal life
say youre afraid of heights
but you were meant to light the sky

chorus
this is your masterpiece
dont forget to dream and taste the colors
in the air you breathe
its your masterpiece
go ahead and feel it all
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful
dont stop till it is beautiful1embed"
