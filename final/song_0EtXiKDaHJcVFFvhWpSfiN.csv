centuries passed and still the same
war in our blood some things never change
fighting for land and personal gain
better your life justify your pain
the end is knocking the end is knocking

chorus m shadows  the rev
weve all been lost for most of this life
lost for most of this life
everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
and i know that most of us just aint right
most of us just aint right
following the wrong steps being led by pride

verse 2 m shadows
how many lives will we take
how many hearts destined to break
nowhere to run cant escape
full of ourselves tied to our fate
the end is knocking the end is knocking yeah

chorus m shadows  the rev
weve all been lost for most of this life
lost for most of this life
everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
and i know that most of us just aint right
most of us just aint right
following the wrong steps being led by pride

with peace of mind so hard to find
were dwelling on the drastic signs
another way to numb our mind
and as you close your eyes tonight and pray for a better life
youll see it flying helplessly away

and i know that most of us just aint right
most of us just aint right
following the wrong steps being led by pride
