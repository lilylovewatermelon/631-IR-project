i rode a horse named whiskey i thought i could trust
til she pinned her ears back and just like a whip crack
she left me in the dust
i was cruisin on my harley enjoyin the breeze
i got hit head on and thrown
lord knows it shouldve killed me

chorus
every scar has a story and it leaves its mark
guess you could say im the king of takin things way too far
and i thought i knew pain
aint nothin i aint been through
but when i met you girl i fell hard
every scar has a story just ask my heart

verse 2
i remember that mornin i saw your face
turnin down a side street
somethin inside me said dont let her get away
and those nights that followed they still haunt me
cause they were some of the best
ill never forget how good it used to be

chorus
every scar has a story and it leaves its mark
guess you could say im the king of takin things way too far
i thought i knew pain
aint nothin i aint been through
but when i met you girl i fell hard
every scar has a story just ask my heart
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likebridge
they say old wounds heal with time and they get better
but the hurt you left on me will last forever

chorus
every scar has a story and it leaves its mark
guess you could say im the king of takin things way too far
i thought i knew pain
aint nothin i aint been through
but when i met you girl i fell hard
every scar has a story just ask my heart
every scar has a story just ask my heart
just ask my heartembed"
