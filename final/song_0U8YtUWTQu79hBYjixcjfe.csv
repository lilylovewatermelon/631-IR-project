pale faces that surround me eyes looking like round three
cup looking like nosebleed only sippin hydrocodeine
dah riding ruby sitting shotty
they said you see em—i said i got em
bottom lurkers snakes out the lake
ball and chain aint no escape
fuck the fame i just want the change
fuck a name i just want a grave
spit in your face grey be the apes
you sippin grape i dont want a taste
cooking dance when i cook the base
hit the lace now im feelin spaced
you see the tape where the bodies lay
say you real but i see the fake
fuck out of my face yeah so
am i in love with drugs yeah hoe
all my plugs got a mug on the record
warzone in the slums like a desert

verse 2 oddy nuff da now leopard
uh uicideboy still alive why havent they died
17 more minutes till im bled dry gotta get my head right
tighten up the noose now my neck tied
no more breath hidin in my lungs im feeling calmer
im the shepherd with a flock of sheep claimin they want the slaughter
fathers sacrificin they daughters so their sons dont have to be offered up
i often off em anyway cause im the soul marauder
i toss em off and sail away to the devil to barter
take em underwater take em to the altar of hell
and let them wander while the devil separates the martyrs
whoevers left will be turned into walkers and crawlers
wait until the sky is darker and now theyre ready for departure
ruby da firestarter ruby da one who lets em all burn
screaming ruby fuck my bitch—i tell em all to wait their turn
snap my fingers now theyre feelin how the flames burn
then i extinguish em and assume that its a lesson learned
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 3 dah
yeah so yeah so
its a dead man walking aint too big on talking
chalk laying in the places i be stalking
coughing off the nicotine living dreams and coughing
you ever vision me bitch get the hearse
doing dirt check my fingernails
living swell throwing hunnids in a wishing well
vicious sales from all the shit thats being shipped in mail
this some shit i didnt think that i would live and tell
hell couldnt hold me the one and only
dodoublela aint into fair play
do crimes stack cheddar
whole grain nothing better
shoot first ask never
no bet im suicidal homicidal
grab the rifle
prolly die of overdose im fucking bitches on the eiffel
the only time that im ever arrogant is outta spite
and we getting high in the area thats black and white
cause if you aint know8embed"
