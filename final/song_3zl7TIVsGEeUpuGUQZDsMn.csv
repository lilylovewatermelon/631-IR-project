a message to our enemies
never fuck with one whos had to fight for being free
whether its one or two or three
well take our pleasure out on making you believe
and im taking you out and im taking you down youll see
and im taking you out and im taking you down with me

the pride of america is the fear thats in your eyes
and your insecurity will undo you in time
i hear the people say
hey hey hey hey hey
cause were the pride of america

a message to your enemies
never fuck with one whos had to fight for being free
whether its one or two or three
well take our pleasure out on making you believe
and im taking you out and im taking you down youll see
and im taking you out and im taking you down with me

the pride of america is the fear thats in your eyes
and your insecurity will undo you in time
its just like the old folks say its an eye for an eye
