with no funny play cuz i got the gun at my waist
and like stunna say feeling like a hunter today

we on dubs its all love this shit crazy
and cash money is the label that made me

verse 4 mikkey

we like a cedar we just straight from the dirt

more than music this is rap hustlin
this is money mackin and publishin
death before struggling thats shine daddy
