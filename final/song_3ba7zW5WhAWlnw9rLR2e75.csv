did you see the way she looked at me
honey bee’s got two lies and she’s got me

chorus
i tried to love her back
and then i shrunk back into my wrap
and in the barrel of my gun
i hope i’m not the only one

verse 2
yes i see the way she looked at me
oh she’s got an eye for an awkward guy like me

chorus
i tried to love her back she’s just a girl
and then i shrunk back into my wrap she’s just a girl
and in the barrel of my gun
i hope i’m not the only one
and in the barrel of my gun
i hope i’m not the only one
