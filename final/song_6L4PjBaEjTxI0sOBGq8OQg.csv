if we never flew we would never fall
if the world was ours we would have it all
but the life we live isnt so simplistic
you just dont get what you want

prechorus logan henderson
so we take what comes and we keep on going
leaning on each others shoulders
then we turn around
and see weve come so far somehow

chorus james maslow
were halfway there were looking good now
nothings gonna get in the way
were halfway there and looking back now
i never thought that id ever say

bridge james maslow
were halfway there
were halfway there

verse 2 kendall schmidt
when the chips are down back against the wall
got no more to give cause we gave it all
seems like going the distance is unrealistic
but were too far from the start

so we take what comes and we keep on going
leaning on each others shoulders
then we turn around
and see weve come so far somehow

chorus james maslow
were halfway there were looking good now
nothings gonna get in the way
were halfway there and looking back now
i never thought that id ever say

bridge james maslow
were halfway there
were halfway there

verse 3 logan henderson
how you ever gonna reach the stars
if you never get off the ground
and youll always be where you are
if you let life knock you down
