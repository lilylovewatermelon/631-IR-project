a drunk man walking down a rainy street
a wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
you look down and suddenly youre looking up
whoops i slipped and fell in love

verse 2
a bald tire running on an icy road
a steep hill underneath a foot of snow
a greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
whoops i slipped and fell in love

chorus
i hope that youre feeling the way that i feel
its just like flying but youre standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
whoops i slipped and fell in love

verse 3
an ice cube hiding on your kitchen floor
a bad step leading up to your back door
howd i wind up on my butt
whoops i slipped and feel in love

chorus
i hope that youre feeling the way that i feel
its just like flying but youre standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
whoops i slipped and fell in love
i hope that youre feeling the way that i feel
its just like flying but youre standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
whoops i slipped and fell in love
