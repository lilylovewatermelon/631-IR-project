verse 1 meek mill
uh pull up on ya put it on ya
fuck you in the car if he looking for you
seen you with your man and said “what up to ya”
like you aint give me that work
it was california 5 in the morning
i was plottin on ya we was hot as sauna
tryna pop up on ya
and fuck you good on that purp
we linkin up gettin faded we fell in love and we made it
