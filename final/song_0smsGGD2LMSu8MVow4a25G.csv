how how am i supposed to feel
when everything surrounding me
is nothing but a fake disguise
i dont know
i dont know where i belong
its time for me to carry on
ill say goodbye

chorus
i cant stop the rain from fallin
im drownin in these tears i cry
since you left without a warning
i face the dawn with sleepless eyes
no i cant go on
when clouds are pushin down on me boy
i cant stop i cant stop the rain
from fallin

verse 2
so tell me where i went wrong
im stuck inside a dream long gone
its hard to reveal the truth
your love
is nothing but a bitter taste
its better if i walk away
away from you
see cascada liveget tickets as low as 83you might also likechorus
i cant stop the rain from fallin
im drownin in these tears i cry
since you left without a warning
i face the dawn with sleepless eyes
no i cant go on
when clouds are pushin down on me boy
i cant stop i cant stop the rain
from fallinembed"
