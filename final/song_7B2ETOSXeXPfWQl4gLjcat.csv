how come all the pretty girls like you are taken baby
ive been looking for someone like you to save me
lifes too easy to be so damn complicated
take your time and ill be waiting

chorus
keep me in mind
somewhere down the road you might get lonely
keep me in mind
and i pray someday that you will love me only

verse 2
i think about you somedays
and the way i would lay and waste a day after day with you
we always go our separate ways
but no one can love you baby the way i do

chorus
keep me in mind
somewhere down the road you might get lonely
keep me in mind
and i pray someday that you will love me only

verse 3
well the world can be real tough
find shelter in me
if theres no one else to love
keep me in mind
if ever you wanted me ill be your man
id be a fool to let you go with someone else
whatever you want from me ill be your man
id give it all up just to have you for myself
