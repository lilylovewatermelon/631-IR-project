verse 1
i miss the way you kiss
miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
miss the way your hair blows in the wind
and i miss you staying here til the morning
miss the way you put on your makeup
miss the way you love me too much
its everything about you baby
wanna know where you been lately
do you go out
do you still live at your old house
do you got somebody new in your life
cause i cant get you out of my mind

prechorus
and i wanna erase
but i cant stop seeing your face
and every girl i try to replace you with
why cant i get over it simply cause i cant

i cant stop missing everything you say
missing all the crazy love we made
whyd you throw it all away
i want you to know

and i had my doubts
every time you was going out
cause i knew you were telling me lies
and i cant get that outta my mind

and every girl i try to replace you with
why cant i get over it simply cause i cant
