the cycle repeated
as explosions broke in the sky
all that i needed
was the one thing i couldnt find

prechorus chester bennington
and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know

chorus chester bennington
were building it up
to break it back down
were building it up
to burn it down
we cant wait to burn it to the ground

verse 2 chester bennington
the colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
i wanted to fix this
but couldnt stop from tearing it down

prechorus chester bennington
and you were there at the turn
caught in the burning glow
and i was there at the turn
waiting to let you know

to burn it down
we cant wait to burn it to the ground

bridge mike shinoda
you told me yes you held me high
and i believed when you told that lie
i played soldier you played king
and struck me down when i kissed that ring
you lost that right to hold that crown
i built you up but you let me down
so when you fall ill take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn

prechorus chester bennington
and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know

chorus chester bennington
were building it up
to break it back down
were building it up
to burn it down
we cant wait to burn it to the ground
outro mike shinoda  chester bennington
when you fall ill take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we cant wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall ill take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we cant wait to burn it to the ground57embed"
