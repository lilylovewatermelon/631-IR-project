verse 3 flo rida
hey little mama like really really is that him
i done seen you before what you got on them big rims
enter that cash flow im like baby you dont trip
so shawty say hand over your signature right here
like adjust the dotted line and im supposed to sign
how she at it a fanatic and i think its goin down
she so starstruck the gal all stuck
i shoulda had an overdose too many starbucks
aint never seen a balla paper that stack taller
stunners who let the top back on the chevy impala
hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers
what did you call that when you showed up with two dollars
but thats another chapter son of a bachelor
all on me just spotted a baby actor
complete swagger there go the dagger
got what she wants shawty happily ever after
