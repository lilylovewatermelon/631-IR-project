verse 1 jayz
whether we dribble out this motherfucker
rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
work second floors hospital out this motherfucker
some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
some day the copsll kill a muhfucker
i dont always wanna be this drug dealing muhfucker damn
wish i could take us all
on this magic carpet ride through the sky
i used to play the hall and fifth floor
me and my boys we all poor getting high
i seen the worst of the worst
i deserve every blessing i received im from the dirt
i planted my seed on unfertile land
myrtle park marcy flushing and nostrand
and still i grew
some how i knew that the sunll shine through and
touch my soul take hold of my hand
look man a tree grows in brooklyn

verse 2 beanie sigel
to lil nell sigel street i aint forget you
twenty niggas on the block tryna chase that buck
nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck
cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
moms smoke kids cant chase the ice cream truck
girls fighting over rope the young boys hype things up
niggas fighting over coke the young boys light things up
all the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
member lil eddie draw man how he light mean up
then they wonder why we light green up
back to back steam up try to relax but i cant i lean up
aint the l or the reefer that steam up that steam up
its my head and im stressed to the point i get a fever
thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
that cant leave and how the chinks gotta feed em
for the rest of they life
fucking wings fried vegetable rice
gotta be kidding no breakfast capn crunch at night
how the kids eating lunch at night
in they beds all bunched in tight no less than three or four
you know how it go two by the foot two by the headboard
man im getting scared for them yeah i know
thats how i feel for them
we gotta grip of shorties on the block
all they do is smoke weed and drink 40s cop they lil quarties
enough to get the latest roc newest glock old jordies
chorus beanie sigel
some how some way
we gon make it up out this hood one day
some how some way
we gon make it up out this life yeah

we gon make it up out the hood one day
some way
we gon make it up out this life

verse 3 scarface
right heres another lil story bout this clique i claimed
another chapter based on how i get that game
just hanging round my neighborhood bang my street
sit and watch the passerbys play my sweep
southside sunnyside is the blocks i run
south acres south park niggas all got guns
over here we got this code charlie get that there
we know tomorrow aint a promise so we get that now
fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
working inside a smoke house starving to death
serving these niggas flippers quarterounces and jippers
agents snapping your picture neighbors plotting to get ya
situations a critic i was out here be getting it
living it like a savage cause nigga i gotta have it
they holding back on a motherfucker im in it for the haul dawg
erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all yall
the lord be awilling and the creek dont rise
ima be a nigga and these streets gon rise
some how some way some how some way
ima be a nigga and these streets gon rise some how some way
chorus jayz
