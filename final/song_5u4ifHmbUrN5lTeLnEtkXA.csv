you know im stubborn set in my ways
said id never fall in love used all the old cliches
but just now when you called and my heart rate hit the roof
i realized its time to eat my words and face the truth

chorus
so come on over tonight well sit on the swing
watch the pigs fly by flapping their brand new wings
just sit back and relax watch me eat my hat
while the oak trees sprout dollar bills
and i look you in the eye
to finally say the words i swore
id never say in my whole life
so come on over tonight

verse 2
i called my buddies theyre coming too
after the way i ran my mouth
they cant believe its true
theyre bringing pizza and sweet tea
and i hope that you dont mind
but they said theyve got to see this
and they promise to be quiet

chorus
so come on over tonight well sit on the swing
watch the pigs fly by flapping their brand new wings
just sit back and relax watch me eat my hat
while a big ol bolt of lightnin
strikes me not just once but twice
as i say the words i swore
id never say in my whole life
yeah come on over tonight
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 1
me falling in love thats one of those things
that i swore would never come true
but im starting to think that nothing is impossible now
that i found you nothing

chorus
yeah come on over tonight well sit on the swing
watch the pigs fly by flapping their brand new wings
just sit back and relax watch me eat my hat
see the premiere performance of demons on ice
as i say the words i swore
id never say in my whole life

outro
so come on over
hey come on over
said come on over tonight1embed"
