verse 1
were in a picture black and white
you took the light out of my life
when you gave in
were playing out our different roles
we should be wanting the same goals
listening forgiving

prechorus
oh why cant we communicate
when the main feature is just beginning

chorus
in this silent movie
theres no talking
youre just an actor
so break into my story
take it over
paint me with color

verse 2
everybodys speaking but you dont know what theyre saying
youre just guessing meanings
interpreting emotion through a window that is broken
were just testing feelings
