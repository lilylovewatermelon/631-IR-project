whyd you cut holes in the face of the moon base
dont you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow
are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
unknown force can repair things for you
pardon all the time that youve thrown into your pale gray garden
if your ship will never come you gotta move along

chorus
even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
the prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
the falling apart
made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
if shes going under i can hold my breath til the sky comes back
or drown like a rat rat rat
hes a rat

guitar solo

bridge
to catch a monster we make a movie
set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
it will inspire on the burning pyre
half the distance half the motion
communication is easy as the ocean
