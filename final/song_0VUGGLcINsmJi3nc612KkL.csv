im thinking of
thanking all the fucked people
thanking all the shit i love
they are all the things ive made
straight from my heart
begging all the same people
burning is the same evil
somehow making me feel sane

prechorus
waiting all this time
ive got nothing to hold on
but the faces of my life
i can see before im gone

chorus
sometimes i feel it chasing me
all the hate thats breaking free
i realize im taking everything
and the shit seems to follow

this time i feel it taking me
to a place i need to be
all along i sing to make believe
and the shit seems to follow
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
im thinking of
making all the fucked people
making the bitches i love
make them die and go away
pain from the start
all my dreams are ripped apart
thanking all the fucked people
they are all the things ive said

prechorus
waiting all this time
ive got nothing to hold on
but the faces of my life
i can see before im gone

chorus
sometimes i feel it chasing me
all the hate thats breaking free
i realize im taking everything
and the shit seems to follow

this time i feel it taking me
to a place i need to be
all along i sing to make believe
and the shit seems to follow
bridge
your life
i hate it oh god
can i replay
stop and help me stop and help me

chorus
sometimes i feel it chasing me
all the hate thats breaking free
i realize im taking everything
and the shit seems to follow

this time i feel it taking me
to a place i need to be
all along i sing to make believe
and the shit seems to follow

outro
the shit seems to follow
the shit seems to follow
the shit seems to follow
the shit seems to follow3embed"
