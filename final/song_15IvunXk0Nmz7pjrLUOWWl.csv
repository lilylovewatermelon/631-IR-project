watching the world
watching them all go insane
look at em all
look at em do evil things

chorus william
so i go out and dance
party my problems away
look at me now
look at me dancing again
in a club nothing really matters
in a club nothing really matters
in a club nothing really matters
in a club nothing really matters
but the beat
in a club

verse 2 william
i rock club light come out at night
shot til daylight
hot models my type
lets go take flight
explode dynamite
disco blacklight
in a club
party people rocking hardcore in a club
dj rock the fucking dancefloor in a club
hot mamas dancing all alone in a club
i just came to rock on out to escape from the world

verse 4 william
feeling like a star when i walk in the house
dj spin that record and he burned down the house
just like mc hammer imma turn the motha out
imma rock the dance floor check me out
i am with all my people we gon fuck up the place
i was stressed out so i had to get away
the world is going mad i think they gone crazy
so i just gotta break on out
