but theres a bright and a sunny side too
though you meet with the darkness and strife
the sunny side you also may view

keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
keep on the sunny side of life
it will help us evry day it will brighten all the way
if well keep on the sunny side of life

though the storm and its fury rage today
crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
the clouds and storm will in time pass away
the sun again will shine bright and clear

keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
keep on the sunny side of life
it will help us evry day it will brighten all the way
if well keep on the sunny side of life

let us greet with the song of hope each day
though the moment be cloudy or fair
and let us trust in our savior always
who keepeth everyone in his care

keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
keep on the sunny side of life
it will help us evry day it will brighten all the way
if well keep on the sunny side of life
