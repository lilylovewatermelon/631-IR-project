the first time i met her
she walked right up to me
and said youre who i wanted to find
there was a man she had seen in her dreams
and it was me

verse 2
she said i cant believe it
cause ive never been in here
and ive passed this place so many times
it was her night to find destiny
and it was me

chorus
and we danced every song that they played
and talked until closing time
the closer i held her
the more i knew her destiny
wasnt that far from mine

bridge
than i saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar
looking back when i looked in her eyes
the happiest man id ever seen
and it was me

verse 3
she wasnt looking
and i wasnt looking
aint it funny
thats when love was found
she still calls it her lucky night
yeah someone was lucky
shes right
but it was meembed"
