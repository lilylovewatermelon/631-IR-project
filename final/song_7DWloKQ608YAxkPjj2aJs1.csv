muddy water coming out of the sink in there
dirty sheets up on the bed
i cant get no picture on the tv screen
i cant stand the ones up in my head
i got the air turned down to very cold
but it aint doing a bit of good
it aint like there was a first resort
in this last chance for gas neighborhood

chorus
i was looking for freedom
i was looking for a good time
i was looking for a little space
a little place that was mine all mine
i was going with my change of heart
and wanted no part of forever
i was looking for a blessing
when i said baby its all for the better
yeah what do you know i think i wound up
where she told me to go

verse 2
of all the places man i broke down here
shade tree mechanic told me son
i cant get no parts for this here make in here
but dont worry boy ill get it done
meanwhile i need to be back with her yesterday
clock in this town dont seem to care
im finding fast this god forsaken place
is at least two weeks from everywhere

i was looking for freedom
i was looking for a good time
i was looking for a little space
a little place that was mine all mine
i was going with my change of heart
and wanted no part of forever
i was looking for a blessing
when i said baby its all for the better
yeah what do you know i think i wound up
where she told me to go

outro
this place aint on no map
but how was i to know
its everywhere that she aint at
how did she know that id wind up
where she told me to go
muddy water coming out of the sink in there1embed"
