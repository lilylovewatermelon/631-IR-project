i can see it coming round full circle my friend
on the tv they said they had reported you dead
it was my fault cause i couldve sworn that you said
it was easy to find another for your bed

prechorus
how does it feel to leave me this way
when all that you haves been lost in a day
everyone knows but not what to say
ive been wonderin now

chorus
ive been staring at the hotel ceiling
drinking everything ive found this evening
trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
so ill never let you go dont you leave me lonely
start to see this everyone i know cannot believe this
im trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
so ill never let you go dont you leave me lonely now

verse 2
when my eyes open morning pulls me into the view no
i guess im only acting in the way that you do
just being alone no
only time tells me more than i hope all that i know is
ill be finding a fortnight alone and behold
i know i shouldnt have let you go

im trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
so ill never let you go dont you leave me lonely now
