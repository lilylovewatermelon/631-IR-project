its safe to say their love is over
its true i know that life goes on and on
but the more ive seen my foundations bleeding
the weaker i am from my roots to my heart

chorus
its over its over its over its over
its over its over its over its over

verse 2
i am running out of time
eventually they will both be just fine
my fathers wept and my mothers crying
i am the middle man and my strength is trying
for the best for them ill be straight up praying
nothing left now except connections failing

chorus
its over its over its over its over
its over its over its over its over
its over its over its over its over
its over its over its over

verse 3
take me back its all i need
you are the air that i breathe
i am the bullet you are the gun
we are the moon above the sun
if we be together then youll take my name
if we be forever then ill take the blame
i am my fathers son right to my bones
got my mothers eyes in the bluest tones
