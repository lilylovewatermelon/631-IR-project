days youve forgotten
now youre just standing
like nothing ever happened
i poured my feelings
and i thought you felt it
now nothings changed
i really regret this
youre a mindwinder
youre a mindwinder oh
i still remember the time
when your eyes they would shine
your hand would reach out to mine
and now i am losing my mindyou might also like3embed"
