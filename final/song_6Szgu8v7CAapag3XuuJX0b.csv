today i woke up in a good mood for once
first time in six months i dont hate you as much
you werent there in my dreams i could finally sleep
i felt good but it sucks i dont hate you as much

prechorus
its easier holdin a grudge grudge
id rather be angry than crushed crushed
im doin too much i do too much
im back where i started again again
cryin and callin my friends mm
this shit never ends ugh

chorus
i get so sick of myself
cant stop overthinkin
i heard youre happy somewhere else
but i dont forget too well
i get so sick of myself
cant stop reminiscin
i heard youre happy somewhere else
but i dont forget too well

verse 2
i still see your face i hate hearin your name
what a wreck what a shame im replayin that day
and you called me at eight two weeks on a break
just to ask for more space youre my biggest mistake
