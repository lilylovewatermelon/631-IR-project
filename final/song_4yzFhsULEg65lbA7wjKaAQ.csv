theres a big old hole
goes right through the sole
of this old shoe
and the water on the ground
aint got no place else its found
so its only got one thing left to do

chorus norah jones  dolly parton
just creep on in
creep on in
and once it has begun
it wont stop until its done
sneakin in

dolly parton
theres a silver moon
came a little too soon
oh for me to bear
it shines brightly on my bed
and the shadows overhead
wont let me sleep as long as its there

chorus norah jones  dolly parton
just creep on in
creep on in
and once it has begun
it wont stop until its done
sneakin in

theres a big old hole
goes right through my soul
oh that aint nothin new
