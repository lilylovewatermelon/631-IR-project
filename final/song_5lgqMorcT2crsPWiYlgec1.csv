am i asleep am i awake or somewhere in between
i cant believe that you are here and lying next to me
or did i dream that we were perfectly entwined
like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine
like all those days and weeks and months i tried to steal a kiss
and all those sleepless nights and daydreams where i pictured this
im just the underdog who finally got the girl
and i am not ashamed to tell it to the world

chorus all
truly madly deeply i am foolishly completely falling
and somehow you kicked all my walls in
so baby say youll always keep me
truly madly crazy deeply in love with you
in love with you

verse 2 liam zayn
should i put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
and wake you up with all the words that i still havent said
and tender touches just to show you how i feel
or should i act so cool like it was no big deal
wish i could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
ill put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
cause hereâ€™s the tragic truth if you dont feel the same
my heart would fall apart if someone said your name
you might also likechorus all
and truly madly deeply i am foolishly completely falling
and somehow you kicked all my walls in
so baby say youll always keep me
truly madly crazy deeply in love with you

bridge louis louis  niall
i hope im not a casualty
hope you wont get up and leave
might not mean that much to you
but to me its everything everything

chorus all zayn louis
truly madly deeply i am foolishly completely falling
and somehow you kicked all my walls in
so baby say youll always keep me
truly madly crazy deeply in love in love with you with you
in love with you in love in love with you with you
in love with you in love in love with you with you
with you oh17embed"
