i know a gal thats got a lot to lose
shes a pretty nice lady but shes kind of confused
got muscles in her head aint never been used
thinks she owns half of this town
starts drinking heavy gets a big red nose
she beats her old man with her pantyhose
then she takes him out buys him new clothes
its the way that the world goes round

chorus
thats the way that the world goes round
one minute youre up and the next youre down
its half an inch of water and you think youre gonna drown
thats the way that the world goes round

verse 2
well i was sittin in the tub just counting my toes
when the radiator broke and the water froze
i got stuck in the ice without any clothes
naked as the eyes of a clown
i was cryin ice cubes hoping that id croak
when the sun come through the window and the ice all broke
i said son of a gun man thats just a joke
and thats the way that the world goes around

thats the way that the world goes round
one minute youre up and the next youre down
its half an inch of water and you think youre gonna drown
thats the way that the world goes round

chorus
well i said thats the way that the world goes round
one minute youre up and the next youre down
got a half an inch of water and you think youre gonna drown
thats the way that the world goes round

thats the way that the world goes round
thats the way that the world goes roundembed"
