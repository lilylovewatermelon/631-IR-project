ima be that nnnnananail in your coffin
sayin that i softened
i was duckin down to reload
so you can save your petty explanations
i dont have the patience
before you even say it i know
you lelllet your pride or you ego talk slick to me no
that is not the way i get down
and look at how you lose your composure
now let me show you
exactly how the breakin point sounds

chorus chester bennington
i wanna  see you choke on your lies
swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery

verse 2 mike shinoda
what is it you want me to tell you im not the failure
i would rather live and let be
but you came with the right kind of threat to push me
to let you know you cant intimidate me
you dididisrespect me so clearly
now you better hear me
that is not the way it goes down
you did it to yourself and its over
now let me show you
exactly how the breakin point sounds

choke on your lies swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
