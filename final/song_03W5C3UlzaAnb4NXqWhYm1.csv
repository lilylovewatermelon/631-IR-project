all i need is woods so i can turn it to some smoke bitch
all i needs a half so i can turn it to a o bitch
never had a friend so im used to being alone
find me somewhere in between howard hughes and nina simone
what lilac wine with the fresh french roll
subtitles off cause one day we might move
1887 when the model t move
through the cobblestone streets where i let my mind brew
remember when we used to bring coins to the teller
remember when we used to steal bottles from the cellar
i’m blitzing with some brother had the ice white camo with the twin 38s because we didn’t know better

chorus
i know what youre thinking im thinking it too shit
smoke with my brothers we ride on that crew shit
we pull up the people like who this
who this who that who that now when i pull up in it they dont know how to act now
who this who that who that now when i pull up in it they dont know how to act now
im going hard im going hard

outro
this a brand new dj hiphop supreme smash
