im coverin joni and im dancin with joan
stevie is callin on the telephone
court almost burned down my home
but god it feels good not to be alone

prechorus
but sometimes this ranch feels like my only friend
and life doesnt always work out like we planned
we keep it movin babe

chorus
so we made it back in the middle of the night
to the louisiana twostep high and bright
and we wont say when we wont ask why
we wont stop dancin til we die
well keep walkin on the sunny side
and we wont stop dancin til we die

verse 2
troubled by my circumstancе
burdened by the wеight of fame
clementines not just a fruit
its my daughters chosen name

prechorus
and when all the bars close down tonight
theres one that stays open just for us alright
we keep dancin babe

so we made it back in the middle of the night we keep dancin babe
to the louisiana twostep high and bright we keep it movin babe
and we wont say when we wont ask why
we wont stop dancin til we die
well keep walkin on the sunny side
and we wont stop dancin til we die

bridge
i went down to woodside
i left berkeley out of city out of mind
killin it talkin shit joan said she was gonna quit
tearin it up at the afrocaribbean twostep
i left san francisco
ive been coverin joni and im dancin with joan
its kinda hard to find love
when youre used to rollin like a rollin stone

chorus
so we made it back in the middle of the night we keep it movin babe
to the louisiana twostep high and bright we keep dancin babe
and we wont say when we wont ask why
we wont stop dancin til we die
well keep walkin on the sunny side
and we wont stop dancin til we die
and we wont stop dancin til we die27embed"
