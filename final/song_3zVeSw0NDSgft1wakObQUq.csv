when we were introduced by your girl ruth
i knew that you got down
skin caramel complexion
lips chocolate brown
im wondering now
would you get huff for me
and let me stuff your philly blunt with
this black sensi
most definitely we can continuously
get high like the clouds that watch the city
guff till wed go blind like my man stevie
til the whites of her eyes are bloodshot glossy floss me
then well fall fast asleep
and when we wake up we can pick up where we left
see i dont mind if you dont
cause see im like if youre with it then its on
so see me tonight
all the while im hoping that she would inhale
so i could be like michael jackson and enjoy myself
cause what i want to do is make a tuna melt
should roll up in the sheets and let me spark that l

hook
what we going to do when the l is gone
should we just roll some more
so we can flow some more
or maybe i should just take you home
and make you fiend for me
like a love jones

verse 2
it we evident that you were hesitant when we did it
you rolled it i lit it we hit it
instantly you effected my state of being to cloud nine
i can tell that the hydro got you
by the way your eyes were half closed and mine too
lord knows if we would have rolled another stogie
you wouldve been holding on like en vogue
i knew that you laced it
yes indeed
cause i can tell when i tasted it
yes indeed
got me breaking in sweats
feeling like something crawling all over my neck
you got me drawn yes indeed
i cant believe that you got this type of effect on me
it seems that ive been fiending for you and youre fiending
for me for that high that we both need
tell me what
hook
what we going to do when the l is gone
should we just roll some more
so we can flow some more
or maybe i should just take you home
and make you fiend for me
like a love jones

what we going to do when the l is gone
should we just roll some more
so we can flow some more
or maybe i should just take you home
and make you fiend for me
like a love jonesembed"
