im fly

verse 1
man made the web you dont need a name yeah
man made of faults i aint too ashamed
every thought i had put it in a box box
everybody see it just before the cops
trolling trolling trolling these niggas
rickrolling these niggas
they mad cause they dont know any better
hold up its the kid—quick tell him he cant sit with us
fuck it got money bought friends like im tbs
vvs i can see it all with the clarity
real deep hope they dig a nigga fore they bury me
even though we were told to go where they wouldnt go
hella slow thats that dialup watch it pile up fly

we are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
door open we were smoking in the hotel
the vapors went through the hallway the manager pissed as hell
i mean wheres the line between donnyg and gambino
he hang with girls like he lena but needed some time to reup
tequila in the cantina thirty dollars i swallowed
the sauza so malo i nuzzled my nyla
and then she said you need to grow up
you been doing this for too long
that camp was a million years ago sing me a different song
whether youre trolling or controlling just a reminder
you think you get it you dont its that andrew auernheimer
im gone—now im back
give a fuck or give em hell just not a chance to react
tyler durden this burden hurting they said there was curtains
certain demise look in his eyes the pain inadvertent
i couldve stayed where i was and had a life youd be proud of
but id rather chase things never thought of
it was all love saying go hard
making dope its a trap ackbar backfired
panic dreams so it seems were meant to die
i had to figure it out its the best no thats a lie
had to get some stuff off my chest i vaporized
high on my own it took time to realize
because the internet mistakes are forever
but if we fuck up on this journey at least were together
man i wish i could go back and tell that kid its makebelieve
make him believe in himself people who needed my help
feelings i felt killing myself no ones ever been this lost
i just get the information retweet it or say it sucks
i just got the motivation your talents just bunch of luck
hard work and dedication but lately its run amok
waking up in these places i dont remember
texts from people i never met doors left open
who is this dont do it where are you
who is this who is this i dont know who i am anymore
still on the beat though
still in the game but he move with a cheat code
slowest connection ever my life inside a computer
them bands thatll make her dance my wallets lollapalooza
the violence firstperson shooter
first person to move first person to speak
my mils arent meek they scream in the streets
losing my frame of reference these pieces of shit for breakfast
funny the day you born thats really your death sentence
i met this girl at a dinner we conversatin
she beautiful in the face but her voice is truly amazing
plus she write her own shit becoming so close knit
smoke up and talk in the evening she helping me focus
no anna nicole smith she getting hers
niggas take her props like a musical live and learn
she say she feel alone all the time im similar
i meet her in my dreams on the moon i visit her
every night i text her i wanna solve the world i think i need your help
she text me how you gon trust somebody when you dont trust yourself
i mean she right though 45 like a lightbulb
and i couldve died like my iphone but i kept going like a psycho
and i took chance like a dice roll dropping jewels like its puberty
wrote a note on the glass you see what these labels do to me
text said im wet i said hold up wait a minute
h2o plus my d thats my hood im living in it
never forget this feeling never gon reach a million
eventually all my followers realize they dont need a leader
stay on your own shit fuck what these clones think
just remember that you the shit but act like it dont stink
we were childish but had to grow up
when you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
realities like allergies im afraid to go nuts
life the biggest troll but the joke is on us
yeah the jokes you showed up
outro
youre here now
you have to help me
you have to help me
i need you—you have to help me
you have to help me
you have to help me
please help me
please help me
please please help me
please—156embed"
