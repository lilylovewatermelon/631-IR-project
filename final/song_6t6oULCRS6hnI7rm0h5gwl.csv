some nights i stay up cashing in my bad luck
some nights i call it a draw
some nights i wish that my lips could build a castle
some nights i wish theyd just fall off
but i still wake up i still see your ghost
oh lord im still not sure what i stand for oh
ohoohwoah what do i stand for
ohoohwoah what do i stand for
most nights i dont know anymore

refrain
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
ohoohwoahoh ohoh

verse 1
this is it boys this is war
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
what are we waiting for
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
why dont we break the rules already
i was never one to believe the hype
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
save that for the black and white
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
try twice as hard and im half as liked
but here they come again to jack my style

and thats alright thats alright
i found a martyr in my bed tonight
she stops my bones from wondering
just who i who i who i am
oh who am i mmm mmm

chorus 2
well some nights i wish that this all would end
cause i could use some friends for a change
and some nights im scared youll forget me again
some nights i always win i always win
but i still wake up i still see your ghost
oh lord im still not sure what i stand for oh
ohoohwoahoh what do i stand for
ohoohwoahoh what do i stand for
most nights i dont know

bridge
oh come on so this is it
i sold my soul for this
washed my hands of that for this
i miss my mom and dad for this
oh come on no when i see stars when i s
when i see stars thats all they are
when i hear songs they sound like a swan
so come on oh come on oh come on
oh come on
verse 2
well that is it guys that is all
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
five minutes in and im bored again
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
ten years of this im not sure if anybody understands
this one is not for the folks at home
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
sorry to leave mom i had to go
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
who the fuck wants to die alone
all dried up in the desert sun

bridge
my heart is breaking for my sister
and the con that she called love
and then i look into my nephews eyes
man you wouldnt believe
the most amazing things
that can come from
some terrible nights

refrain
alright come on
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
ohwoah ohoohwoahoh
ohoohwoahoh ohoh
outro
the other night you wouldnt believe
the dream i just had about you and me
id called you up but we both agreed
