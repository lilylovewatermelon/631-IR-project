im just walking along
stuck in a song whistling thusly
stereotypical life
kids and a wife three of them plus me

verse 2
neils inspiration is thin
thin as a pin there isnt much to me
so im just walking along
stuck in a song happily gloomy

chorus
break it off break it off take me out
dont let the melody fake me out
break it off break it off take me out
dont let the melody fake me out

verse 3
i dont even have a name
this brings me shame im so diminished
i know all songs have an end
i could pretend this one is finished

verse 4
i guess both ways i am screwed
maybe if youd do me a favor
if this tracks on a cd
skip it for me youd be my savior
