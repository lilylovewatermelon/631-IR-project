verse 1
once youre lost
in twilights blue
you dont find your way
the way finds you

verse 2
tempt the fates
beware the smile
it hides all the teeth my dear
and whats behind them

chorus
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever

verse 3

a crooked man
theres blood on the blade
dont take his hand

you warm by the firelight
in twilights blue
shadows creep and dance the walls
hes creeping too

chorus
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever
so glad you could stay forever
