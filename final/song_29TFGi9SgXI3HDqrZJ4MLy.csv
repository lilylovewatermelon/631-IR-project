theres peanut dust and corn husks drifting through the air tonight
the marching bands warming up under the football lights
theres tractortrailers backed up down by the elevator
train track grain car will roll in later
get filled up and head on out in the world

chorus
its harvest time in this little town
time to bring it on in pay the loans down
fill our diesel tank up make another round
theres a big red moon coming up in the sky
combines cutting in a staggered line
the only time of year we miss the church bells chime
its harvest time

verse 2
theres a thermos and a water jug rolling around in the cab
a set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
bobbys mother pulls in the field bringing us supper
we grab a bite and make sure to hug her
saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

chorus
its harvest time in this little town
time to bring it on in pay the loans down
fill our diesel tank up make another round
theres a big red moon coming up in the sky
combines cutting in a staggered line
the only time of year we miss the church bells chime
its harvest time

at a quarter til 2 i kick off my boots in the laundry room
well start it all over tomorrow at noon
till its all done until were all done

chorus
its harvest time in this little town
time to bring it on in pay the loans down
fill our diesel tank up make another round
theres a big red moon coming up in the sky
combines cutting in a staggered line
the only time of year we miss the church bells chime
its harvest time
its harvest timeembed"
