ohhhhh

intro
ive tried everything to catch up to ya speed
and be the man you need even change my ways
but you always leaving me shaking my head
pushing me to the edge all you do is complain
i thought it was fate
guess i made a mistake
accusing me of things i didnt do

verse 1
but ima set you straight cause tonight im coming home late
and you can cry all you want but i aint taking the bait
and you can beg me to stay but no way it aint up for debate
asking who what where and why
dont matter if im cheating in your mind
what the hell
might as well be out there doing what i want to all the time yeah

chorus
watch me as my jeans sag low when i walk out the door
ima go be a man cause you forgot that i wear the pants
watch me get these girls on the floor get em asking for more
ima go do my dance cause she forgot that i rock the pants

youre independent work hard
all the above and that i appreciate
every now and then gotta understand
that a man got a breathe that i need my space
from the very last time i kissed ya
let there be a gap give me time to miss ya
and ima go out with the fellas dont blow up my cell
be cool and ima catch you later

chorus
watch me as my jeans sag low when i walk out the door
ima go be a man cause you forgot that i wear the pants
watch me get these girls on the floor get em asking for more
ima go do my dance cause she forgot that i rock the pants
watch me as my jeans sag low when i walk out the door
ima go be a man cause you forgot that i wear the pants
watch me get these girls on the floor get em asking for more
ima go do my dance cause she forgot that i rock the pants

bridge
he tratado de ser todo para ti
y hacerte feliz con todo cumplí
pero siempre dices que yo soy infiel
que yo no te doy querer me alejas de ti
pensé que gané pero creo que fallé
por eso es que esta noche no me quedo contigo
chorus
watch me as im gone watch me as
my jeans sag low when i walk out the door
ima go be a man cause you forgot that i wear the pants
watch me get these girls on the floor get em asking for more
ima go do my dance cause she forgot that i rock the pants
watch me as my jeans sag low when i walk out the door
ima go be a man cause you forgot that i wear the pants
watch me get these girls on the floor get em asking for more
ima go do my dance cause she forgot that i rock the pantsembed"
