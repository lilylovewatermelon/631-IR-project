verse 1 andrew
hey let me tell you about a place out east
just fifteen minutes from the la streets
hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
like its a mystical land filled with immigrants
the foods authentic the price is perfect
where restaurants focus on the taste not service
be ready to share cause its family style
time with the fam makes granny proud

were far enough from la where nobodys actin phony
except maybe on our taxes it’s cash only
tell the health department stop hating
’cause a b rating stands for better tasting
where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
and they roast more duck than swishers
its the 626 man check the address
home of sriracha and panda express

verse 3 andrew  david
sometimes i wonder am i still in america
how come there’s still a language barrier
if you need help read yelp check the reviews
my elite friends make it easy to choose
theres traditional rivalries between high schools
they started back when there was still some white dudes
no matter where you go they cant match the price
so youre always coming back to the cafe life
if jtowns got sake and ktown soju
what do we have oh yea we got bobas
hot spots to get some hot pot and dim sum
shout out to asian girls let the lights dim some
from shanghai to saigon tokyo to taiwan
beijing to hong kong something to bite on
valley atlantic garvey i drive on
3 in the morning cafes got their lights on
