came in early all gassed up for the drop
like how could i drop on a beat like that
thats dank if i ever saw dank in my life thats dank
like 35 of the am ah fam i aint hacking the way he just came in
just came in the game all brazen
these man are pussy like pay men
ill roll on a pussy like pussy wheres payment
no understatement rah are you paying for the pussy
paying for the puss with your wages wussy
if i make this hoody go wushy its suttin like ssss nah get shushy
see i gave him this old school nuggy and made him cry
ca im too pushy i gave him this bald patch ca im too big now
too big now so you cant push me
changed my name to resident why
more citizens cold start head locking censored
with the gang thats far ruckus
about calm down you aint got pouch muppet
just lie with your mandem probably cause a crowd cover
you wont house nothing
hype nothings about hype cousins
doubt brothers will come round bussing
peep these gs on the back road suttin like footpaths
suttin like low key the way a man pick this green like am buds
suttin like brockley suttin like bogie
the way i see these man throw their hands up
like raising arms for the police
suttin like kungfu chop to their arm pits
suttin quite forceful nottin like ob
suttin like how can a man try diss man
how can a man try snake man
how can a man try risk that
how can he wear that wrist watch and try talk like a big man
and tell a man piss off
but i wont make man miss that
but i wont set this ting off
but i dont know about riff raff
but i dont know about big bags
about wisdom aint a big boss
charge next man ten pound for tictac
but i dont know about big bucks
fat like rick ross
but i dont know bout chin man
bust that sling shot
risk your life when the ting pops
huh i aint seen man
mans vile when the spliff stops
run wild and i win lots
come trial with the big dog
they aint shelling nothing if ive been on
simply simply she want the d ca im dimply
thinking im old and im wrinkly
couldnt chat to the wis on diss
im on a don when i work on a symphony
come with your one line flow like
man couldnt write the flow when i was stuck in assembly
mans beating the base til its timbery
tambourine rappers aint touching my energy
cause im worldwide
i dont know nothing about no likes
in fact i dont know nothing about ghost writes
but i know a little suttin bout wrote mine
oh my theyre so myan
theyre predicting shit but theyre so lying
looking at man like im no simon
like their bossing me i get so simon
get so violent start close lining
o in ear like im blow drying
got hoes on the pole i aint no fireman
got bare on the pole like cold climates
my theyre so admiring like the o roles through like a known giant
looking at man like im no simon
like their bossing me i get so simon
its tragic i swear man is embarrassed
like how the fuck did they manage
like how the fuck did they cope
if that was me i swear i wouldnt have it
mans got all the flows that you got
but you cant hack the flows that mans chatting
hancock called and said you know what that’s too much might to match when os rapping
so what do you reckon that youll be willing now youll be probably following second
cause everybody in my city got a hobby for heckling
‘til i roll up and they realise a prodigy stepping in
and then they shush quite big now i might throw you in a bush
quite big now ya cant tell me about push
might push push push ‘til i cant push
cant tell me about
old school like actual soccer
catch a couple mandem claiming that theyre casually blotting
i have to roll up on them tell them would you pack it and stop it
i heard a couple man that want it but regretting the shotting
and everybody love it when i tell them biggidy bobbady
yeah they love it when the wizzy tell em biggidy bobbady
couple man that chatted to me shitter philosophy
i aint really tryna hear it i aint listening properly

deadly how the flow deadly
how you flow like that over them medley
all the don dadda all the don dadda
pointing in mirrors hope that you get me
man got that armour so they know i sentry
still they got sentry sent to come get me
sent to defend them but it dont tempt me
ca im so dangerous and the flow deadly
you get me im deadly
you people are gonna respect me
dont bill me im not wesley
i got bills now im on the bill now
got bookings looking all hefty
but i see brudda my dad in me talking bout how the music industry stress me
man wanna talk about ocean touching the mainstream like im an estuary
see i aint got tekkers like him or tekkers like her or tekkers like heskey
me i stay doing my ting to the tone of my skin looking blacker than pepsi
and all of the man at my show got a smile on their face cause the gal looking sexy
like she got a double barrelled name shell get the double barrel in her belly
thats rick ross living big belly hitting day regularly jelly
sometimes when your mind flies and youre left behind it gets scary
ca youre left flipping them burgers while they’re on earners spitting on tele
now man wanna chat about work rate but its too late for that ca they werent ready
now we say were not sorry and when fiends chase were not worried
ca when the beat shakes in my body they cant try replace me or copy
when the beat shakes in your body thats just you getting beat by geezer
nuff man wanna chat about knees up thats why they cant get their ps up
ease up with the waving
do you see your young self waving goodbye to the man you became ca you lost your way when you went out raving
no are you sure though
hang on bro look more dough
ca i see the boy in you thats why i’m boying you
you aint the boss on your but i might move three plates with my donnys
i dont do freebasing or molly
im finna roundhouse kick the taxman hes taking too much percent from me
feeling like jon jones in this bitch still i might box man i dont sniff
see the way im calling out for these gs gs gs all now im like chris
did you bank on this kid chasing dreams spitting like this
soon as i got that direct message from charlie i started getting angry at chip
then i thought wait let me digest
better not retch do it like wretch
then i thought wait do it like ghetts
ca i switch flows and i go next
suttin like suttin like in a sec how the spit intersect with the sound of the song you select on a deck
in effect a revet in a mess ca im blessed with the pen and im blessed on a set
got the s on my chest so the best of the best get left with the rest thats stressed
invest in a vest and a vocal the cheque that you got it aint got long legs
if you got a strong chest then you might not cough when i tump your head
you aint using that its collecting dust you should unplug it before bed
go to sleep and dont wake up so we can save us whats left
ca any moment them geeky neeks are gonna take us out but i ain’t stressed
take us out but i inspect from miles away its all part of the test
like i try do my show and them feds try put man under arrest
swear mans got a vibrant soul til they find my chrome wan give man stress
mans going down a quite hype road tryna hide my goal tryna hide my flesh
from cautions to sentences their raucous theyre not tentative
let me sip my tea and just smoke my plant from the ground as the lord intended it
and man wanna chat about big man boss man but they dont pay no rent ‘til it
see i dont really know about that i just show a man tracks and they dont wanna censor it
can i get a little are you mad are you dumb thats a bar
can i get a little pond in the back of the yard with a bar in the garden for laughs
can i get a little fifteen bags for a show im on two so im on the right path
can i take a likkle time out now and then if i put too much stress on the art
ca you know these days its not funny thats why these sprays are not lully
still when the beat shakes in my body they cant try replace me or copy
when the beat shakes in your body thats just you getting beat by broski
nuff man wanna sell a man o zs cause they know i get that show p owe me
no apology if you leave me alone dont bother me
i mean really i know my qualities in all honesty i am not one of these little barrers
that you wanna go against rudeboy i aint nottin to fly against rudeboy
you aint running in no events rudeboy youre one of them no events rudeboy
verse 3

few man said when i blew and i werent on a hype no more that i went soft i went greazier
running through tings since double 09 but i cant lie fam its got easier
now i get lem thats sweet get am thats dank get cheese thats cheesier
now i draw vogueing models and tings and 22 tings thats moving sleazier
man wanna send for the wis like i wouldnt just headlock man like an eediot
and dem man never made money off rap now theyre pissed off ca they cant be dat
see i saw them man tryna form their plan but it didnt work now they wanna pree man
like hold on how you mean fam you seen the work rate so dont beef man
you likkle hobbyist real talk thats what it is
rap dont pay rent for the novices
now they pissed off ca they cant stop the wis
and it dont matter no more how many mandem man tell bout how wack wissy is
ca i got fans and im already killing it but they aint got fans no body listening no body listening
i said no body listening me i got the ting on my wrist and its glistening
you aint got ps in the bank so youre fidgeting
me i got a thou in the crowd when i spit a ting
see the legends and the ogs they respect man ca they know me
you got no job and your whole team is just two faced about broski
got that debut body of work and it charted trust me it cost ten pounds
whilst them man are doing free mixtapes free albums for the past five years what now
what’s the top five to a few wannabe mcs who cant get their sound off the ground
dem man aint living the dream and they pissed cause we living the movie and they lost out
living the movie and they lost out might flick on the crux for a grey nostalg’
flick on the level one whatever one is the better one wizzy might knock a man out
i be the better one they be the rest and they stressing cause i be the talk of the town
if you a rapper critic fan hater you know bout the team by now
nobodys saying your name you aint getting no hate you aint getting no love in your town
you just embarrass yourself tryna stagger and doubt while the wizzy be running around
see how a friendly might turn to an enemy see how a snakey might turn to a pal
now more time when im counting that musical cheddar i laugh at them bredders aloud
nah thats vip youre not allowed stand in the crowd or you could bounce
i saw your cheque why did it bounce i saw your chick why did she bounce
i saw your mum why aint she proud cause youre fucking about getting fucked in your censored by a rapper that’s levels above
and its obvious that youll shut up when im shutting it down
who told them girls get a nooking or theyll get a booking
who told these kids theyre ghetto they aint never been jucking
dem man shoulda moved like dwayne them man should have smelt what’s cooking
dem man shouldnt call my name dem man shoulda know o shush them
might do a show for a grand for a favour but they do a show for a bill and get gassed
might have a business meet with a major i might fly greece get payed in cash
dis music it takes us everywhere but they aint flying nowhere off tracks
we might just benefit other economies what do they know about paying european tax
what do they know about merchandising what do they know about stats
what do they know about ten man circle of experts all of them got mans back
what do they know about blending genres breaking glass ceilings or tryna change hiphop
they dont know about fuck all so piss off they aint got fuck all magic to switch on
they was gassing their 10k views in a year blud we heard what they said
we might upload one tune at night might get 10k before we go bed
might not mention names might not give man life that’s dead
might just pave our way but dont think we aint heard what a mans said
hes something that you man never hear exclusive premier
my gang done a tune with premier you’re gang got a room in the premier
that’s why you should when a bredder ere when we gone better act like a bredder der
ca your talk gets back to a bredder ear yeah we know whos talking we been aware
my man couldnt get a booking from a blind man whats he talking bout status
if we holla now man wanna kick it like van damme cause of all these papers
if youre from my town and youre hating on us then youre pissed off cause you didnt make it
its funny how all the other dons that’s doing their ting can appreciate it i appreciate it
your net worth depreciating i write a bar and i feed the nation
you write a bar pure procrastination try rap a statement thats altercations
yeah im hyping a bit charlie ignorant man they be hyping a lot
like i give a shit too late now its unlikely to stop
thats swingers in the mist when i dig him in the rib a little hit him in the middle with the street in the middle
with the face any time i feel obliged and a brudda wanna front never seen a brudda in it for the love where im from
wife has said it right she love the way i rhyme love the i way i look know bout what im on
spread her to the side whenever she wanna ride she grabbing up on her thighs she wrapping up on her thong
all you ever do is lie whenever i hear a rhyme im flicking it til youre silent kicking it off the dog
none of you niggas vibe when everybody be hyping everybody be fighting tryna be on the top
yeah im hyping a bit charlie ignorant man they be hyping a lot
like i give a shit too late now its unlikely to
casually be killing it everybody be feeling it everybody relate to the way that wizzy be flowing
if i tell them ima do suttin ima properly do it i swear half you mandem clocked i was gone before i was glowing
its a fact if i release on a track ima jesse owen theyre watching the way im winning
watching the way im flowing and they hating
rah them man they aint contemplating
cussing hating on what youre hating on loving
the negative energy dash in a dustbin
when i roll safe walk past them man turn to my brudda like its nothing
south coast don lets end the discussion
i rep hf i rep rum com i say i rep my team to the end
you say scrap that i dont wanna buck em2embed"
