woke up in the morning to another perfect stranger
jumped into the shower to wash off the situation
i cant tell the difference if im crying or its raining
either way i know that there is something in the changes

prehook
and all i could think of is you in that sundress
and if theres a chance to be with you i promise

hook
that i will speak no evil
and i will see no darkness
and i will only only hear your voice
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil

verse 2
can you take me somewhere where the devil cannot find us
rid me of the poison that has only paralyzed us
i dont want to waste another moment here without love
and i hope theres still a space in your heart for me

prehook
and all i could think of is you in that sundress
and if theres a chance to be with you i promise
hook
that i will speak no evil
and i will see no darkness
and i will only only hear your voice
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil
you might also likeohoh no evil
ohoh no evil
ohoh no evil

prehook
and all i could think of is you in that sundress
and if theres a chance to be with you i promise
hook
that i will speak no evil
and i will see no darkness
and i will only only hear your voice
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil
til the demons go back to where they belong
speak no see no hear no evil

outro
oh put on your sundress and meet me in the sunshine
oh put on the sundress and meet me in the sunlight
speak no see no hear no evil
no evil woah
speak no see no hear no evilembed"
