all alone out in sainttropez
lookin as fine as a damn monet
tryna hydrate on perrier
everybody thirsty drinks on me
when im out clothes on lay away
tryna take back what you say to me
i dont give a damn what you say to me
there aint no time for games with me

prechorus
im moving on im getting paid
im on my own i had some space to deal with it
im moving on its getting late
go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

chorus
yeah dont even try
cant fuck up my vibe
double cuppin in the ride
motherfucker dont play with me

postchorus
motherfucker dont play with me
motherfucker dont play with me
motherfucker dont play with me

runnin lines like a marathon
got it all white like parmesan
i am not the type to be out past dawn
tomorrow got a flight headed to taiwan
now you know where the bottle gone
drippin so wet with the pérignon
i am not the type to admit im on
how could i lie when we sip so strong

prechorus
im moving on im getting paid
im on my own i had some space to deal with it
im moving on its getting late
go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

chorus
yeah dont even try
cant fuck up my vibe
double cuppin in the ride
motherfucker dont play with me

postchorus
motherfucker dont play with me
motherfucker dont play with me
motherfucker dont play with me
