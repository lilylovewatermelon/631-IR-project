now we sleep all day and party all night
im picking up my homie from the what northside
tommys on my shirt and nikes on my shoes
we rollin in the burban on them killa 22s
hit the southside and pick up 2 twins
you can take kellys booty ima do kims
cops dont like me not everyone agrees
i sag so low that my belts around my knees
bass be boomin make the girls butts wiggle
my girls gettin drunk and shes showin me her nipples
23rd and sherman i stop to get a sack
sunday afternoon i put mason on the map
cuz the dopeman got em in a 64 drop
sometimes im on elbow sometimes im on chop
dopehouse clique and we all got cloud
peace to dj lobo and my homie bill styles

i ride with my nigga lie for my nigga
smoke fry with my nigga shine with my nigga
id die for my nigga cry for my nigga
stay high with my nigga my nigga

hanging with my niggas in the hillwood grove
chickens in my kitchen cookin in my stove
imagine ive been saggin ever since i could walk
been beggin you to listen ever since i could talk
doublein my money even make it triple
ive never been a bum but im beggin for a nickel
still dippin sticks with a throwed ass bitch
workin those lips but i dont mean a kiss
roll with fuckin killers we all got straps
walkin through my hood with a woodgrain mac
slip em in a coma slangin on my cut
it took alot of work to get my block so crunk

hook spm and rasheed
cuz my posses is on broadway
i eat with my nigga sleep with my nigga
cook beef with my nigga creep with my nigga
on feet with my nigga drink with my nigga
pack heat with my nigga my nigga
my nigga

verse 3 spm
now we back in population we all got straps
run around town in trophy trucks and lacs
the wheels keep turnin im choppin up the wind
i see the ladies lookin they wanna jump in
now the front ends hoppin and the car begins to dance
my 40 ounce bottle is spillin on my pants
ridin too deep in the 4door 77
im tryin to count my tvs i think i got eleven
now we all got love for the 63 impala
ruby is the short one claimin guatemala
bobby is the mixbreed people think hes funny
behind us in the cougar and hes hoppin like a bunny
birds keep flyin i feel like a hawaiian
cuz my backyard looks like an exotic island
creepin harrisburg the party broke left
i make a uturn cuz im broadway to my death
hook spm and rasheed
cuz my posses is on broadway
i roll with my nigga smoke with my nigga
fuck hoes with my nigga blow with my nigga
buy clothes with my nigga throw with my nigga
cook dope with my nigga my nigga
my nigga
i chill with my nigga deal with my nigga
pop pills with my nigga steal for my nigga
id kill for my nigga feel my nigga
on wheels with my nigga my nigga
my nigga

outro rasheed
