when i was younger i saw
my daddy cry and curse at the wind
he broke his own heart and i watched
as he tried to reassemble it
and my mama swore that she would
never let herself forget
and that was the day that i promised
id never sing of love if it does not exist

chorus
but darling you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

verse 2
maybe i know somewhere
deep in my soul that love never lasts
and weve got to find other ways
to make it alone or keep a straight face
and ive always lived like this
keeping a comfortable distance
and up until now i had sworn
to myself that im content with loneliness
because none of it was ever worth the risk

well you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

bridge
ive got a tight grip on reality but i cant
let go of whats in front of me here
i know youre leaving in the morning when you wake up
leave me with some kind of proof its not a dream oh

chorus
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

outro
and im on my way to believing
oh and im on my way to believing51embed"
