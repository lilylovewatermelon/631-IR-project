a shadow of a man
i am nothing less
i am holding on
still holding on
and every now and then
life begins again
i am holding on
still holding on

prechorus
im not like you
your faceless lies
your weak dead heart
your black dead eyes
ill make it through
but not this time
your hope is gone
and so is mine

chorus
live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i wont live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in
im one step behind

show me where it hurts
and i will make it worse
are you holding on
keep holding on
dilated eyes
shine for one last time
are you holding on
keep holding on

prechorus
youre not like me
your faceless lies
your weak dead heart
your black dead eyes
ill break you in
and let this die
your hope is gone
and so is mine

chorus
live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i wont live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in
im one step behind
bridge
im becoming a monster
just like you
after it all
youll try to break me too
falling forever
chasing dreams
i brought you to life
so i can hear you scream

chorus
live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i wont live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in
im one step behind

outro
im one step behind
im one step behind1embed"
