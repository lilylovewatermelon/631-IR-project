if you think that a kiss is all in the lips
cmon you got it all wrong man
and if you think that our dance was all in the hips
oh well then do the twist
if you think holding hands is all in the fingers
grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
make sure to never do it with the singer
cause hell tell everyone in the world
what he was thinking about the girl
yeah what hes thinking about the girl oh

verse 2
a lot of people get confused and they bruise
real easy when it comes to love
they start putting on their shoes and walking out
and singing boy i think i had enough
just because she makes a big rumpus
she dont mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose boy
take a tip and do yourself a little service
take a mountain turn it into a mole
just by playing a different role
yeah by playing a different role oh

chorus
the boat yeah you know shes rockin it
and the truth well ya know theres no stoppin it
ah the boat yeah you know theyre still rockin it
and the truth well you know theres no stoppin it

so what somebody left you in a rut
and wants to be the one whos in control
but the feeling that youre under can really make you wonder
how the hell she can be so cold
so now youre mad denying the truth
and its hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
ya need ta spit it out in a telephone booth
while ya call everyone that you know and ask em
where do you think she goes
oh yeah where dya suppose she goes oh

chorus
the truth well you know theres no stoppin it
and the boat well you know shes still rockin it yeah
the boat well you know shes still rockin it
and the truth yeah you know theres no stoppin it

verse 4
you recognize the effect and the wreck
that its causin when she rocks the boat
but its the clause hidden in the cardinal laws
bout the proper place to hang her coat
so to you the truth is still hidden
and the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
you should know that the doctors werent kiddin
shes been singing it all along
but you were hearin a different song
yeah you were hearin a different song
but you were hearin a different song4embed"
