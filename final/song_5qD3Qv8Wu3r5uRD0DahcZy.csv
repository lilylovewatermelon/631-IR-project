bridge brian burkheiser
so i had this dream it meant everything and i watched it come alive
then i let you in underneath my skin and i learned to love the lies
now i lay awake and i contemplate have i become what i hate
can i take it back cause its all i have will it get the best of me
breakdown eric vanlerberghe
have you ever had a dream would you fight for it
would you go to war would you die for it
so now ill take my stand now ill make you see
that if you seek forgiveness youll get nothing from me
youll get nothing from me
youll get nothing from me
youll get nothing from me
