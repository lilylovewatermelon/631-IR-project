mustard on the beat ho

verse 1
i was good on my own thats the way it was
thats the way it was
you was good on the low for a faded fuck
on some faded love
shit what the fuck you complaining for
feeling jaded huh
used to trip off that shit i was kickin to you
had some fun on the run though ill give it to you

prechorus
but baby dont get it twisted
you was just another nigga on the hit list
tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
didnt they tell you that i was a savage
fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
bet you never could imagine
never told you you could have it

chorus
you needed me
ooh you needed me
to feel a little more and give a little less
know you hate to confess
but baby ooh you needed me

you been rollin around shit im rollin up
light and roll it up
break it down like a pound shit was never us
shit was never us
thats the real on the real are you serious
how you feel how you feel
used to trip off that shit i was kickin to ya
had some fun on the run though ill give it to ya

prechorus
but baby dont get it twisted
you was just another nigga on the hit list
tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
didnt they tell you that i was a savage
fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
bet you never could imagine
never told you you could have it

chorus
you needed me
ooh you needed me
to feel a little more and give a little less
know you hate to confess
but baby ooh you needed me284embed"
