if i could i would do all of this again
travel back in time with you to where this all began
we could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behind
and make believe theres something left to find

chorus
well be miles apart
ill keep you deep inside
youre always in my heart
a new life to start
i may be leaving but youre always in my heart

verse 2
now weve all grown up gone on and moved away
nothing i can do about it nothing i can say
to bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard life was not this hard
looking back it all just seems so far so far away

chorus
well be miles apart
ill keep you deep inside
youre always in my heart
a new life to start
i may be leaving but youre always in my heart

id give it up for just one more day with you
give it up for just one more day
id give it up for just one more day with you x3

chorus
well be miles apart
ill keep you deep inside
youre always in my heart
a new life to start
i may be leaving but youre always in my heart

outro
i need you now were miles apart
ill keep you deep inside
youre always in my heart
i need you now were miles apart
i may be leaving but youre always in my heart3embed"
