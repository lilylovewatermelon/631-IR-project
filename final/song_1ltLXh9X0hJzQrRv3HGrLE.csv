i love the way her blue eyes always make my day
i love the way she always knows the words to say
i love the way she falls asleep with her head on my chest
but i love the way she loves me the best
i love the way my mama swears shes the one for me
and i love the way she looks when she wears my grandmas ring
and i love the way she looked at me on the day that she said yes
but i love the way she loves me the best

chorus
cause when she loves me
she makes me feel like im the only man in this whole world
the way she loves me
makes me wonder what i would do without the girl
and of all the things she does for me i must confess
that i just love the way she loves me the best

verse 2
i love the way she knows how to put a grown man in his place
and i love the way she looks without any makeup on her face
and i love the way she tangles me in her sweet caress
i just love the way she loves me the best

chorus
cause when she loves me
she makes me feel like im the only man in this whole world
yeah the way she loves me
makes me wonder what i would do without the girl
and of all the things she does for me i must confess
that i just love the way she loves me the best
and of all the things she does for me i must confess
that i just love the way she loves me the bestsee cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeembed"
