verse 1 e40
ooh jesus christ had dreads so shake em
i aint got none but im planning on growing some
imagine all the hebrews going dumb
dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
ooh tell me when to go dumb
talking on my ghettro on the way to the store
my second or third trip
some henny some swishers and some listerine strips
dr greenthumb lips just to ease my thoughts
not just the cops but the homies you got to watch
the moon is full look at the dark clouds
sitting in my scraper watching oakland gone wild tadow
i dont bump mainstream i knock underground
all that other shit sugarcoated and watered down
im from the bay where we hyphy and go dumb
from the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

tell me when to go tell me when to go
tell me when to go tell me when to go
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
tell me when to go tell me when to go
tell me when to go tell me when to go
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

verse 2 keak da sneak
im off that 18 dummy juice
nigga raggaman labeled the black zeus
king of the super duper hyphy hyphy hyphy hyphy hyphy
pipey in your wifey you dont like me
like me like me like me like me
from the bay to the a
put me in a backwood swisher sweet blunt orange lace
lets go its dope its just some shit i wrote
my city couldnt be saved by john the pope john the pope
i slid past on the gas with the bitches at me
its good its good like the granddaddy
cross game you get flipped like a burger patty
or zigzagged pass me a big old fatty
i drink white with a snow bunny
talking big shit in the scraper going hella dummy
1800 jose cuervo
yadadamean yadada im saying though
chorus
tell me when to go tell me when to go
tell me when to go tell me when to go
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
tell me when to go tell me when to go
tell me when to go tell me when to go
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

interlude e40
now let me direct traffic for a minute

now let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the bay
when i say something you say it right back to me you smell me
were gonna do it like this right here

bridge e40
