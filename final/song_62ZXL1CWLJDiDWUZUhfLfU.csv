verse 1
i mixed up so terribly
your body language talkin over me
and it might not be logical
but baby my mind just wont let you leave

prechorus
and i crave your taste under my tongue every day
all day
keep the forbidden fruit comin my way
i wanna feel your sugar in my veins
baby just wanna feel

chorus
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine ahh
you sip what the devils drinkin
hot as hell and im thinkin
baby baby baby can you take away my pain
baby baby baby can you take away my pain
