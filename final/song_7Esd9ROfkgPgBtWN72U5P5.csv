and she lays down on her bedroom floor
the chemicals that make her laugh
dont seem to be working anymore
she tries her best but it hurts her chest
and even though her sun is gone
shed like to love her child nevertheless

verse 2
my hair is brown shes scared to touch
and she just wants to feel something
and i dont think thats asking for too much
and when i go to sleep is when she begins to weep

chorus
shes appalled by not loving me at all
she wears a frown and dressing gown
when she lays down

verse 3
we got a plane oh to see my dad again
she prayed that wed fall from the sky
simply to alleviate the pain
over water hmm
over terrain
the engines all go bust we turned to dust
and ive no reason to complain yeah
and in the end she chose cocaine
but it couldnt fix her brain

shes appalled
oh she doesnt love me at all
she wears a frown and dressing gown
when she lays down
