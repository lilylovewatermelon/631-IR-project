by now you should know everything you say
can and will be used against you someday
i got the microphone so dont go too far
cause im gonna tell the whole world how you really are

i dont even care how youre gonna feel
cause ive already tried to give you something real
so go ahead and get mad never talk to me again
i dont even care cause i got my revenge

chorus
revenge
revenge
got my revenge

refrain
one night youre begging me to stay
the next night you push me away
i dont need your promise i give it up
its too late cause now im giving up

chorus
revenge
revenge
got my revenge
