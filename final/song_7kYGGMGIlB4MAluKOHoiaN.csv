mother earth has changed since i was a child
the east is a beast and the west is really wild
and the headlines say the end looks grim
and the future dont look so bright
you cant even open your mailbox you cant take the plane
and everybody looking for somebody to blame
i think im going to let the president
save this old world tonight

ill light us a fire
and shell turn off the news
well open a cold one and shake these blues

chorus
its all good
its alright
im going to sit here with my baby all night
and let the troubles of this world
roll on by us like they should
its all cool
its okay
weve got everything going our way
cant complain if were alright
its all good

im just a regular joe with a beautiful girl
just getting by in a daytoday world
we aint got a lot but we dont need anything
covered in kisses surrounded by love
showered with blessings from up above
when you’re sitting on top of the world man we got everything

we live out here in the country
where the working class do
weve got our health and our happiness too

chorus
its all good
its alright
im going to sit here with my baby all night
and let the troubles of this world
roll on by us like they should
its all cool
its okay
weve got everything going our way
cant complain if were alright
its all good

outro
no cant complain cause were alright
and its all goodembed"
