only keep the loud on me
in the morning asking dont fake it with me

verse 1
when theres six grams in the blunt
and thirty ounces of vodka lets head dive in the truth
im fucking somebodys daughter
spend my tithes on bape
but somehow still getting richer
spend 10 bands girl for you and your twin sister
the truth will set you free
now i need you to open up for me
the moon will set you free
500 shed some light on me
nodding off bobblehead
the whole squad looking out for me
last time on the meds
first time on the balcony
