you shouldve been there
shouldve burst through the door
with that baby im right here smile
and it wouldve felt like
a million little shining stars had just aligned
and i wouldve been so happy

verse 2
christmas lights glisten
ive got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how ive been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said youd be here
you said youd be here

chorus
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all laughing
as im looking around the room
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likeverse 3
and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when theres something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
he said hed be here

chorus
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing missing
and that was the moment i knew

bridge
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didnt show
breakdown
you shouldve been here
and i wouldve been so happy

chorus
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all standing around me singing
happy birthday to you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
ohohohohohohoh i knew
ohohohohohohoh

outro
you called me later
and said im sorry i didnt make it
and i said im sorry too
and that was the moment i knew21embed"
