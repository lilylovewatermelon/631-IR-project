i remember when you were all mine
watched you changing in front of my eyes
what can i say
now that im not the fire in the cold
now that im not the hand that you hold
as youre walking away

chorus
will you call me to tell me youre alright
cause ill worry about you the whole night
dont repeat my mistakes
i wont sleep til youre safe inside
if youre home i just hope that youre sober
is it time to let go now youre older
dont leave me this way
i wont sleep til youre safe inside

verse 2
everyone has to find their own way
and im sure things will work out okay
i wish that was the truth
all we know is the sun will rise
thank your lucky stars that youre alive
its a beautiful life
