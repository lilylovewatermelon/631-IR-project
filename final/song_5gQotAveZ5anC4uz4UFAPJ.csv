you said to never ever come back
i wasnt sure exactly what you meant by that
i know that we have had some problems
but ive got solutions in my head

chorus
so i jumped out the window
and down the fire escape
broke the window who needs car keys anyway
climbed through the window i thought led to your heart
thrown out the window there was nothing there to break my fall
break my fall

verse 2
sorry i sent you all the flowers
i heard your boyfriend wants to shove them up my ass
i never meant to cause you problems
but ive got solutions in my head

chorus
so i jumped out the window
and down the fire escape
broke the window who needs car keys anyway
climbed through the window i thought led to your heart
thrown out the window there was nothing there to break my fall
break my fall
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
you said its over
you said never again
why does this happen all the time
you dont even want to be friends
it makes you happy when i cry
now all ive got left is my sanity
now all ive got left is my sanity
and im not sure how far it goes
how far it goes

so i jumped out the window

break my fall
thrown out the window
break my fall
thrown out the window
break my fall
thrown out the window
break my fall
