go on and call me up
tell me you made a grave mistake
you know i never once turned you away
bad as i hate to say
i know how good its going to be
if just for a night i lay you down by me

chorus
and you lie
like you won’t say goodbye
like you do every time
come here and kiss me
and act like you miss me
make me believe were together
come here and hold me
and baby control me
touch me like youll be here forever
you never cut me deep enough to tell you no
oh
tell me you love me
itll hurt a lot worse when you go

and you lie
like you won’t say goodbye
like you do every time
come here and kiss me
and act like you miss me
make me believe were together
come here and hold me
and baby control me
touch me like youll be here forever
you never cut me deep enough to tell you no
oh
tell me you love me
itll hurt a lot worse when you go
oh
tell me you love me
itll hurt a lot worse when you go
you never cut me deep enough to tell you no
