verse 1
he the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
might breeze through the ave might stop at the gym
and he keep a dorag keep the wave on swim
wwwaves on swim so they hate on him
anyway i think i met him sometime before
in a different life or where i record
i mean he was adam i think i was eve
but my vision ends with the apple on the tree
s on my chest cause im ready to save him
ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
and i think i love him i love him just like i raised him
when he call me mama lil mama i call him baby

verse 2
he the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
just left money gram in the lemon lamb
hot damn make me scream like summer jam
i mean that nigga must be from the motherland
anyway i think i met him in the sky
when i was a geisha he was a samurai
somehow i understood him when he spoke thai
never spoke lies and he never broke fly
s on my chest let me get my cape on
hes so thugged out ghostface and raekwon
convict just like akon
cause you know the snitches be putting the jake on
