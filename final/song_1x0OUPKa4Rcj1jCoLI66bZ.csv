did you see the news last night
they shot another one down
does it even matter why
or is it all for nothing

chorus
father who art in heaven
is this how you saw it when you made your creation
is this what you wanted
is this what you wanted

postchorus
maybe we’ll never know
or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky when we die
when we die
when we die yeah

verse 2
took her to the moon last night
little bit of weed a little wine
left everything else behind
no plans on coming home

chorus
father who art in heaven
this is what you’ve started it’s your creation
is this what you wanted what
is this what you wanted
you might also likebridge
rather watch the world burn down
from a penthouse cloud real talk
but if this is what you want i’ll fight ’til the
smokefilled skies make the days turn night then what
maybe when the world burns down
and the clouds turns black
and the sky turns white
and the days turn night
it’s a war outside
it’s a war outside
it’s a war outside

postchorus
or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky
when we die when we die
when we die yeah
