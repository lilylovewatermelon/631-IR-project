he says adios says adios
and do you know why
she wont break down and cry
she says adios says adios goodbye

one by one my leaves fall
one by one my tales are told

its no lie
she is yearning to fly
she says adios says adios

hes a reason to sigh
she says adios says adios goodbye

she was aiming too high
he says adios says adios
and now you know why
theres no moon in her sky
he says adios says adios goodbye
he says adios says adios goodbye
