laying on a dark beach
pulsing waves cover me
flowers bloom on the sea
silver sand underneath

chorus
talk to me as i am sleeping
hold me while im dreaming
honestly i could just breathe you in
met you when my heart was bleeding
im constantly feeling
drifting through an endless reverie

verse 2
twilight moon interlude
fell in love in my youth
on a cloud not a sound
silent kiss just like this

chorus
talk to me as i am sleeping
hold me while im dreaming
honestly i could just breathe you in
met you when my heart was bleeding
im constantly feeling
drifting through an endless reverieyou might also like8embed"
