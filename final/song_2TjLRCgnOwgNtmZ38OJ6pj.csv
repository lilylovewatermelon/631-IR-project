oh i miss the comfort of this house
where we are where we are where we are where we are
the floor under our feet whispers out
come on in come on in where it all begins

chorus nanna
can you chase the fire away
can you chase the fire away

verse 2 ragnar ragnar  band
we climbed up to the top in wornout shoes
but she ran down she ran down she ran down to the house
a fox that gains our trust but then breaks it as he walks
away from us away from us

chorus nanna
can you chase the fire away
can you chase the fire away
ooh ooh oohooh in the fall we sleep all day
ooh ooh oohooh in the fall we sleep all day

refrain nanna band
where we are where we are
we sleep all day where we are where we are
where we are where we are
we sleep all day where we are where we are
where we are where we are
we sleep all day where we are where we are

can you chase the fire away
can you chase the fire away
ooh ooh oohooh in the fall we sleep all day
ooh ooh oohooh in the fall we sleep all day
