intro
a loved one laid his head in her lap
red roses fell to the floor
and the world stood still

verse 1
my mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
i didnt know what love was on that day
hearts a tiny blood clot i picked at it
it never heals it never goes away

prechorus
burned all the good things in the eden eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die
burned all the good things in the eden eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

chorus
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay

verse 2
i would have told her then she was the only thing
that i could love in this dying world
but the simple word of love itself
already died and went away

this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay

prechorus
burned all the good things in the eden eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die
burned all the good things in the eden eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

chorus
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay
this was never my world you took the angel away
id kill myself to make everybody pay

outro
her hearts a bloodstained egg we didnt handle with care
its broken and bleeding and we could never repair
her hearts a bloodstained egg we didnt handle with care
its broken and bleeding and we could never repair
and we can never repair7embed"
