over and over i done told ya boy
im a gunit motherfucking soldier boy
and when you gon get it in your brain
the gates wide open and the dogs off the chain

verse 1 50 cent
i be that youngin with that gun that’s tellin ya stop frontin
i be that yougin on the run after i pop somethin
in the bible i read death is of the tongue
and if you talk about death enough death is gon come
jay taught me how to flow they shot him in the head
randy ass was there now he runnin scared
some say im gangsta some say im crazy
if you ask me ill say im what the hood made me
now i can stunt til my ass dead broke like jd
or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
see im cool with them haitian mob niggas
they say sak pase nap boule and rob niggas
the media be tryin to make a nigga look bad whats with that
see my flick next to preme papi and cat
and montana i kill em with the grammar
i enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
x what up aight

i smell murder every time that the wind blow
tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
i don’t want the throne or the crown i ain’t sell enough

and niggas is gettin shot down two guns up
