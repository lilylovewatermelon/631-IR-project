its the start of the end surrender the throne
the blood on my hands covered the holes
weve been surrounded by vicious cycles
and were truly alone
the scars on your heart are yours to atone
weve been surrounded let em sing let em sing

verse
the deeper you dig the darker it gets
theres nowhere else for us to go
we live what we learn and then we forget
well never find our way back home come on

prechorus
they came like moths to a flame
you left like a house in a hurricane
the wolves are at my door

chorus
its the start of the end surrender the throne
the blood on my hands covered the holes
weve been surrounded by vicious cycles
its the start of the end and were truly alone
the scars on your heart are yours to atone
weve been surrounded let em sing let em sing
you might also likebreakdown
i hear em clawing at the gates let us in let us in
i hear them calling out my name i dont care
let them sing let them sing let them sing
let the bastards sing let them sing let them sing
let the bastards sing let them sing let them sing
let the bastards sing let the godforsaken bastards sing

prechorus
they came like moths to a flame
you left like a house in a hurricane
the wolves are at my door
but i cant see the writing on the walls
the wolves are at my door
waiting for my empire to fall

chorus
its the start of the end surrender the throne
the blood on my hands covered the holes
weve been surrounded by vicious cycles
its the start of the end and were truly alone
the scars on your heart are yours to atone
weve been surrounded let em sing let em sing22embed"
