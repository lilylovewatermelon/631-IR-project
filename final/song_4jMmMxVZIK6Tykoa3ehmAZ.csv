intro
im a do my thing
im a do im a do im a do my thing

verse 1
i was born at the end of december
not afraid that the cold of the winter
would keep me inside hey
ever since mama left me at home
i had to search for a class of my own
and go there in my mind

verse 2
i had a dream like dr king
i had a song i had to sing
and i knew it wasnt make believe
when the teacher said to me
baby who do you wanna be
said i dont know but i know that im a gonna leave

chorus
im so gone just you
all i do is walk alone just me
im so gone just you
i can make it on my own just me
alright

but i belong in the front singing loud
and ill go solo hey
but the fame is a hell of a temptress
not my wife but i guess shes a mistress oh

verse 4
she can play tricks on your mind
have you leave your soul behind
shes turned some niggas out
but she cant keep her spell on me
she cant keep blackmailing me
im free to leave to be just me

chorus
im so gone just you
all i do is walk alone just me
im so gone just you
i can make it on my own just me
alright
