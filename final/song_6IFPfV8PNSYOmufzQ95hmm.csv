rusty barbed wire lines these fields
gravel dust behind the wheels
driftin like my mind into the rearview
jet trails cuttin cross the sky
im rollin through the open wide
searchin for a song to drink a beer to
and tryin to find a place to disappear to

chorus
i light up the night and let it burn
lean back and watch a sundown fade
do what i do when lifes a little sideways
i take a sip and say a prayer
wait for a shootin star and stare
off at the headlights on the highway
that guy in the windshield lookin back looks just like me
but theres a crack in the reflection
this is just a moonlight soaked ring of smoke
right hand on a cold one confession

verse 2
embers in the ashtray glow like memories that wont let go
im out here tryin to get em untangled
in the darkness on the edge of town
a little lost a little found
waitin on a call from an angel
you might also likechorus
i light up the night and let it burn
lean back and watch a sundown fade
do what i do when lifes a little sideways
i take a sip and say a prayer
wait for a shootin star and stare
off at the headlights on the highway
that guy in the windshield lookin back looks just like me
but theres a crack in the reflection
this is just a moonlight soaked ring of smoke
right hand on a cold one confession

instrumental break

chorus
i light up the night and let it burn
lean back and watch a sundown fade
do what i do when lifes a little sideways
i take a sip and say a prayer
wait for a shootin star and stare
off at the headlights on the highway
that guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
but theres a crack in the reflection
hope hes movin in the right direction
this is just a moonlight soaked ring of smoke
right hand on a cold one confession8embed"
