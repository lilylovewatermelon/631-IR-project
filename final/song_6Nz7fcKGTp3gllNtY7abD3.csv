verse 1
in the mornings i was anxious
it was better just to stay in bed
didnt want to fail myself again
running through all the options and the endings
were rolling out in front of me
but i couldnt choose a thread to begin

chorus
ohohohoh
and i could not love
cause i could not love myself ohohohoh
never good enough no
that was all id tell myself ohohohoh
and i was not well ohohohoh
but i could not help myself ohohohoh
i was giving up on living ohohohoh

verse 2
in the morning you were leaving
travelling south again
and you said you were not unprepared
and all the dead ends and disappointments
were fading from your memory
ready for that lonely life to end

bridge
ohohohoh
and you gave me love ohohohoh
when i could not love myself ohohohoh
and you made me turn ohohohoh
from the way i saw myself ohohohoh
and youre patient love ohohohoh
and you help me help myself ohohohoh
and you save me ohohohoh
yeah you save me ohohohoh
yeah you save me
