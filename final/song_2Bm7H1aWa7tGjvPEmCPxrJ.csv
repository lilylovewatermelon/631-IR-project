what turns a boy into a man
you gotta search alone and worthy
but thatll make a lonely girl
that has the top and that rules the world
a king who choose his crown over his queen

before he gets the notion he doesnt need you
before the motion grows your plan proceeds to

say what about me
say what about me
look at all the heads im turning in the street
well my oh my dont you realize
one thing should be on your mind
what about me

you meet his friends you meet his folks
you love his songs you love his jokes
you show him all the moves hes never seen
then you take his will away
you never go a single day without asking him
with whom or where hes been

you do it all to show him what hes worth
the last things its about is helping her
see lake street dive liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likesay what about me
say what about me
look at all the heads im turning in the street
well my oh my dont you realize
one thing should be on your mind
what about me

i have lived a privileged life
but i have seen my share of strife
and nothing beats the boy thats leaving me
i might have pushed a little hard
i might have took it way too far
but youve got respect consistency

thats why the next time i wont wait to fall
you know me i wont hesitate to

say what about me
say what about me
look at all the heads im turning in the street
well my oh my dont you realize
one thing should be on your mind
what about meembed"
