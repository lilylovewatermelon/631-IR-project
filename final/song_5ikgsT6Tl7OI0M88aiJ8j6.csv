dear diamond
pretty and new
perfectly flawless too good to be true
dear diamond
you shine like the sun
wrap around my finger just like he does

verse 2
you cost more than he wanted to lose
and with this ring i said i do
promised to never do what i’ve done
i’ve been lying to someone

verse 3
dear diamond
what will we do
lie like the devil or just face the truth
dear diamond
be my saving grace
what he don’t know will kill him
that i can’t face

verse 4
you cost more than he wanted to lose
and with this ring i said i do
i promised to never do what i’ve done
i’ve been lying to someone

this secret i have while he’s holding meembed"
