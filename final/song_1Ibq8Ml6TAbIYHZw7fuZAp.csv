maybe this is forever
forever fades away
like a rocket ascending into space
could you not be sad
could you not break down
after all wont let go

chorus
til youre safe and sound
til youre safe and sound
theres beauty in release
theres no one left to please
but you and me

verse 2
i dont blame you for quitting
i know you really try
if only you could hang on through the night
cause i dont wanna be lonely
i dont wanna be scared
but all our friends are waiting there

chorus
until youre safe and sound
until youre safe and sound
theres beauty in release
theres no one left to please
but you and me
