chorus
allwhite gucci suit im feeling righteous yeah
i know that the truth is hard to digest yeah
five or six pills in my right hand yeah
codeine runneth over on my nightstand
takin medicine to fix all of the damage
my anxiety the size of a planet yeah oh
holes in my skull over time
my hearts over ice woah

verse 1
over ice im freezing
beautiful eyes deceiving
we may die this evening
coughing wheezing bleeding
high im a anxious soul
blood moons in my eyes stay low
red and black they glow
under attack in my soul
when its my time ill know
never seen a hell so cold
yeah well make it out i know
well run right through the flames lets go

verse 2
im in too deep
cant swim like me
were drowning so i will sink
my demons ten feets under me
inhale exhale but i cant breathe
too busy drinking codeine doin high speeds
crash pour a four sip it slow make the time pass
take a pill for the thrill have a relapse
devil in my head tryna run gym laps
i aint tryna race he dont even know me like that
