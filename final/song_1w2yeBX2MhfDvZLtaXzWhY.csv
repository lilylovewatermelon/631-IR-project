baby you pretend that things aint what they seem
all this tension telling me just exactly what we should be
now i dont mind us bein some kind of casual thing
listen all i wanna do for now is have you come and take all of me

chorus
can you put your hands on my waistline
want your skin up against mine
move my hips to the baseline
let me get mine you get yours
hang a please dont disturb sign
put my back into a slow grind slow grind
sending chills up and down my spine
let me get mine you get yours

verse 2
if you see me with a man understand that you cant question me
the feelings that you caught aint my fault
cant help your jealousy
if you can handle the fact
that what we have has got to be commitment free free
then we can keep this undercover lovin comin
hidden underneath the sheets

chorus
can you put your hands on my waistline ooh on my waistline
want your skin up against mine
move my hips to the baseline
let me get mine you get yours we dont fall in love
hang a please dont disturb sign
put my back into a slow grind slow grind
sending chills up and down my spine
let me get mine you get yours

now listen so come on and freak my body
we can get nasty naughty all night a private party
gotta hit that spot just right work me like a nine to five

gotta hit that spot just right work me like a nine to five

spoken bridge
we have a physical thing
we make love but dont fall in love

we spend time just enough so you get yours and i get mine
no strings attached
i want your body not your heart
let me get mine you get yours

chorus
