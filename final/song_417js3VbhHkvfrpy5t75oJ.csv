if you got a man and youre tired of being there
and done gave him too many chances and tired of being fair
i offer you the opportunity to ride with a playa
you me and a couple of freaks in the ride with a playa
nevermind those outside when they stare
cause the chrome 24s on the ride give a glare
because its one guy and you decided to share
as long as youre having the time of your life who cares
man we all sinners what matters is in the center
i know god see the heart and im a stand up nigga
you cant beat me cause you aint man enough nigga
i look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga

i know the niggas hatin on me cause i live so special
try to stay low key but its still so special
flat screens in the floor quarter mil in the dresser
jewelry box glowin like long lost treasure
im chillin with vanessa met a girl named heather
told her hi how ya doin buy a drink my pleasure
told her if she got a homegirl go tell her that i got a hard rug i could go forever
if vanessa wanna touch it just let her
she laughed out loud but shocked cause we just met her
bought the dro get low and its only onefifth
and its four pills left do you wanna come with

chorus

if you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
because the rocks gon glisten and the drops on 20s

if you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
because it dont get betta niggas dont get cheddar
