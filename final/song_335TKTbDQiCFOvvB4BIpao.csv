here comes that same old memory
like a movie in my mind
you told me you loved another
then you drove off through the pines
and i swear it feels like yesterday
though its been a long long time
i can still feel those cold chills
runnin up and down my spine

and ive been fighting back the memories
ive been fightin back the tears
and im fightin back the hurt i still feel
after all these years
if i had the strength id fight
to make things like they were before
but im just too tired
to fight it anymore

everyday my heart reminds me
how i boldly spoke those lines
i can get along without you
and im gonna be just fine
but the nights alone grew colder
than i ever thought theyd be
and i spend every hour searchin
for what you took out of me

ive been fightin back the tears
and im fightin back the hurt i still feel
after all these years
if i had the strength id fight
to make things like they were before
but im just too tired
to fight it anymore

and i thought time would overcome the torture
but instead im getting weaker everyday

yeah
whoa
ive been fighting back the memories
ive been fighting back the tears
and im fighting back the hurt i still feel
after all these years
if i had the strength id fight
to make things like they were before
but im just too tired to fight
there aint no way to hide it
im just too tired to fight it anymore
yeah im just too tired to fight it anymoreembed"
