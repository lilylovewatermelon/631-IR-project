use a lighter hand
ive got bruses you cant see
you can take your time
your love is all i need
they say time is a healer
but its been no friend to me
ive had a share of heartache
ive had my fill of pain
girl you took away the hurt
and stopped the falling rain
i know you walk on water
i know that you can heal me

chorus
heal me
with your sweet and sexy ways
feel me
your touch is all i crave
ive been waiting for so long
for you to come along
and heal me

verse 2
girl dont cut yourself
on my broken heart
watch for the jagged pieces
they might tear you apart
oh once you touch my soul
i know that you can heal me

verse 3
oh
heal me
stars are aligned
theyre in perfect harmony
love is the position
that you pour on me

chorus
heal me
with your sweet and sexy ways
feel me
your touch is all i crave
ive been waiting for so long
for you to come along
