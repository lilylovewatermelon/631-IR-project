i just want the money
cause i heard the money bring you power
now a nigga on top
i remember i hit rock bottom
i dont wanna be yo friend
i already know you niggas sour
hoe that aint my dna
i already know i aint the father

verse 1
lil kids look up to me like im they father like im they daddy
run up on me like kodak give me a dollar i give them five dollars
girl when i first met you you was smaller girl you was so small
since i start hittin its like that booty gettin larger
i just touchdown on yo ass feel like tiki barber
now a nigga wearing hugo boss remember when starter when it starter
i just picked a pack up like brett favre like brett favre
i just want to buy my mom a car my mom a bentley
stop right there girl we cant go no further baby stop it
no not listerine but shawty love to gargle no not mouthwash
lil cool nigga but im hot like lava hot like lava
swimming in the money i need goggles swimming in the money

chorus
i just want the money
cause i heard the money bring you power
now a nigga on top
i remember i hit rock bottom
i dont wanna be yo friend
i already know you niggas sour
hoe that aint my dna
i already know i aint the father

i already know about you lil homie
i just checked your resume boy you a phony
oh my god i hope that aint the police
cause i got a 30 clip on me

looking for me i be on the ugly
in the projects right on 1800

chorus
i just want the money
cause i heard the money bring you power
now a nigga on top
i remember i hit rock bottom
i dont wanna be yo friend
i already know you niggas sour
hoe that aint my dna
i already know i aint the fatherembed"
