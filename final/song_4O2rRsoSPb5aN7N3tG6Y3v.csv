breathin in breathin out
how you been you settled down
you feelin right you feelin proud
how are your kids where are they now

prechorus
you build a boat you build a life
you lose your friends you lose your wife
you settle in to routine
where are you what does it mean

chorus
if i get too close and im not how you hoped
forgive my northern attitude oh i was raised out in the cold
if the sun dont rise til the summertime
forgive my northern attitude oh i was raised on little light

verse 2
bought some shit you search online
youre gettin lost youre gettin high
all alone late in life
scared to live scared to die

prechorus
you build a boat you build a life
you lose your kids you lose your wife
you settle down youre feelin lost
youre gettin stoned then kickin rocks one two three four
