i got a faulty parachute i got a strangers friend
an exciting change in my butchers blend
a symbol on the ceiling with the flick of a switch
yeah my newfound hero in the enemys ditching

verse 2
well somebodys something was left in the room
and man now that its gone well of course we assume
that somebody else needed something so bad
that they took everything that somebody had

chorus
losing hope is easy
when your only friend is gone
and every time you look around
well it all it all just seems to change

verse 3
the mark was left man its never the same
next time that you shoot make sure that you aim
open windows with passing cars
a brand new night with the same old stars

chorus
losing hope is easy
when your only friend is gone
and every time you look around
well it all it all just seems to change

feed the fool
a piece of the pie
make a fool of his system
make a fool of his mind
give him bottles of lies
and maybe hell find
his place in heaven
because he might just die

chorus
losing hope is easy
when your only friend is gone
and every time you look around
well it all it all just seems to change

outro
but hanging on is easy
when youve got a friend to call
when nothings making sense at all
youre not the only one thats afraid of changeembed"
