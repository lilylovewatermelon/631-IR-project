its amazing the time that its taken
for you to come out here
i dont know what you do in there
only so many ways you can change
how light will hit your face
or how you can fix your hair

prechorus 1
you only got two eyes two lips so why
it shouldnt really take long at all
but when you finally smile cause its just right
damn you look beautiful

chorus
you take forever ever ever ever
but youre always worth waiting for
you take forever ever ever ever
i guess ill wait a little more
now i know its time i realize
i will be waiting half my life
with my back up against the door
cause you take forever ever ever ever ever ever ever
but youre always worth waiting for

verse 2
and you lie through your teeth
when you try to convince me that youll be
that youll be out in less than five
cause we both know that the only way you will ever leave
is if we set the whole place on fire

you already said you had the perfect dress
so why you got to try them all
no matter how late it gets i must confess
damn you look beautiful

chorus
you take forever ever ever ever
but youre always worth waiting for
you take forever ever ever ever
i guess ill wait a little more
now i know its time i realize
i will be waiting half my life
with my back up against the door
cause you take forever ever ever ever ever ever ever
but youre always worth waiting for

outro
you take forever ever ever ever
i guess ill wait a little more
