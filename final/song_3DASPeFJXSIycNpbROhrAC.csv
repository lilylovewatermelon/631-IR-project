joke me something awful just like kisses on the necks of best friends
were the kids who feel like dead ends
and i want to be known for my hits not just my misses
i took a shot and didnt even come close

prechorus 1
at trust and love and hope
and the poets are just kids who didnt make it
and never had it at all

chorus
and the record wont stop skipping
and the lies just wont stop slipping
and besides my reputations on the line
we can fake it for the airwaves
force our smiles baby halfdead
from comparing myself to everyone else around me

verse 2
please put the doctor on the phone cause im not making any sense
blame everyone but me for this mess
and my back has been breaking from this heavy heart
we never seemed so far

prechorus 2
im hopelessly hopeful youre just hopeless enough
but we never had it at all
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
and the record wont stop skipping
and the lies just wont stop slipping
and besides my reputations on the line
we can fake it for the airwaves
force our smiles baby halfdead
from comparing myself to everyone else around me

outro
to everyone else around me
everyone else around me
everyone else around me11embed"
