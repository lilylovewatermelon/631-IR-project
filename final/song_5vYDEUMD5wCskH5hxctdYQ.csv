dressed in holiday style
in the air theres a feeling of christmas

children laughing people passing
meeting smile after smile
and on every street corner youll hear

silver bells silver bells
its christmas time in the city
ringaling hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day eve

city street lights even stoplights

blinking bright red and green
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures

hear the snow crunch
see the kids bunch
this is santas big scene
and above all the bustle youll hear

silver bells silver bells
silver bells silver bells
its christmastime in the city
ringaling hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day
soon it will be christmas dayyou might also likeembed"
