verse 1 2pac
just holla my name and witness game official
niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
while i remain inside a paradox called my block
though gunshots is promised to me when will i stop
i hit the weed and hope to god i can fly high
witness my enemies die when i ride by
they shouldnt have tried me
i send they bodies to they parents up north
with they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off
fuck em all what i scream as i dream in tongues
fuck a trick get me rich and the bitchesll come
bust my gun make em all scatter
bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
eat a dick biyotch mercy never that you say you comin back
bring it on forever strapped
introduce you to the pleasure and the pain you can go so far
just sell me your soul and live the life of a ghetto star

i live the life of a thug nigga drug dealer livin game tight
mug niggas slug niggas for the fame life
laced with game practice on takin pain
quick to slang and let it rain through yo brain
street smart proficient intelligent
and keep suckers hittin til snitches start smellin it
movin niggas with telekinesis
keepin channel 7 at work filmin different features
leadin niggas to an early death with they head blown
and to those who didnt make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
and hope niggas got punished
kidnapped jacked in the back with macs to they neck rappers waitin to get done in
back tat at him we tossed his ass out
mob related one mo nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin g
now the next generations lookin up to me life as a ghetto star

verse 3 2pac
walkin through the cemetery talkin to my homies that was buried
see my enemies wanna see me dead i aint worried forgive me
please give me shelter calm my fears
lifted my head from my hands had a palm of tears
i see bodies gettin splashed with acid
two shots rang from the plastic glock wrapped in plastic
buried the bastard time to notify
his family shit aint nothing left to be identified
evacuate the crime scene fast
why i heard the feds had a warrant for my ass
fly i wont touch down til i see tijuana
set up a shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
label me a success i made the switch
retired from the life that never gave me shit
but cash that i couldnt spend countless cars
an addict for a wife my life as a ghetto star
verse 4 nuttso
got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
hit the curve let it swerve had to stop they grip
no remorse no repentance as i buck one down
straight to the morgue cause i plan on shuttin shit down
born soldier fucked em up with a macfo
torn ligaments all up in that nigga shoulder
and a vest couldnt protect that flesh
cause i got slugs to knock the air out your chest
death apparently they wasnt sucka free
cause i had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
i guess they heard that i got them birds
thought i was a nerd til i bucked one of them to the curb
luxury livin lavish with dreams of dyin rich
with a team and clientele on my mothafuckin dick
and gettin down on these snitch bitches protectin riches
by givin stitches the life as a ghetto star

interlude 2pac
when i grow up i wanna be like them
my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
live my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
and live my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
live my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
and live my life as a ghetto star
outro 2pac w nuttso talking in background
this goes out to all you motherfuckers to all you motherfuckers

all you niggas on the block sellin rocks
hand to hand runnin from the police sellin motherfuckin dopes
