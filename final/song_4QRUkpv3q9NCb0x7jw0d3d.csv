we both said some things i know we never meant
and when i slammed the door tonight you wondered where i went
if i know you youre probably wondering what to do
youre thinking that im gone for good if i know you

chorus
but if i know me ill turn this car around
i wont get halfway through town and ill be sorry
ill stop and call and youll say youre sorry too
and ill come running back to you if i know me

verse 2
sometimes i lose my head say things to break your heart
forgetting if i lost your love it would tear my world apart
if i know you you didnt mean one single thing you said
truth be known youre dying crying lying there in bed

chorus

outro
