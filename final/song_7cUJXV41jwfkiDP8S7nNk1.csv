i dont write rhymes i grab the pen and let my soul talk
walkin with jesus he saved my soul this a soul walk

now my soul cryin to the lord thats the real plug
thuggin and druggin and stealin cars is my history
now my soul cryin to the lord i got the victory
was slippin on razor blade alley the alcohol river
now im filled with the holy ghost and i make demons shiver
