chorus
all of my niggas some shooters most of em they be trappin
aint no pretending we live like this no acting
you better watch out for your friends cause niggas be hatin
the minute they feel like they know you theyll try to play you
but im ready for anything strapped with that burner every time im rollin
city to city just me and my shorty
tried sellin me dreams i aint never bought em
livin life on the edge now we start to fallin

verse 1
they gave up on a nigga you know what i mean
since younger than this i been chasing my dreams
on double xl but not the magazine
locked in that cell missed alot of things
thinkin bout how to take over the game
i gotta make my way outta the ring
my heart full of hatred my chest full of pain
my heart full of hatred my chest full of pain
four deep in the whip while we trap out the range
we up in br took a break from the stage
my nigga tryna figure out what i made
for my chain they dont know what i paid
i aint have no money i remember them days
