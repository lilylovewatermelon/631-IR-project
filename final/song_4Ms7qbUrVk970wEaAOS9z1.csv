verse 2 7th ward lord
yung pimp from gentilly
where the concrete littered with them empty philly blunt wraps
where the liquor floods racks in my safe kept safe
7th ward by the lake come and see me
bitch im sick like a plague uh
hold up lil woadie
that aint what he told me
uptown killers by the river is nothing holy
except for your white tee red dots bleedin in the hot sun
time to grab an ice tea survival is unlikely
gorilla in the tank yelling where they at
reminiscent of the 1990s
platinum fucking blades chopping up the tracks
hoodrats acting fiesty murder murder nightly

chorus 7th ward lord
if you from the 7th ward wont you make noise
them fucking grey gorillas by the lake uicideboy
if you from the north shore wont you make noise
them fucking grey gorillas by the lake uicideboy
if you from the west bank wont you make noise
them fucking grey gorillas by the lake uicideboy
if you from the crescent city wont you make noise
them fucking grey gorillas by the lake uicideboy
outro kangol slim  7th ward lord
my hot girl and your hot girl were sittin by the bayou
my hot girl told your hot girl i got a hot boy that is fire
talking bout a hot boy hot girl
hot boy hot girl
