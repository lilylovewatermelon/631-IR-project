step one you say we need to talk
he walks you say sit down its just a talk
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
you begin to wonder why you came

chorus
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life

verse 2
let him know that you know best
cause after all you do know best
try to slip past his defense
without granting innocence
lay down a list of what is wrong
the things youve told him all along
and pray to god he hears you
and i pray to god he hears you and
you might also likechorus
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life

verse 3
as he begins to raise his voice
you lower yours and grant him one last choice
drive until you lose the road
or break with the ones youve followed
he will do one of two things
he will admit to everything
or hell say hes just not the same
and youll begin to wonder why you came

chorus
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life

chorus
where did i go wrong i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life

somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
