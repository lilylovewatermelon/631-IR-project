you told me boy look the other way
you told me boy bite your tongue
yes thats not the way
yeah thats not the way
ah thats just not the way that friends behave
ah thats just not the way that friends behave
oh no no no no no no no

chorus
you lined me up across the room
two falling sparks one willing fool
and i i always knew
that i would love you from afar

verse 2
you told me boy look the other way
you told me boy hide those hands
well ive been living on the crumbs of your love
and im starving now
and that is just the way that we remain
oh that will be the way that we remain
oh no no no no no no no

chorus
you lined me up across the room
two falling sparks one willing fool
and i i always knew
that i would love you from afar
you lined me up across the room
two falling sparks one willing fool
and i i always knew
that i would love you from afar
