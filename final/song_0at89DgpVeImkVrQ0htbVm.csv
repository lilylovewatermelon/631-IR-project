this is the year where hope fails you
the test subjects run the experiments
and the bastard you know is the hero you hate
but cohesion is possible if we try
theres no reason theres no lesson
no time like the present
tell me right now what have you got to lose
what have you got to lose except your soul
whos with us

verse 1
i fight for the unconventional
my right and its unconditional
i can only be as real as i can
the disadvantage is i never knew the plan
this isnt just a way to be a martyr
i cant walk alone any longer
i fight for the ones who cant fight
and if i lose at least i tried

chorus
we we are the new diabolic
we we are the bitter bucolic
if i have to give my life you can have it
we we are the pulse of the maggots

i wont be the inconsequential
i wont be the wasted potential
i can make it as severe as i can
until you realize youll never take a stand
it isnt just a onesided version
weve dealt with a manic subversion
i wont let the truth be perverted
and i wont leave another victim deserted

chorus
we we are the new diabolic
we we are the bitter bucolic
if i have to give my life you can have it
we we are the pulse of the maggots

verse 3
we fight till no one can fight us
we live and no one can stop us
we pull when were pushed too far
and the advantage is the bottom line is
we never had to fight in the first place
we only had to spit back in their face
we wont walk alone any longer
what doesnt kill us only makes us stronger

chorus
we we are the new diabolic
we we are the bitter bucolic
if i have to give my life you can have it
we we are the pulse of the maggots
