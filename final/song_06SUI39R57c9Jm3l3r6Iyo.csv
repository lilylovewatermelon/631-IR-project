women do get weary
wearing the same shabby dress
and when shes weary
try a little tenderness

uuh she may be waiting
just anticipating
things she may never possess
and while shes without them
try a little tenderness

its not just sentimental
she has her grief
and her care
but a word
so soft and gentle
makes it easier
to bear

you wont regret it
women dont forget it
love is their whole happiness
and its all so easy
try a little tenderness
you might also likebut a word
soft and gentle
makes it easier
to bear

you wont regret it
women dont forget it
love is their whole happiness
and its all so easy
just try a little tenderness
youve gotta try

youve gotta hold her
youve got to squeeze her
you have to try
youve got to try
and always please her

you wont regret it
you wont regret it
oh try a little tenderness1embed"
