my darling i have wronged you
down the devils path i have roamed
regret sadness and sorrow
now in my soul have found a home

chorus
my sweet caroline
from your loving arms ive strayed
in your heart may you find
forgiveness i pray
a fool to temptation
i surely played
i come to you now for salvation
have mercy in loves name
my sweet caroline
from your loving arms ive strayed
in your heart may you find
forgiveness i pray hey

verse 2
the chilling cry of sins wrath
sounds like thunder through my head
i find no rest now no comfort
in a cold dark lonely bed

from your loving arms ive strayed
in your heart may you find

a fool to temptation
i surely played
i come to you now for salvation
have mercy in loves name
my sweet caroline
from your loving arms ive strayed
in your heart may you find
forgiveness i pray haembed"
