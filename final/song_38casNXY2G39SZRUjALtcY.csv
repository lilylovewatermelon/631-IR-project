burn it all down wanna buy another round
gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
knee socks drink tequila on the rocks
til you make your body pops to the speaker
burn it all down wanna buy another round
gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
show your knee socks drink tequila on the rocks
til you make your body pops to the speaker
