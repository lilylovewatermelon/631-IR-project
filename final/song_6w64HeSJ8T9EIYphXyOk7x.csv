i could do without my old truck sittin out in my drive
i could find another town to love just as much as i love mine
i could do without that twelvegauge granddaddy gave me
i could do without a lotta things but baby

chorus
without you i dont know where id be
id be lost like a ship wrecked at sea
aint no doubt about it
everything about yas everything i need
without you there aint much left of me

verse 2
i dont wanna live to see the day i dont get to see your smile
i dont wanna wake up if i aint wakin up by your side
this house that we built girl it wouldnt be a home
id make it for a while but i wouldnt make it long

chorus
without you i dont where id be
id be lost like a ship wrecked at sea
aint no doubt about it
everything about yas everything i need
without you there aint much left of me
see dylan scott liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likebridge
i was lost before i found you
now my world spins around you
youre every move i make
youre every breath i take
i pray i never live a day without you

chorus
girl without you i dont where id be
id be lost like a ship wrecked at sea
aint no doubt about it
everything about yas everything i need
without you there aint much left of me
aint much left of meembed"
