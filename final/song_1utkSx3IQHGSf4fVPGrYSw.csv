and go insane
i watch you drive your stupid car
you go away
you never were one to use caution
and you dont obey
you know id love to see it happen

i always tried to keep you near me
without the pain
i love to tie us into knots
we slipped away
i tried to captivate you on that evening
he was leaving with the girl id love to kill

chorus
happy death day to you baby
i know youre flying in the blue now
well be together real soon now baby dont you worry
papas got a brand new body bag for you
cable cars run through my mind
reminiscent bay
i think id love a valentine
i wish youd stay
you never were one to use caution
it slipped away
i somehow knew this would happen

happy death day to you baby
i know youre flying in the blue now
well be together real soon now baby dont you worry
papas got a brand new body bag for you

and i got a fresh new kind of attitude

i slowly shoot these words like weapons
and go insane
i watch you drive your stupid car
you go away
you never were you never were
you know id love to see it happen

chorus x2
happy death day to you baby
i know youre flying in the blue now
well be together real soon now baby dont you worry
papas got a brand new body bag for you

papas got a brand new body bag for you
and daddys got a brand new body bag for you
and he aint ever ever coming back to youembed"
