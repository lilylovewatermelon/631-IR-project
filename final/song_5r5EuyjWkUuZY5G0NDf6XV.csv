here shes coming and shes drunk again
shes only seventeen
her daddy said well thats enough of that
come be my little queen
and now hes touching her wrong again
hes gonna give her disease
he never wanted it anyway
he only does as he please

chorus
wont you tell her that i said im the one
i couldnt hurt her like everyone
and tell her that i said im the one
and i dont deserve her

verse 2
here hes coming and hes drunk again
hes on amphetamines
scratch his nails down the other leg
cause youre my little queen
and now hes touching her wrong again
shes only trying to get by
he never wanted it anyway
he never soils the child
