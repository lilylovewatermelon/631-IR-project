when its four in the morning
when it comes without warning
the silence drags you down under the tide
when your whole world is jaded
when your colors are faded
and nothing but your shadows on your side

if you ever need somebody
even if all your tiles fall down
if you ever need somebody
even when all your hope runs out
if you ever need somebody
i believe i believe i believe in you in you
i believe i believe i believe in you in you

when your fights fly like arrows
when the way all feels narrow
and the rock you always lean on starts to slide
you feel suffocated
so once celebrated
and the person that you were you cannot find
