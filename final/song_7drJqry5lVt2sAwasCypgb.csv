the original ahhh
let them niggas know how you livin

verse 1
i split ya wig then shape it up
fill it wit good things i bring then tape it up
believe us its the beat batterer with the flow
breaking into instrumental mindstates so
another dollar another day
some brothas wanna play
others choose to parlay
either way its all good they say
so me i be loungin youthful like a fountain
the hardcore adore
bumpin out ya monitor
poppin a thermometer in the night fever
i keeps a bag of cheeba inside my pocket
so when i feel the urge to get nice then i spark it
word to god this so real to how im livin
no doubt they bout to catch a bad decision
you cant front cuz im on a head hunt
all year and all month wit the blood so whatchu want

chorus
the original baby pa yall

a sip of liquor and i become the mic gripper
wild like the oj simpson trial palnow figure
meanwhile i hold the vile style or the card
to chomp and bite till their heads feel like
i trapchop a kite to my man cuz we tight
and think about the things that they had brang in the night
dreams make me worry if my visions blurry
so if i feel it in my hood does that make me smart
you never know what kinda flavors in the mission
money sex or murder true facts im fixin
once the rhyme clickin then im lyric lickin
stickin and movin to the groove thats loopin
scoopin the honey dips come fine wit the juicy lips
jimmy hats for them contagious putie cats
it aint nothin but the dog like blackstreet
in the car in the bed or on the loveseat

chorus
the original baby pa yall
check it out
the original baby pa yall

verse 3
extreme satisfaction wit the mic
good fashion and overpass the trash
i  with a passion
there certain shit im not havin
its not a laughn matter
the sytle i kick is fatter
people rapper type be alerted
the clip is inserted and with accuracy g i squirt it
perfect timin 
flippin the script like that man in the shining
a natural force of habit sets off the magic
faggots that want staticll have to take drastic
measures it will be my pleasure to do you harm
exposive my motive effective like a charm
word is bond make no mistakes how im fadin fakes
the undercover jakes bones break when i demonstrate
not even too soon or too late
with the 95 style vibratin through the groundembed"
