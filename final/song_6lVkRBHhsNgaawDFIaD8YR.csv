is there anybody out there
that wakes up with a bitter taste
its a king that we put up there
and hes a short way to fall from grace
its slowly filling upward
you can stand but you have no ground
i hear it from the lost words
they say its time that you lost your crown

chorus
dont be so greedy
a dollars a penny to you
when hearts are beating
say what you want em to do
wasting away i see you
when the top of the world falls on you
finding a day dont wanna be you
when the top of the world falls on you

verse 2
is there anybody out there
that can see what a man can change
its better that you dont care
because he knows that hes in his stage
i feel the paranoia
when theres a time put you in your place
in the eyes of those who watch ya
well they can wait til you hit your face
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likechorus
dont be so greedy
a dollars a penny to you
when hearts are beating
say what you want em to do
wasting away i see you
when the top of the world falls on you
finally a day dont wanna be you
when the top of the world falls on you

bridge
paint yourself a picture
when you waste another picture
and you win and you win and you win
paint yourself a picture
and then you break another picture
and you win and you win and you win
and you win yeah you win and you win

chorus
dont be so greedy
a dollars a penny to you
when hearts stop beating
say what you want em to do
wasting away i see you
when the top of the world falls on you
finding a day dont wanna be you
when the top of the world falls on you
outro
wasting away i see you
when the top of the world falls on you
finding a day dont wanna be you
when the top of the world falls on youembed"
