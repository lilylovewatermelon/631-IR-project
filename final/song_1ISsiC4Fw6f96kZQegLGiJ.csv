verse 3
its easy to blame god but harder to fix things
we look in the sky like why aint you listening
watchin the news in our livin rooms on the big screens
and talkin about if gods really real then where is he is he is he…
you see the same god that were sayin might not even exist
becomes real to us but only when were dyin in bed
when youre healthy its like we dont really care for him then
leave me alone god ill call you when i need you again need you again
which is funny everyone will sleep in the pews
then blame god for our problems like hes sleepin on you
we turn our backs on him what do you expect him to do
its hard to answer prayers when nobodys prayin to you prayin to you
i look around at this world we walk on walk on
its a smack in the face dont ever tell me theres no god no god
and if there isnt then what are we here for
and what are yall doin down there i dont know lord ah

chorus
