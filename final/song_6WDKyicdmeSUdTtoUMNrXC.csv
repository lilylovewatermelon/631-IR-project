as the third of the peculiarities of the dreamcontent we have adduced the fact in agreement with all other writers on the subject excepting robert that impressions from our childhood may appear in dreams which do not seem to be at the disposal of the waking memory it is of course difficult to decide how seldom or how frequently this occurs because after waking the origin of the respective elements of the dream is not recognized the proof that we are dealing with impressions of our childhood must thus be adduced objectively and only in rare instances do the conditions favour such proof the story is told by a maury as being particularly conclusive of a man who decides to visit his birthplace after an absence of twenty years on the night before his departure he dreams that he is in a totally unfamiliar locality and that he there meets a strange man with whom he holds a conversation subsequently upon his return home he is able to convince himself that this strange locality really exists in the vicinity of his home and the strange man in the dream turns out to be a friend of his dead fathers who is living in the town this is of course a conclusive proof that in his childhood he had seen both the man and the locality the dream moreover is to be interpreted as a dream of impatience like the dream of the girl who carries in her pocket the ticket for a concert the dream of the child whose father had promised him an excursion to the hameau ch iii and so forth the motives which reproduce just these impressions of childhood for the dreamer cannot of course be discovered without analysis

one of my colleagues who attended my lectures and who boasted that his dreams were very rarely subject to distortion told me that he had sometime previously seen in a dream his former tutor in bed with his nurse who had remained in the household until his eleventh year the actual location of this scene was realized even in the dream as he was greatly interested he related the dream to his elder brother who laughingly confirmed its reality the brother said that he remembered the affair very distinctly for he was six years old at the time the lovers were in the habit of making him the elder boy drunk with beer whenever circumstances were favourable to their nocturnal intercourse the younger child our dreamer at that time three years of age slept in the same room as the nurse but was not regarded as an obstacle

in yet another case it may be definitely established without the aid of dreaminterpretation that the dream contains elements from childhood namely if the dream is a socalled perennial dream one which being first dreamt in childhood recurs again and again in adult years i may add a few examples of this sort to those already known although i have no personal knowledge of perennial dreams a physician in his thirties tells me that a yellow lion concerning which he is able to give the precisest information has often appeared in his dreamlife from his earliest childhood up to the present day this lion known to him from his dreams was one day discovered in natura as a longforgotten china animal the young man then learned from his mother that the lion had been his favourite toy in early childhood a fact which he himself could no longer remember

if we now turn from the manifest dreamcontent to the dreamthoughts which are revealed only on analysis the experiences of childhood may be found to recur even in dreams whose content would not have led us to suspect anything of the sort i owe a particularly delightful and instructive example of such a dream

to my esteemed colleague of the yellow lion after reading nansens account of his polar expedition he dreamt that he was giving the intrepid explorer electrical treatment on an icefloe for the sciatica of which the latter complained during the analysis of this dream he remembered an incident of his childhood without which the dream would be wholly unintelligible when he was three or four years of age he was one day listening attentively to the conversation of his elders they were talking of exploration and he presently asked his father whether exploration was a bad illness he had apparently confounded reisen journey trips with reissen gripes tearing pains and the derision of his brothers and sisters prevented his ever forgetting the humiliating experience

we have a precisely similar case when in the analysis of the dream of the monograph on the genus cyclamen i stumble upon a memory retained from childhood to the effect that when i was five years old my father allowed me to destroy a book embellished with coloured plates it will perhaps be doubted whether this recollection really entered into the composition of the dream content and it may be suggested that the connection was established subsequently by the analysis but the abundance and intricacy of the associative connections vouch for the truth of my explanation cyclamen favourite flower favourite dish artichoke to pick to pieces like an artichoke leaf by leaf a phrase which at that time one heard daily a propos of the dividing up of the chinese empire herbarium bookworm whose favourite food is books i can further assure the reader that the ultimate meaning of the dream which i have not given here is most intimately connected with the content of the scene of childish destruction

in another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the very wish which has given rise to the dream and whose fulfilment the dream proves to be has itself originated in childhood so that one is astonished to find that the child with all his impulses survives in the dream

i shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has already proved instructive i refer to the dream in which my friend r is my uncle we have carried its interpretation far enough for the wishmotive the wish to be appointed professor to assert itself palpably and we have explained the affection felt for my friend r in the dream as the outcome of opposition to and defiance of the two colleagues who appear in the dreamthoughts thee dream was my own i may therefore continue the analysis by stating that i did not feel quite satisfied with the solution arrived at i knew that my opinion of these colleagues who were so badly treated in my dreamthoughts would have been expressed in very different language in my waking life the intensity of the wish that i might not share their fate as regards the appointment seemed to me too slight fully to account for the discrepancy between my dream opinion and my waking opinion if the desire to be addressed by another title were really so intense it would be proof of a morbid ambition which i do not think i cherish and which i believe i was far from entertaining i do not know how others who think they know me would judge me perhaps i really was ambitious but if i was my ambition has long since been transferred to objects other than the rank and title of professor extraordinarius

whence then the ambition which the dream has ascribed to me here i am reminded of a story which i heard often in my childhood that at my birth an old peasant woman had prophesied to my happy mother whose firstborn i was that she had brought a great man into the world such prophecies must be made very

frequently there are so many happy and expectant mothers and so many old peasant women and other old women who since their mundane powers have deserted them turn their eyes toward the future and the prophetess is not likely to suffer for her prophecies is it possible that my thirst for greatness has originated from this source but here i recollect an impression from the later years of my childhood which might serve even better as an explanation one evening at a restaurant on the prater where my parents were accustomed to take me when i was eleven or twelve years of age we noticed a man who was going from table to table and for a small sum improvising verses upon any subject that was given him i was sent to bring the poet to our table and he showed his gratitude before asking for a subject he threw off a few rhymes about myself and told us that if he could trust his inspiration i should probably one day become a minister i can still distinctly remember the impression produced by this second prophecy it was in the days of the bourgeois ministry my father had recently brought home the portraits of the bourgeois university graduates herbst giskra unger berger and others and we illuminated the house in their honour there were even jews among them so that every diligent jewish schoolboy carried a ministerial portfolio in his satchel the impression of that time must be responsible for the fact that until shortly before i went to the university i wanted to study jurisprudence and changed my mind only at the last moment a medical man has no chance of becoming a minister and now for my dream it is only now that i begin to see that it translates me from the sombre present to the hopeful days of the bourgeois ministry and completely fulfils what was then my youthful ambition in treating my two estimable and learned colleagues merely because they are jews so badly one as though he were a simpleton and the other as though he were a criminal i am acting as though i were the minister i have put myself in his place what a revenge i take upon his excellency he refuses to appoint me professor extraordinarius and so in my dream i put myself in his place

in another case i note the fact that although the wish that excites the dream is a contemporary wish it is nevertheless greatly reinforced by memories of childhood i refer to a series of dreams which are based on the longing to go to rome for a long time to come i shall probably have to satisfy this longing by means of dreams since at the season of the year when i should be able to travel rome is to be avoided for reasons of health13 thus i once dreamt that i saw the tiber and the bridge of sant angelo from the window of a railway carriage presently the train started and i realized that i had never entered the city at all the view that appeared in the dream was modelled after a wellknown engraving which i had casually noticed the day before in the drawingroom of one of my patients in another dream someone took me up a hill and showed me rome half shrouded in mist and so distant that i was astonished at the distinctness of the view the content of this dream is too rich to be fully reported here the motive to see the promised land afar is here easily recognizable the city which i thus saw in the mist is lubeck the original of the hill is the gleichenberg in a third dream i am at last in rome to my disappointment the scenery is anything but urban it consists of a little stream of black water on one side of which are black rocks while on the other are meadows with large white flowers i notice a certain herr zucker with whom i am superficially acquainted and resolve to ask him to show me the way into the city it is obvious that i am trying in vain to see in my dream a city which i have never seen in my waking life if i resolve the landscape into its elements the white flowers point to ravenna which is known to me and which once for a time replaced rome as the capital of italy in the marshes around ravenna we had found the most beautiful waterlilies in the midst of black pools of water the dream makes them grow in the meadows like the narcissi of our own aussee because we found it so troublesome to cull them from the water the black rock so close to the water vividly recalls the valley of the tepl at karlsbad karlsbad now enables me to account for the peculiar circumstance that i ask herr zucker to show me the way in the material of which the dream is woven i am able to recognize two of those amusing jewish anecdotes which conceal such profound and at times such bitter worldly wisdom and which we are so fond of quoting in our letters and conversation one is the story of the constitution it tells how a poor jew sneaks into the karlsbad express without a ticket how he is detected and is treated more and more harshly by the conductor at each succeeding call for tickets and how when a friend whom he meets at one of the stations during his miserable journey asks him where he is going he answers to karlsbad if my constitution holds out associated in memory with this is another story about a jew who is ignorant of french and who has express instructions to ask in paris for the rue richelieu paris was for many years the goal of my own longing and i regarded the satisfaction with which i first set foot on the pavements of paris as a warrant that i should attain to the fulfilment of other wishes also moreover asking the way is a direct allusion to rome for as we know all roads lead to rome and further the name zucker sugar again points to karlsbad whither we send persons afflicted with the constitutional disease diabetes zuckerkrankheit sugardisease the occasion for this dream was the proposal of my berlin friend that we should meet in prague at easter a further association with sugar and diabetes might be found in the matters which i had to discuss with him 

a fourth dream occurring shortly after the lastmentioned brings me back to rome i see a street corner before me and am astonished that so many german placards should be posted there on the previous day when writing to my friend i had told him with truly prophetic vision that prague would probably not be a comfortable place for german travellers the dream therefore expressed simultaneously the wish to meet him in rome instead of in the bohemian capital and the desire which probably originated during my student days that the german language might be accorded more tolerance in prague as a matter of fact i must have understood the czech language in the first years of my childhood for i was born in a small village in moravia amidst a slay population a czech nursery rhyme which i heard in my seventeenth year became without effort on my part so imprinted upon my memory that i can repeat it to this day although i have no idea of its meaning thus in these dreams also there is no lack of manifold relations to the impressions of my early childhood
during my last italian journey which took me past lake trasimenus i at length discovered after i had seen the tiber and had reluctantly turned back some fifty miles from rome what a reinforcement my longing for the eternal city had received from the impressions of my childhood i had just conceived a plan of travelling to naples via rome the following year when this sentence which i must have read in one of our german classics occurred to me14 it is a question which of the two paced to and fro in his room the more impatiently after he had conceived the plan of going to rome assistant headmaster winckelmann or the great general hannibal i myself had walked in hannibals footsteps like him i was destined never to see rome and he too had gone to campania when all were expecting him in rome hannibal with whom i had achieved this point of similarity had been my favourite hero during my years at the gymnasium like so many boys of my age i bestowed my sympathies in the punic war not on the romans but on the carthaginians moreover when i finally came to realize the consequences of belonging to an alien race and was forced by the antisemitic feeling among my classmates to take a definite stand the figure of the semitic commander assumed still greater proportions in my imagination hannibal and rome symbolized in my youthful eyes the struggle between the tenacity of the jews and the organization of the catholic church the significance for our emotional life which the antisemitic movement has since assumed helped to fix the thoughts and impressions of those earlier days thus the desire to go to rome has in my dream life become the mask and symbol for a number of warmly cherished wishes for whose realization one had to work with the tenacity and singlemindedness of the punic general though their fulfilment at times seemed as remote as hannibals lifelong wish to enter rome 

and now for the first time i happened upon the youthful experience which even today still expresses its power in all these emotions and dreams i might have been ten or twelve years old when my father began to take me with him on his walks and in his conversation to reveal his views on the things of this world thus it was that he once told me the following incident in order to show me that i had been born into happier times than he when i was a young man i was walking one saturday along the street in the village where you were born i was welldressed with a new fur cap on my head up comes a christian who knocks my cap into the mud and shouts jew get off the pavement and what did you do i went into the street and picked up the cap he calmly replied that did not seem heroic on the part of the big strong man who was leading me a little fellow by the hand i contrasted this situation which did not please me with another more in harmony with my sentiments the scene in which hannibals father hamilcar barcas made his son swear before the household altar to take vengeance on the romans15 ever since then hannibal has had a place in my phantasies 

i think i can trace my enthusiasm for the carthaginian general still further back into my childhood so that it is probably only an instance of an already established emotional relation being transferred to a new vehicle one of the first books which fell into my childish hands after i learned to read was thiers consulate and empire i remember that i pasted on the flat backs of my wooden soldiers little labels bearing the names of the imperial marshals and that at that time massena as a jew menasse was already my avowed favourite16 this preference is doubtless also to be explained by the fact of my having been born a hundred years later on the same date napoleon himself is associated with hannibal through the crossing of the alps and perhaps the development of this martial ideal may be traced yet farther back to the first three years of my childhood to wishes which my alternately friendly and hostile relations with a boy a year older than myself must have evoked in the weaker of the two playmates 

the deeper we go into the analysis of dreams the more often are we put on the track of childish experiences which play the part of dreamsources in the latent dreamcontent

we have learned that dreams very rarely reproduce memories in such a manner as to constitute unchanged and unabridged the sole manifest dreamcontent nevertheless a few authentic examples which show such reproduction have been recorded and i can add a few new ones which once more refer to scenes of childhood in the case of one of my patients a dream once gave a barely distorted reproduction of a sexual incident which was immediately recognized as an accurate recollection the memory of it had never been completely lost in the waking life but it had been greatly obscured and it was revivified by the previous work of analysis the dreamer had at the age of twelve visited a bedridden schoolmate who had exposed himself probably only by a chance movement in bed at the sight of the boys genitals he was seized by a kind of compulsion exposed himself and took hold of the member of the other boy who however looked at him in surprise and indignation whereupon he became embarrassed and let it go a dream repeated this scene twentythree years later with all the details of the accompanying emotions changing it however in this respect that the dreamer played the passive instead of the active role while the person of the schoolmate was replaced by a contemporary

as a rule of course a scene from childhood is represented in the manifest dreamcontent only by an allusion and must be disentangled from the dream by interpretation the citation of examples of this kind cannot be very convincing because any guarantee that they are really experiences of childhood is lacking if they belong to an earlier period of life they are no longer recognized by our memory the conclusion that such childish experiences recur at all in dreams is justified in psychoanalytic work by a great number of factors which in their combined results appear to be sufficiently reliable but when for the purposes of dreaminterpretation such references to childish experiences are torn out of their context they may not perhaps seem very impressive especially where i do not even give all the material upon which the interpretation is based however i shall not let this deter me from giving a few examples 

i
with one of my female patients all dreams have the character of hurry she is hurrying so as to be in time so as not to miss her train and so on in one dream she has to visit a girl friend her mother had told her to ride and not walk she runs however and keeps on calling the material that emerged in the analysis allowed one to recognize a memory of childish romping and especially for one dream went back to the popular childish game of rapidly repeating the words of a sentence as though it was all one word all these harmless jokes with little friends were remembered because they replaced other less harmless ones17 

ii
the following dream was dreamed by another female patient she is in a large room in which there are all sorts of machines it is rather like what she would imagine an orthopaedic institute to be she hears that i am pressed for time and that she must undergo treatment along with five others but she resists and is unwilling to lie down on the bed or whatever it is which is intended for her she stands in a corner and waits for me to say it is not true the others meanwhile laugh at her saying it is all foolishness on her part at the same time it is as though she were called upon to make a number of little squares

the first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to the treatment and to the transference to myself the second contains an allusion to a scene of childhood the two portions are connected by the mention of the bed the orthopaedic institute is an allusion to one of my talks in which i compared the treatment with regard to its duration and its nature to an orthopaedic treatment at the beginning of the treatment i had to tell her that for the present i had little time to give her but that later on i would devote a whole hour to her daily this aroused in her the old sensitiveness which is a leading characteristic of children who are destined to become hysterical their desire for love is insatiable my patient was the youngest of six brothers and sisters hence with five others and as such her fathers favourite but in spite of this she seems to have felt that her beloved father devoted far too little time and attention to her her waiting for me to say it is not trite was derived as follows a little tailors apprentice had brought her a dress and she had given him the money for it then she asked her husband whether she would have to pay the money again if the boy were to lose it to tease her her husband answered yes the teasing in the dream and she asked again and again and waited for him to say it is not true the thought of the latent dream content may now be construed as follows will she have to pay me double the amount when i devote twice as much time to her a thought which is stingy or filthy the uncleanliness of childhood is often replaced in dreams by greed for money the word filthy here supplies the bridge if all the passage referring to her waiting until i say it is not true is intended in the dream as a circumlocution for the word dirty the standinginthecorner and not lyingdownonthebed are in keeping with this word as component parts of a scene of her childhood in which she had soiled her bed in punishment for which she was put into the corner with a warning that papa would not love her any more whereupon her brothers and sisters laughed at her etc the little squares refer to her young niece who showed her the arithmetical trick of writing figures in nine squares i think in such a way that on being added together in any direction they make fifteen

here is a mans dream he sees two boys tussling with each other they are coopers boys as he concludes from the tools which are lying about one of the boys has thrown the other down the prostrate boy is wearing earrings with blue stones he runs towards the assailant with lifted cane in order to chastise him the boy takes refuge behind a woman as though she were his mother who is standing against a wooden fence she is the wife of a daylabourer and she turns her back to the man who is dreaming finally she turns about and stares at him with a horrible look so that he runs away in terror the red flesh of the lower lid seems to stand out from her eyes

this dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences from the previous day in the course of which he actually saw two boys in the street one of whom threw the other down when he walked up to them in order to settle the quarrel both of them took to their heels coopers boys this is explained only by a

subsequent dream in the analysis of which he used the proverbial expression to knock the bottom out of the barrel earrings with blue stones according to his observation are worn chiefly by prostitutes this suggests a familiar doggerel rhyme about two boys the other boy was called marie that is he was a girl the woman standing by the fence after the scene with the two boys he went for a walk along the bank of the danube and taking advantage of being alone urinated against a wooden fence a little farther on a respectably dressed elderly lady smiled at him very pleasantly and wanted to hand him her card with her address
since in the dream the woman stood as he had stood while urinating there is an allusion to a woman urinating and this explains the horrible look and the prominence of the red flesh which can only refer to the genitals gaping in a squatting posture seen in childhood they had appeared in later recollection as proud flesh as a wound the dream unites two occasions upon which as a little boy the dreamer was enabled to see the genitals of little girls once by throwing the little girl down and once while the child was urinating and as is shown by another association he had retained in his memory the punishment administered or threatened by his father on account of these manifestations of sexual curiosity 

iv
a great mass of childish memories which have been hastily combined into a phantasy may be found behind the following dream of an elderly lady she goes out in a hurry to do some shopping on the graben she sinks to her knees as though she had broken down a number of people collect around her especially cabdrivers but no one helps her to get up she makes many vain attempts finally she must have succeeded for she is put into a cab which is to take her home a large heavily laden basket something like a market basket is thrown after her through the window

this is the woman who is always harassed in her dreams just as she used to be harassed when a child the first situation of the dream is apparently taken from the sight of a fallen horse just as broken down points to horseracing in her youth she was a rider still earlier she was probably also a horse with the idea of falling down is connected her first childish reminiscence of the seventeenyearold son of the hall porter who had an epileptic seizure in the street and was brought home in a cab of this of course she had only heard but the idea of epileptic fits of falling down acquired a great influence over her phantasies and later on influenced the form of her own hysterical attacks when a person of the female sex dreams of falling this almost always has a sexual significance she becomes a fallen woman and for the purpose of the dream under consideration this interpretation is probably the least doubtful for she falls in the graben the street in vienna which is known as the concourse of prostitutes the marketbasket admits of more than one interpretation in the sense of refusal german korb  basket  snub refusal it reminds her of the many snubs which she at first administered to her suitors and which she thinks she herself received later this agrees with the detail no one will help her up which she herself interprets as being disdained further the marketbasket recalls phantasies which have already appeared in the course of analysis in which she imagines that she has married far beneath her station and now goes to the market as a marketwoman lastly the market basket might be interpreted as the mark of a servant this suggests further memories of her childhood of a cook who was discharged because she stole she too sank to her knees and begged for mercy the dreamer was at that time twelve years of age then emerges a recollection of a chambermaid who was dismissed because she had an affair with the coachman of the household who incidentally married her afterwards this recollection therefore gives us a clue to the cabdrivers in the dream who in opposition to the reality do not stand by the fallen woman but there still remains to be explained the throwing of the basket in particular why it is thrown through the window this reminds her of the forwarding of luggage by rail to the custom of fensterln18 in the country and to trivial impressions of a summer resort of a gentleman who threw some blue plums into the window of a ladys room and of her little sister who was frightened because an idiot who was passing looked in at the window and now from behind all this emerges an obscure recollection from her tenth year of a nurse in the country to whom one of the menservants made love and whose conduct the child may have noticed and who was sent packing thrown out together with her lover in the dream we have the expression thrown into an incident which we have been approaching by several other paths the luggage or box of a servant is disparagingly described in vienna as seven plums pack up your seven plums and get out 

my collection of course contains a plethora of such patients dreams the analysis of which leads back to impressions of childhood often dating back to the first three years of life which are remembered obscurely or not at all but it is a questionable proceeding to draw conclusions from these and apply them to dreams in general for they are mostly dreams of neurotic and especially hysterical persons and the part played in these dreams by childish scenes might be conditioned by the nature of the neurosis and not by the nature of dreams in general in the interpretation of my own dreams however which is assuredly not undertaken on account of grave symptoms of illness it happens just as frequently that in the latent dreamcontent i am unexpectedly confronted with a scene of my childhood and that a whole series of my dreams will suddenly converge upon the paths proceeding from a single childish experience i have already given examples of this and i shall give yet more in different connections perhaps i cannot close this chapter more fittingly than by citing several dreams of my own in which recent events and longforgotten experiences of my childhood appear together as dreamsources

i
after i have been travelling and have gone to bed hungry and tired the prime necessities of life begin to assert their claims in sleep and i dream as follows i go into a kitchen in order to ask for some pudding there three women are standing one of whom is the hostess she is rolling something in her hands as though she were making dumplings she replies that i must wait until she has finished not distinctly as a speech i become impatient and go away affronted i want to put on an overcoat but the first i try on is too long i take it off and am somewhat astonished to find that it is trimmed with fur a second coat has a long strip of cloth with a turkish design sewn into it a stranger with a long face and a short pointed beard comes up and

prevents me from putting it on declaring that it belongs to him i now show him that it is covered all over with turkish embroideries he asks how do the turkish drawings strips of cloth concern you but we soon become quite friendly

in the analysis of this dream i remember quite unexpectedly the first novel which i ever read or rather which i began to read from the end of the first volume when i was perhaps thirteen years of age i have never learned the name of the novel or that of its author but the end remains vividly in my memory the hero becomes insane and continually calls out the names of the three women who have brought the greatest happiness and the greatest misfortune into his life pelagie is one of these names i still do not know what to make of this recollection during the analysis together with the three women there now emerge the three parcae who spin the fates of men and i know that one of the three women the hostess in the dream is the mother who gives life and who moreover as in my own case gives the child its first nourishment love and hunger meet at the mothers breast a young man so runs an anecdote who became a great admirer of womanly beauty once observed when the conversation turned upon the handsome wetnurse who had suckled him as a child that he was sorry that he had not taken better advantage of his opportunities i am in the habit of using the anecdote to elucidate the factor of retrospective tendencies in the mechanism of the psychoneuroses one of the parcae then is rubbing the palms of her hands together as though she were making dumplings a strange occupation for one of the fates and urgently in need of explanation this explanation is furnished by another and earlier memory of my childhood when i was six years old and receiving my first lessons from my mother i was expected to believe that we are made of dust and must therefore return to dust but this did not please me and i questioned the doctrine thereupon my mother rubbed the palms of her hands togetherjust as in making dumplings except that there was no dough between them and showed me the blackish scales of epidermis which were thus rubbed off as a proof that it is of dust that we are made great was my astonishment at this demonstration ad oculos and i acquiesced in the idea which i was later to hear expressed in the words thou owest nature a death19 thus the women to whom i go in the kitchen as i so often did in my childhood when i was hungry and my mother sitting by the fire admonished me to wait until lunch was ready are really the parcae and now for the dumplings at least one of my teachers at the university the very one to whom i am indebted for my histological knowledge epidermis would be reminded by the name knodl knodl means dumpling of a person whom he had to prosecute for plagiarizing his writings committing a plagiarism taking anything one can lay hands on even though it belongs to another obviously leads to the second part of the dream in which i am treated like the overcoat thief who for some time plied his trade in the lecture halls i have written the word plagiarism without definite intention because it occurred to me and now i see that it must belong to the latent dreamcontent and that it will serve as a bridge between the different parts of the manifest dreamcontent the chain of associations pelagie plagiarism plagiostomi20 sharks fishbladder connects the old novel with the affair of knodl and the overcoats german uberzieher  pullover overcoat or condom which obviously refer to an appliance appertaining to the technique of sex this it is true is a very forced and irrational connection but it is nevertheless one which i could not have established in waking life if it had not already been established by the dreamwork indeed as though nothing were sacred to this impulse to enforce associations the beloved name brucke bridge of words see above now serves to remind me of the very institute in which i spent my happiest hours as a student wanting for nothing so will you at the breasts of wisdom every day more pleasure find in the most complete contrast to the desires which plague me german plagen while i dream and finally there emerges the recollection of another dear teacher whose name once more sounds like something edible fleischl fleisch  meat like knodl  dumplings and of a pathetic scene in which the scales of epidermis play a part mother hostess and mental derangement the novel and a remedy from the latin pharmacopeia kuche  kitchen which numbs the sensation of hunger namely cocaine

in this manner i could follow the intricate trains of thought still farther and could fully elucidate that part of the dream which is lacking in the analysis but i must refrain because the personal sacrifice which this would involve is too great i shall take up only one of the threads which will serve to lead us directly to one of the dreamthoughts that lie at the bottom of the medley the stranger with the long face and pointed beard who wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat has the features of a tradesman of spalato of whom my wife bought a great deal of turkish cloth his name was popovic a suspicious name which even gave the humorist stettenheim a pretext for a suggestive remark he told me his name and blushingly shook my hand21 for the rest i find the same misuse of names as above in the case of pelagie knodl brucke fleischl no one will deny that such playing with names is a childish trick if i indulge in it the practice amounts to an act of retribution for my own name has often enough been the subject of such feeble attempts at wit goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is in respect to his name which he feels that he fills even as he fills his skin herder having written the following lines on his name

der du von gottern abstammst von gothen oder vom kote

so seid ihr gotterbilder auch zu staub 

thou who art born of the gods of the goths or of the mud thus are thy godlike images even dust 

i realize that this digression on the misuse of names was intended merely to justify this complaint but here let us stop the purchase at spalato reminds me of another purchase at cattaro where i was too cautious and missed the opportunity of making an excellent bargain missing an opportunity at the breast of the wet nurse see above one of the dreamthoughts occasioned by the sensation of hunger really amounts to this we should let nothing escape we should take what we can get even if we do a little wrong we should never let an opportunity go by life is so short and death inevitable because this is meant even sexually and because desire is unwilling to check itself before the thought of doing wrong this philosophy of carpe diem has reason to fear the censorship and must conceal itself behind a dream and so all sorts of counterthoughts find expression with recollections of the time when spiritual nourishment alone was sufficient for the dreamer with hindrances of every kind and even threats of disgusting sexual punishments

a second dream requires a longer preliminary statement

i had driven to the western station in order to start on a holiday trip to the aussee but i went on to the platform in time for the ischl train which leaves earlier there i saw count thun who was again going to see the emperor at ischl in spite of the rain he arrived in an open carriage came straight through the entrance gate for the local trains and with a curt gesture and not a word of explanation he waved back the gatekeeper who did not know him and wanted to take his ticket after he had left in the ischl train i was asked to leave the platform and return to the waiting room but after some difficulty i obtained permission to remain i passed the time noting how many people bribed the officials to secure a compartment i fully intended to make a complaint that is to demand the same privilege meanwhile i sang something to myself which i afterwards recognized as the aria from the marriage of figaro 

if my lord count would tread a measure tread a measure let him but say his pleasure

and i will play the tune 

possibly another person would not have recognized the tune the whole evening i was in a highspirited pugnacious mood i chaffed the waiter and the cabdriver i hope without hurting their feelings and now all kinds of bold and revolutionary thoughts came into my mind such as would fit themselves to the words of figaro and to memories of beaumarchais comedy of which i had seen a performance at the comedie francaise the speech about the great men who have taken the trouble to be born the seigneurial right which count almaviva wishes to exercise with regard to susanne the jokes which our malicious opposition journalists make on the name of count thun german thun  do calling him graf nichtsthun countdonothing i really do not envy him he now has a difficult audience with the emperor before him and it is i who am the real countdonothing for i am going off for a holiday i make all sorts of amusing plans for the vacation now a gentleman arrives whom i know as a government representative at the medical examinations and who has won the flattering nickname of the governmental bedfellow literally bysleeper by his activities in this capacity by insisting on his official status he secured half a firstclass compartment and i heard one guard say to another where are we going to put the gentleman with the firstclass halfcompartment a pretty sort of favouritism i am paying for a whole firstclass compartment i did actually get a whole compartment to myself but not in a through carriage so there was no lavatory at my disposal during the night my complaints to the guard were fruitless i revenged myself by suggesting that at least a hole be made in the floor of this compartment to serve the possible needs of passengers at a quarter to three in the morning i wake with an urgent desire to urinate from the following dream

a crowd a students meeting a certain count thun or taaffe is making a speech being asked to say something about the germans he declares with a contemptuous gesture that their favourite flower is coltsfoot and he then puts into his buttonhole something like a torn leaf really the crumpled skeleton of a leaf i jump up and i jump up22 but i am surprised at my implied attitude then more indistinctly it seems as though this were the vestibule aula the exits are thronged and one must escape i make my way through a suite of handsomely appointed rooms evidently ministerial apartments with furniture of a colour between brown and violet and at last i come to a corridor in which a housekeeper a fat elderly woman is seated i try to avoid speaking to her but she apparently thinks i have a right to pass this way because she asks whether she shall accompany me with the lamp i indicate with a gesture or tell her that she is to remain standing on the stairs and it seems to me that i am very clever for after all i am evading detection now i am downstairs and i find a narrow steeply rising path which i follow 

again indistinctly it is as though my second task were to get away from the city just as my first was to get out of the building i am riding in a onehorse cab and i tell the driver to take me to a railway station i cant drive with you on the railway line itself i say when he reproaches me as though i had tired him out here it seems as though i had already made a journey in his cab which is usually made by rail the stations are crowded i am wondering whether to go to krems or to znaim but i reflect that the court will be there and i decide in favour of graz or some such place now i am seated in the railway carriage which is rather like a tram and i have in my buttonhole a peculiar long braided thing on which are violetbrown violets of stiff material which makes a great impression on people here the scene breaks off

i am once more in front of the railway station but i am in the company of an elderly gentleman i think out a scheme for remaining unrecognized but i see this plan already being carried out thinking and experiencing are here as it were the same thing he pretends to be blind at least in one eye and i hold before him a male glass urinal which we have to buy in the city or have bought i am thus a sicknurse and have to give him the urinal because he is blind if the conductor sees us in this position he must pass us by without drawing attention to us at the same time the position of the elderly man and his urinating organ is plastically perceived then i wake with a desire to urinate

the whole dream seems a sort of phantasy which takes the dreamer back to the year of revolution 1848 the memory of which had been revived by the jubilee of 1898 as well as by a little excursion to wachau on which i visited emmersdorf the refuge of the student leader fischof23 to whom several features of the manifest dream content might refer the association of ideas then leads me to england to the house of my brother who used in jest to twit his wife with the title of tennysons poem fifty years ago whereupon the children were used to correct him fifteen years ago this phantasy however which attaches itself to the thoughts evoked by the sight of count thun is like the facade of an italian church without organic connection with the structure behind it but unlike such a facade it is full of gaps and confused and in many places portions of the interior break through the first situation of the dream is made up of a number of scenes into which i am able to dissect it the arrogant attitude of the count in the dream is copied from a scene at my school which occurred in my fifteenth year we had hatched a conspiracy against an unpopular and ignorant teacher the leading spirit in this conspiracy was a schoolmate who since that time seems to have taken henry viii of england as his model it fell to me to carry out the coup detat and a discussion of the importance of the danube german donau to austria wachau was the occasion of an open revolt one of our fellowconspirators was our only aristocratic schoolmate he was called the giraffe on account of his conspicuous height and while he was being reprimanded by the tyrant of the school the professor of the german language he stood just as the count stood in the dream the explanation of the favourite flower and the putting into a buttonhole of something that must have been a flower which recalls the orchids which i had given that day to a friend and also a rose of jericho prominently recalls the incident in shakespeares historical play which opens the civil wars of the red and the white roses the mention of henry viii has paved the way to this reminiscence now it is not very far from roses to red and white carnations meanwhile two little rhymes the one german the other spanish insinuate themselves into the analysis rosen tulpen nelken alle blumen welken24 and isabelita no llores que se marchitan las flores25 the spanish line occurs in figaro here in vienna white carnations have become the badge of the antisemites red ones of the social democrats behind this is the recollection of an antisemitic challenge during a railway journey in beautiful saxony anglo saxon the third scene contributing to the formation of the first situation in the dream dates from my early student days there was a debate in a german students club about the relation of philosophy to the general sciences being a green youth full of materialistic doctrines i thrust myself forward in order to defend an extremely onesided position thereupon a sagacious older fellow student who has since then shown his capacity for leading men and organizing the masses and who moreover bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom rose and gave us a thorough dressingdown he too he said had herded swine in his youth and had then returned repentant to his fathers house i jumped up as in the dream became piggishly rude and retorted that since i knew he had herded swine i was not surprised at the tone of his discourse in the dream i am surprised at my german nationalistic feelings there was a great commotion and an almost general demand that i should retract my words but i stood my ground the insulted student was too sensible to take the advice which was offered him that he should send me a challenge and let the matter drop 

the remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more remote origin what does it mean that the count should make a scornful reference to coltsfoot here i must question my train of associations coltsfoot german huflattich lattice lettuce salathund the dog that grudges others what he cannot eat himself here plenty of opprobrious epithets may be discerned giraffe german affe  monkey ape pig sow dog i might even arrive by way of the name at donkey and thereby pour contempt upon an academic professor furthermore i translate coltsfoot huflattich i do not know whether i do so correctly by pisseenlit i get this idea from zolas germinal in which some children are told to bring some dandelion salad with them the dog chien has a name sounding not unlike the verb for the major function chier as pisser stands for the minor one now we shall soon have the indecent in all its three physical categories for in the same germinal which deals with the future revolution there is a description of a very peculiar contest which relates to the production of the gaseous excretions known as flatus26 and now i cannot but observe how the way to this flatus has been prepared a long while since beginning with the flowers and proceeding to the spanish rhyme of isabelita to ferdinand and isabella and by way of henry viii to english history at the time of the armada after the victorious termination of which the english struck a medal with the inscription flavit et dissipati sunt for the storm had scattered the spanish fleet 27 i had thought of using this phrase half jestingly as the title of a chapter on therapy if i should ever succeed in giving a detailed account of my conception and treatment of hysteria 

i cannot give so detailed an interpretation of the second scene of the dream out of sheer regard for the censorship for at this point i put myself in the place of a certain eminent gentleman of the revolutionary period who had an adventure with an eagle german adler and who is said to have suffered from incontinence of the bowels incontinentia and etc and here i believe that i should not be justified in passing the censorship even though it was an aulic councillor aula consiliarizis aulicus who told me the greater part of this history the suite of rooms in the dream is suggested by his excellencys private saloon carriage into which i was able to glance but it means as it so often does in dreams a woman28 the personality of the housekeeper is an ungrateful allusion to a witty old lady which ill repays her for the good times and the many good stories which i have enjoyed in her house the incident of the lamp goes back to grillparzer who notes a charming experience of a similar nature of which he afterwards made use in hero and leander the waves of the sea and of love the armada and the storm 

i must forego a detailed analysis of the two remaining portions of the dream i shall single out only those elements which lead me back to the two scenes of my childhood for the sake of which alone i have selected the dream the reader will rightly assume that it is sexual material which necessitates the suppression but he may not be content with this explanation there are many things of which one makes no secret to oneself but which must be treated as secrets in addressing others and here we are concerned not with the reasons which induce me to conceal the solution but with the motive of the inner censorship which conceals the real content of the dream even from myself concerning this i will confess that the analysis reveals these three portions of the dream as impertinent boasting the exuberance of an absurd megalomania long ago suppressed in my waking life which however dares to show itself with individual ramifications even in the manifest dream content it seems to me that i am a cunning fellow making the highspirited mood of the evening before the dream perfectly intelligible

boasting of every kind indeed thus the mention of graz points to the phrase what price graz which one is wont to use when one feels unusually wealthy readers who recall master rabelaiss inimitable description of the life and deeds of gargantua and his son pantagruel will be able to enroll even the suggested content of the first portion of the dream among the boasts to which i have alluded but the following belongs to the two scenes of childhood of which i have spoken i had bought a new trunk for this journey the colour of which a brownish violet appears in the dream several times violetbrown violets of a stiff cloth on an object which is known as a girlcatcher the furniture in the ministerial chambers children we know believe that one attracts peoples attention with anything new now i have been told of the following incident of my childhood my recollection of the occurrence itself has been replaced by my recollection of the story i am told that at the age of two i still used occasionally to wet my bed and that when i was reproved for doing so i consoled my father by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in n the nearest large town hence the interpolation in the dream that we had bought the urinal in the city or had to buy it one must keep ones promises one should note moreover the association of the male urinal and the womans trunk box all the megalomania of the child is contained in this promise the significance of dreams of urinary difficulties in the case of children has already been considered in the interpretation of an earlier dream cf the dream in chapter v a the psychoanalysis of neurotics has taught us to recognize the intimate connection between wetting the bed and the character trait of ambition

then when i was seven or eight years of age another domestic incident occurred which i remember very well one evening before going to bed i had disregarded the dictates of discretion and had satisfied my needs in my parents bedroom and in their presence reprimanding me for this delinquency my father remarked that boy will never amount to anything this must have been a terrible affront to my ambition for allusions to this scene recur again and again in my dreams and are constantly coupled with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes as though i wanted to say you see i have amounted to something after all this childish scene furnishes the elements for the last image of the dream in which the roles are interchanged of course for the purpose of revenge the elderly man obviously my father for the blindness in one eye signifies his onesided glaucoma29 is now urinating before me as i once urinated before him by means of the glaucoma i remind my father of cocaine which stood him in good stead during his operation as though i had thereby fulfilled my promise besides i make sport of him since he is blind i must hold the glass in front of him and i delight in allusions to my knowledge of the theory of hysteria of which i am proud30

if the two childish scenes of urination are according to my theory closely associated with the desire for greatness their resuscitation on the journey to the aussee was further favoured by the accidental circumstance that my compartment had no lavatory and that i must be prepared to postpone relief during the journey as actually happened in the morning when i woke with the sensation of a bodily need i suppose one might be inclined to credit this sensation with being the actual stimulus of the dream i should however prefer a different explanation namely that the dream thoughts first gave rise to the desire to urinate it is quite unusual for me to be disturbed in sleep by any physical need least of all at the time when i woke on this occasion a quarter to four in the morning i would forestall a further objection by remarking that i have hardly ever felt a desire to urinate after waking early on other journeys made under more comfortable circumstances however i can leave this point undecided without weakening my argument

further since experience in dreamanalysis has drawn my attention to the fact that even from dreams the interpretation of which seems at first sight complete because the dreamsources and the wish stimuli are easily demonstrable important trains of thought proceed which reach back into the earliest years of childhood i had to ask myself whether this characteristic does not even constitute an essential condition of dreaming if it were permissible to generalize this notion i should say that every dream is connected through its manifest content with recent experiences while through its latent content it is connected with the most remote experiences and i can actually show in the analysis of hysteria that these remote experiences have in a very real sense remained recent right up to the present but i still find it very difficult to prove this conjecture i shall have to return to the probable role in dreamformation of the earliest experiences of our childhood in another connection chapter vii

of the three peculiarities of the dreammemory considered above one the preference for the unimportant in the dreamcontent has been satisfactorily explained by tracing it back to dream distortion we have succeeded in establishing the existence of the other two peculiarities the preferential selection of recent and also of infantile material but we have found it impossible to derive them from the motives of the dream let us keep in mind these two characteristics which we still have to explain or evaluate a place will have to be found for them elsewhere either in the discussion of the psychology of the sleeping state or in the consideration of the structure of the psychic apparatus which we shall undertake later after we have seen that by means of dreaminterpretation we are able to glance as through an inspection hole into the interior of this apparatus

but here and now i will emphasize another result of the last few dreamanalyses the dream often appears to have several meanings not only may several wishfulfilments be combined in it as our examples show but one meaning or one wishfulfilment may conceal another until in the lowest stratum one comes upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period of childhood and here again it may be questioned whether the word often at the beginning of this sentence may not more correctly be replaced by constantly31

13 i long ago learned that the fulfilment of such wishes only called for a little courage and i then became a zealous pilgrim to rome 

14 the writer in whose works i found this passage was probably jean paul richter 

15 in the first edition of this book i gave here the name hasdrubal an amazing error which i explained in my psycho pathology of everyday life 

16 the jewish descent of the marshal is somewhat doubtful 

17 in the original this paragraph contains many plays on the word hetz hurry chase scurry game etc tr 

18 fensterln is the custom now falling into disuse found in rural districts of the german schwarzwald of lovers who woo their sweethearts at their bedroom windows to which they ascend by means of a ladder enjoying such intimacy that the relation practically amounts to a trial marriage the reputation of the young woman never suffers on account of fensterln unless she becomes intimate with too many suitors tr 

19 both the affects pertaining to these childish scenes astonishment and resignation to the inevitable appeared in a dream of slightly earlier date which first reminded me of this incident of my childhood

20 i do not bring in the plagiostomi arbitrarily they recall a painful incident of disgrace before the same teacher

21 popo  backside in german nursery language 

22 this repetition has crept into the text of the dream apparently through absentmindedness and i have left it because analysis shows that it has a meaning 

23 this is an error and not a slip for i learned later that the emmersdorf in wachau is not identical with the refuge of the revolutionist fischof a place of the same name

24 roses tulips and carnations flowers all will wither

25 do not cry little isabella because your flowers have faded

26 not in germinal but in la terre a mistake of which i became aware only in the analysis here i would call attention to the identity of letters in huflattich and flatus

27 an unsolicited biographer dr f wittels reproaches me for having omitted the name of jehovah from the above motto the english medal contains the name of the deity in hebrew letters on the background of a cloud and placed in such a manner that one may equally well regard it as part of the picture or as part of the inscription

28 frauenzimmer german zimmerroom is appended to frauenwoman in order to imply a slight contempt tr 

29 another interpretation he is oneeyed like odin the father of the gods odins consolation the consolation in the childish scene i will buy him a new bed

30 here is some more material for interpretation holding the urineglass recalls the story of a peasant illiterate at the opticians who tried on now one pair of spectacles now another but was still unable to read peasantcatcher girlcatcher in the preceding portion of the dream the peasants treatment of the feebleminded father in zolas la terre the tragic atonement that in his last days my father soiled his bed like a child hence i am his nurse in the dream thinking and experiencing are here as it were identical this recalls a highly revolutionary closet drama by oscar panizza in which god the father is ignominiously treated as a palsied greybeard with him will and deed are one and in the book he has to be restrained by his archangel a sort of ganymede from scolding and swearing because his curses would immediately be fulfilled making plans is a reproach against my father dating from a later period in the development of the critical faculty much as the whole rebellious content of the dream which commits lese majeste and scorns authority may be traced to a revolt against my father the sovereign is called the father of his country landesvater and the father is the first and oldest and for the child the only authority from whose absolutism the other social authorities have evolved in the course of the history of human civilization in so far as motherright does not necessitate a qualification of this doctrine the words which occurred to me in the dream thinking and experiencing are the same thing refer to the explanation of hysterical symptoms with which the male urinal glass is also associated i need not explain the principle of gschnas to a viennese it consists in constructing objects of rare and costly appearance out of trivial and preferably comical and worthless material for example making suits of armour out of kitchen utensils wisps of straw and salzstangeln long rolls as our artists are fond of doing at their jolly parties i had learned that hysterical subjects do the same thing besides what really happens to them they unconsciously conceive for themselves horrible or extravagantly fantastic incidents which they build up out of the most harmless and commonplace material of actual experience the symptoms attach themselves primarily to these phantasies not to the memory of real events whether serious or trivial this explanation had helped me to overcome many difficulties and afforded me much pleasure i was able to allude to it by means of the dreamelement male urineglass because i had been told that at the last gschnas evening a poisonchalice of lucretia borgias had been exhibited the chief constituent of which had consisted of a glass urinal for men such as is used in hospitals

31 the stratification of the meanings of dreams is one of the most delicate but also one of the most fruitful problems of dream interpretation whoever forgets the possibility of such stratification is likely to go astray and to make untenable assertions concerning the nature of dreams but hitherto this subject has been only too imperfectly investigated so far a fairly orderly stratification of symbols in dreams due to urinary stimulus has been subjected to a thorough evaluation only by otto rankembed"
