i never saw the end in sight
fools are kind of blind
thought everything was going alright
but i was running out of time

cause you had one foot out the door
i swear i didnt see
but if youre really going away
heres some final words from me

chorus
baby write this down take a little note
to remind you in case you didnt know
tell yourself i love you and i dont want you to go
write this down
take my words and read them every day
keep them close by dont you let them fade away
so youll remember what i forgot to say
write this down

verse 2
ill sign it at the bottom of the page
ill swear under oath
cause every single word is true
and i think you need to know
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likeso use it as a bookmark
stick it on your refrigerator door
hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
where youll see it for sure

chorus

bridge
you can find a chisel i can find a stone
folks will be reading these words long after were gone

chorus

oh i love you and i dont want you to go
