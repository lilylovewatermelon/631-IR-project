i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavadgita
vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says now i am become death the destroyer of worlds

chorus
oh how can this be ive finally found peace
just how long til shes stripped from me
so come on baby in time well all freeze
aint no stoppin that entropy

verse 1
am i just a dog whos found me a bone
or perhaps if ive found a home
been sniffin around all over the town
i just cant stop settlin down

prechorus
his eyes on the sparrow eyes is on me
more eyes than the kgb
sometimes ill suffer sometimes ill bleed
not all at once time flows linearly
only forwards never backwards
seek the darkness seek the laughter
raise my jersey to the rafters
let moths consume me in the light

verse 2
so maybe my egos out of control

i hated myself when i was a boy
now that i dont theyre tryna take my joy

prechorus

the good lord he gives the lord he takes
no life without energy
