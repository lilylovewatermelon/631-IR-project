yeah something of a strong wind is coming over me
its got a hold of me yeah
thinking and doing things i shouldnt be
i really i shouldnt be

prechorus
yeah but one more call
its the one more “whatcha doing right now”
its the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
its the one more here we go again

chorus
one more drink leads to another
you slide up close to me
tearin tshirts off each other
your hands all over me
i tell myself im not in love
but one more time is not enough
one last kiss and then youre a goner
im lyin here wishin you could stay a little longer

verse 2
so calm and so cool yeah i try to be
like it dont bother me

until im all alone then im picking up the phone
