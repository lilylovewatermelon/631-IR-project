all your efforts all your acheivements all your attainments turning into dust nothingness what is the feeling what happens to you
the idea of god as the potter the architect of the universe it makes you feel that life is after all important that there is someone who cares it has meaning it has sense and you are valuable in the eyes of the father but after a while it got embarrassing the superstition the myth the absolutely unfounded idea why does anybody believe that
so you become an atheist and then you feel terrible after that because you got rid of god but that means you got rid of yourself youre just nothing but a machine and your idea that youre a machine is just a machine too a machine in the system
so if you think that thats the way things are you feel hostile to the world you feel that the world is a neurological trap into which you somehow got caught trapped you run from the maternity ward to the crematorium and thats it thats it so if youre a smart kid you commit suicide
now i want to propose another idea all together the real you is not a puppet which life pushes around the real you the real deep down you is the whole universe you cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin your skin doesnt separate you from the world its a bridge but just as a magnet polarizes itsself in north and south but its all one magnet so experience polarizes itself as self and other but its all one
what you call the external world is as much you as your own body most people think that when they open theyre eyes and look around that what they are seeing is outside it seems doesnt it that you are behind your eyes we havent realized that life and death black and white good and evil being and nonbeing come from the same center
when you look for your own particularized center of being which is separate from everything else you wont be able to find it the only way youll know it isnt there is if you look hard enough to find out that it isnt there it isnt there at all there isnt a separate you there are in physical reality no such things as separate events
people cant be talked out of illusions if a person believes that the earth is flat you cant talk him out of that he knows that its flat hell go down to the window and see that its obvious it looks flat so the only way to convince him that it isnt is to say well lets go and find the edgesee nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeembed"
