the view is shared by the leading establishment critic of cold war policies george kennan who writes that it was a historic error for the us to reject any effort to negotiate a peaceful settlement of conflicts with the russians for 40 years one of the benefits of the end of the cold war is that the clouds are finally lifting on these issues kennan too counsels that we restrict our foreign engagements we must bear in mind that it is primarily by example never by precept that a country such as ours exerts the most useful influence beyond its border countries unlike ours may undertake the grubbier pursuits we must also remember that there are limits to what one sovereign country can do to help another even a country such as ours others question that stance on the grounds that it is unfair to deprive suffering humanity of our attention necessarily benevolent1

to qualify for membership in respectable society one must appreciate a simple thesis we are perfect therefore we need only ask what is the right course for a saintly power how best we may proceed to save people from others or from themselves  not from us surely the tune is in fact a very familiar one an interesting topic for some other time

like earlier angelic powers we are able to recognize that there are some flaws and errors in the record but the sophisticated understand that history can teach no lessons about our institutions and the ways they have functioned surely nothing about what may lie ahead review of the historical record is nothing more than soundbites and invectives about washingtons historically evil foreign policy brown university professor thomas weiss writes with derision hence easy to ignore2 a perceptive comment accurately discerning the most valued principles of the commissar culture

discussion of the fashionable topic of the moral obligation of humanitarian intervention  not a trivial question  is rarely tainted by concerns about such matters we do not of course counsel that iran should undertake humanitarian intervention in bosnia as it has offered to do why because of its record and the nature of its institutions in the case of iran  or anyone else  inquiry into these questions is appropriate but not for us given our necessary perfection

it follows that any departures from the path of righteousness can only have been a reaction  perhaps excessive though understandable  to terrible dangers from which we defended ourselves and more recently the entire civilized world the cold war provides the favored current formula any lapse in recent years is attributable to the cosmic struggle with the russians thus if experimental subjects for radiation studies were chosen from bostons fernald school for mentally retarded children not an elite prep school that was unfortunate but understandable in the atmosphere of the cold war so it is alleged  about as plausibly as in most other cases and we have now changed course so that history may rest in peace

at the critical extreme we do find occasional notice of imperfection theres something troubling about the way we select our cases for intervention harvard historian stanley hoffmann observed in opening a conference at tufts university he noted that there has been no international cry to intervene in ethnic bloodshed in east timor the boston globe reported the example is instructive3

let us disregard the phrase ethnic bloodshed not quite the term applied to the soviet invasion of afghanistan or iraqs invasion of kuwait that aside some obvious questions come to mind just who might call for such intervention and how should it proceed by bombing washington and london the main supporters of indonesias aggression and mass slaughter suppose that a commentator in pregorbachev russia had found something troubling about soviet intervention policy wondering why russia did not intervene to prevent the imposition of martial law in poland or repression in czechoslovakia and hungary would we even laugh how could moscow intervene to bar the policies it actively supported these questions cannot arise however in our case whatever the facts given our perfection no one laughs

respectable british opinion is scarcely different writing in the london times higher education supplement leslie macfarlane emeritus politics fellow at st johns college in oxford recognizes that the us and uk to their shame failed to put pressure on president suharto to refrain from invasion of east timor but the 200000 or more deaths cannot be attributed to the west he adds reproaching edward herman for his calculations of the costs of western state terrorism which erroneously included this case no western promotion or support for the invasion and pacification of east timor in the early 1980s sic is laid at the wests door macfarlane instructs us with proper indignation4

there is no need to review the facts familiar outside of the doctrinal system which not only suppressed them with great efficiency as the terrible story unfolded but continues to do so today right now western oil companies are plundering east timors oil under a treaty between australia and indonesia terror and repression continue unabated and new atrocities have been discovered from the very recent past among them the slaughter of many people by indonesian doctors in hospitals after the november 1991 dili massacre but we must understand that the news room is a busy place and some things inevitably seep through the cracks  in a remarkably systematic way who can be expected to notice prominent stories in the british and australian press including even the guardian weekly widely circulated here one wonders whether the news room would have been too busy to notice libyan robbery of kuwaiti oil under a treaty with saddam hussein after he had occupied and annexed the country5

in the united states public protest has hampered government support for indonesian atrocities but not much congress cut off funds for military training but the clinton administration was undeterred on the anniversary of the usbacked indonesian invasion the state department announced that congresss action did not ban indonesias purchase of training with its own funds so it can proceed despite the ban such training has after all been quite successful in the past including the training of officers who took part in the highly praised slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people mostly landless peasants as the present government took power in 1965 secretary of defense robert mcnamara took particular pride in that fact informing lbj that us military assistance to the indonesian army had encouraged it to undertake the useful slaughter when the opportunity was presented particularly valuable mcnamara said was the program that brought indonesian military personnel to the united states for training at universities congress agreed noting the enormous dividends of us military training of the killers and continued communication with them the same training expedited the war crimes in timor and much else6

plainly it would be unfair to deprive the people of the region of such benefits that is exactly the position taken by advocates of us military training for example senator bennett johnson his evidence is a quote from the commander of the us forces in the pacific admiral larson who explains that by studying in our schools indonesian army officers gain an appreciation for our value system specifically respect for human rights adherence to democratic principles and the rule of law for similar reasons we must allow arms sales to indonesia so that we can continue to have a constructive dialogue and maintain our leverage and influence so benignly exercised in the past much as in latin america haiti the philippines and other places where us training has instilled such admirable respect for human rights7

1 defending human rights
with the support of senate democrats the administration was also able to block human rights conditions on aid to indonesia trade representative mickey kantor announced further that washington would suspend its annual review of indonesian labor practices agreeing with senator bennett who is impressed by the steps indonesia has takento improve conditions for workers in indonesia kantor commended indonesia for bringing its labor law and practice into closer conformity with international standards  a witticism that is in particularly poor taste though it must be conceded that indonesia did take some steps forward fearing that congress might override its friends in the white house reforms hastily pushed through by the indonesian government in recent months include withdrawing the authority of the military to intervene in strikes allowing workers to form a company union to negotiate labour contracts and raising the minimum wage in jakarta by 27 to about 2 a day the london guardian reports the new company unions that are magnanimously authorized must to be sure join the allindonesia labor union the staterun union to ensure that these promising advances toward international labor standards would not be misunderstood authorities also arrested 21 labor activists

we have done much to change and improve indonesias foreign minister said so according to us there is no reason to revoke the trade privileges clinton liberals evidently agree8

one effect of the activism of the 1960s was the pressure on congress to impose human rights conditions on aid trade and military sales every administration from carter until today has had to seek ways to evade such constraints in the 1980s it became a sick joke as the reaganites regularly assured congress always happy to be deceived that its favorite assassins and torturers were making impressive progress clinton is forging no new paths with his indonesia chicanery

other tasks are proving harder however notably china which must have its most favored nation mfn trade status renewed by june as ive reviewed in earlier articles china is not giving poor clinton much help in his endeavor to bypass the executive order that he issued imposing human rights conditions  in fear that congressional democrats might otherwise have forced an even more stringent approach through legislation thomas friedman reports in the new york times and because clinton did not want to appear to be going back on another campaign promise having strongly criticized president bush for coddling china9

the problem arose again as warren christopher visited beijing in march to express washingtons concerns on human rights which the state department hastened to explain are quite limited  in fact limited to finding means to evade congressional pressures john shattuck us assistant secretary of human rights clarified to the chinese leaders that clintons requirements for improvement are very narrow that pledges of progress may be enough what the president is looking for is an indication of directionthat is generally forward looking please please give us some straw so that we can respond to the needs of our constituency in the corporate sector the chinese however seem to enjoy watching their partners twist in the wind10

as christopher left for china the administration announced that it would once again relax the sanctions on high technology transfers this time by allowing the hughes aircraft company to launch a satellite from china this gesture of good will toward beijing is one part of the strategy to engage china rather than to isolate it elaine sciolino reported in the new york times asked about this decision while china is under pressure on issues of missile proliferation and human rights christopher responded that it simply sends a signal of evenhanded treatment the good will gesture as usual is directed towards a leading segment of the publicly subsidized private enterprise system much like the goodwill gestures announced at the asiapacific summit last november which allowed china to purchase supercomputers nuclear power generators and satellites despite their adaptability to weapons and missile proliferation the pentagon also sent high officials with christopher to discuss ways to upgrade the two countries military relationship sciolino reported another part of the strategy11

christopher did not return emptyhanded at a white house session thomas friedman reports he presented a chartshowing that on many fronts china was making some progress toward meeting the terms of the presidents executive order but that forward movement had been obscured by the confrontational atmosphere of his visit on leaving beijing he had stated that his discussions with the chinese leaders were businesslike and productive the differences between china and the us are narrowing somewhat christopher informed the press though he was hard put to point to examples of specific progress on the vexed human rights issue beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour products the london financial times commented china did once again agree to restrict exports from prison factories to the united states12

such exports have greatly exercised washington and the press the sole labor rights issue to have achieved this status us inspections of jail exports likely in china a frontpage story by thomas friedman was headlined in the new york times in january the chinese agreed to a demand to allow more visits by american customs inspectors to chinese prison factories to make sure they are not producing goods for export to the united states he reported from beijing us influence is having further benign effects forcing liberalization factory by factory including contract bankruptcy and other laws that are critical elements of a market economy all welcome steps towards a virtuous circle

unmentioned are a few other questions about economic virtue horrifying labor conditions for example perhaps the case of 81 women burned to death locked into their factory last november which merited a few lines in the national press in the midst of much euphoria about clintons grand vision of a free market future in the asiapacific region or 60 workers killed in a fire a few weeks later in another foreignowned factory or the doubling of deaths in industrial accidents last year with over 11000 just in the first eight months chinese officials and analysts say the accidents stem from abysmal working conditions which combined with long hours inadequate pay and even physical beatings are stirring unprecedented labor unrest among chinas booming foreign joint ventures sheila tefft reported in the christian science monitor that problem is a real one the tensions reveal the great gap between competitive foreign capitalists lured by cheap chinese labor and workers weaned on socialist job security and the safety net of cradletograve benefits workers do not yet understand that in the capitalist utopia we are preparing for them they are to be beaten for producing poor quality goods fired for dozing on the job during long work hours and other such misdeeds and locked into their factories to be burned to death but we understand all of that so china is not called to account for violations of labor rights only for exporting prison products to the united states13

why the distinction simplicity itself prison factories are stateowned industry and exports to the us interfere with profits unlike locking women into factories beating workers and other such means to improve the balance sheet qed

accuracy requires a few qualifications thus the rules allow the united states to sell prison goods  for export they are not permitted to enter us markets california and oregon export prisonmade clothing to asia including specialty jeans shirts and a line of shorts quaintly called prison blues the prisoners earn far less than the minimum wage and work under slave labor conditions prison rights activists allege but their products do not interfere with the rights that count so there is no problem here14

the clinton administration has been quietly signaling beijing that if it met washingtons minimum human rights demands the united states would consider ending the annual threat of trade sanctions to change chinas behavior friedman reports the reason is that the old human rights policy imposed by congressional ultimately popular pressures is outmoded and should be replaced this is a major shift in policy which reflects the increasing importance of trade to the american economy the human rights policy is also outmoded other officials argue because trade is now such an important instrument for opening up chinese society for promoting the rule of law and the freedom of movement there and for encouraging private property15

the hypocrisy is stunning though hardly more than the human rights policy that is now outmoded which was always carefully crafted to avoid endangering profits and to somehow not see huge atrocities carried out by us clients under washingtons sponsorship human rights concerns have been a passion in the case of nicaragua and cuba subjected to crushing embargoes and terror in such cases trade is not an instrument that induces good behavior the criminals have to be restored to their service role if cynical posturing about human rights contributes to that end well and good the same was true of the soviet empire which also had to be returned to its traditional third world role providing resources investment opportunities markets cheap labor and other amenities as it had for hundreds of years an essential feature of the cold war since 1918 in the real world until that end was achieved trade was not an instrument to help lift the chains the same was true of china until it began to open its doors to foreign investment and control offering wonderful opportunities for profit  or in technical newspeak jobs
2 promoting democracy

our current vocation as everyone knows is promoting democracy there are many illuminating examples since the fall of the berlin wall freed us from the cold war burden

the first and one of the most revealing is nicaragua recall that just as the wall fell the white house and congress announced with great clarity that unless nicaraguans voted as we told them the terrorist war and the embargo that was strangling the country would continue washington also voted alone with israel against a un general assembly resolution calling on it once again to observe international law and call off these illegal actions unthinkable of course so the press continued to observe its vow of silence when nicaraguans met their obligations a few months later joy was unrestrained at the dissident extreme anthony lewis hailed washingtons experiment in peace and democracy which gives fresh testimony to the power of jeffersons idea government with the consent of the governed to say so seems romantic but then we live in a romantic age across the spectrum there was rejoicing over the latest of the happy series of democratic surprises as time magazine expressed the uniform view while outlining the methods used to achieve our jeffersonian ideals to wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves with a cost to us that is minimal leaving the victim with wrecked bridges sabotaged power stations and ruined farms and providing washingtons candidate with a winning issue ending the impoverishment of the people of nicaragua

it would be hard to imagine a more conclusive demonstration of the understanding of democracy in the dominant political and intellectual culture it is inconceivable that the clear and unmistakeable meaning of any of this should enter the respectable culture or probably even history16

that interesting story continues on march 15 us assistant secretary of state alexander watson announced that with the conflicts of the past behind us the clinton administration accepts the sandinistas as a legitimate political force in nicaragua with all the rights and obligations of any party in a democracy supposing that it uses only peaceful and legitimate methods as we did through the 1980s setting the stage for a fair election by us standards the brief reuters report noted that the united states financed the contra rebels against the sovietbacked sandinista government translating from newspeak washington followed standard procedure doing everything it could to compel nicaragua to abandon its despicable efforts to maintain a nonaligned stand and balanced trade and to turn to the russians as a last resort so that washingtons attack could be construed as part of the cold war conflict raging in our backyard now to be dispatched to the category of irrelevance for understanding ourselves or what the future holds17

washingtons willingness to accept the sandinistas as a legitimate political force if they mind their manners cannot claim the prize for moral cowardice and depravity that is still held by washingtons display of magnanimity towards the vietnamese now permitted to enter the civilized world their many crimes against us put to the side though not of course forgiven once us business made it clear that the pleasure of torturing our victims must give way to the more important task of enrichment of the wealthy

the next example of our postcold war passion for democracy was the invasion of panama a month after the berlin wall fell the first exercise of humanitarian intervention in the postcold war era operation just cause may have served as a model for saddam hussein shortly after the cheering section now quietly concedes bushs greatest fear when iraq invaded kuwait seems to have been that saddam would mimic his achievement in panama according to the account of washington planning by investigative reporter bob woodward regarded as generally convincing by us government middle east specialist william quandt president bush feared that the saudis would bug out at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in kuwait after iraqi withdrawal his advisers expected that iraq would withdraw leaving behind lots of iraqi special forces in civilian clothes if not armed forces as the us did in panama while taking over two uninhabited mudflats that had been assigned to kuwait in the british imperial settlement to block iraqs access to the sea gen norman schwartzkopf chief of staff gen colin powell warned that the status quo would be changed under the influence of the aggressors even after withdrawal again as in panama

in a highlypraised academic study regarded as the standard current work of scholarship on this textbook case of aggression and the reaction to it university of london historians lawrence freedman and efraim karsh who labor to present the usuk effort in the most favorable possible light conclude that saddam apparently intended neither officially to annex the tiny emirate nor to maintain a permanent military presence there instead he sought to establish hegemony over kuwait ensuring its complete financial political and strategic subservience to his wishes much as intended by the us in panama and achieved saddams scheme turned sour they continue because of the international reaction to translate to doctrinally unacceptable truth because the us and britain did not follow their usual practice of vetoing or otherwise nullifying the international reaction to such textbook cases of aggression as ussouth vietnam turkeycyprus indonesiaeast timor israellebanon uspanama and many others18

operation just cause was presented as a textbook case of washingtons dedication to democracy  quite accurately as it turned out in the latest of its annual reports on human rights january 1994 panamas governmental human rights commission charged that the right to selfdetermination and sovereignty of the panamanian people continues to be violated by the state of occupation by a foreign army reviewing us army airforce and dea operations in panama including a dea agents assault on a panamanian journalist and attacks on panamanian citizens by us military personnel the nongovernmental human rights commission in its accompanying report democracy and human rights in panamafour years later added that democracy has meant nothing more than formal voting while government policies do not attend to the necessities of the most impoverished  whose numbers have significantly increased since the liberation within a year after the invasion latin americanist stephen ropp observes washington was well aware that removing the mantle of united states protection would quickly result in a civilian or military overthrow of president endara and his supporters that is the puppet regime of bankers businessmen and narcotraffickers installed by the occupying army drugs and their rewards are more visible today than in general noriegas time the economist reports in march including hard drugs a senior employee of the panama branch of merrill lynch was one of those recently caught in a dea operation as they were laundering colombian cocaine cash through panamas large financial industry the one real economic success story of the occupation by a foreign army all they were doing is what almost every bank in panama does a local investigative reporter commented all exactly as predicted when the troops landed to restore the mainly white oligarchy to power and ensure us control over the strategically important region and its financial institutions

an election is scheduled for may far ahead in polls is perez balladares the candidate of the democratic revolutionary party prd the party of populist dictator omar torrijos and manuel noriega balladares was noriegas campaign manager for the 1989 election that noriega stole causing much outrage in the us because he was no longer following washingtons orders when he was still a good boy in 1984 he was lauded by reagan shultz et al for stealing the election with considerably greater fraud and violence balladares has learned his lessons and should cause no problems19

other exercises of democracy enhancement in the region proceed on course in november 1993 hondurans went to the polls for the fourth time since 1980 they voted against the neoliberal structural adjustment programs that have had the usual consequences but the gesture is empty the rich and powerful will permit nothing else the voters have no real options for improving their living standards which worsen every day mexicos major newspaper excelsior reported  familiar with economic miracles in its own country threefourths of those who went to the polls live in misery and are disenchanted with formal democracy hondurans purchasing power is lower than in the 1970s before the gift of democracy was granted by the united states while turning honduras into a military base for its war against nicaragua and establishing more firmly the rule of the generals there are other beneficiaries the honduran college of economists points out a group of privileged exporters and local investors linked to financial capital and multinational corporations who have multiplied their capital in a country where growing economic polarization is generating ever more evident constrasts between the rich who do not hide the ostentation of their moral misery and the every more miserable poor at least one of every two dollars coming to honduras has left in the last three years 199193 to pay the interest on more than 3 billion foreign debt excelsior continues debt service now represents 40 of exports and though almost 20 of the debt was forgiven it has increased by almost 10 since 199020

in march 1994 the democracy enhancement project reached el salvador the elections conducted in the 1980s to legitimize the usbacked terror state were hailed at the time as impressive steps towards democracy demonstration elections as edward herman accurately called them but with the policy imperatives of those days gone the pretense has been quietly shelved it is the 1994 elections that are to represent the triumph of washingtons dedication to democracy

the elections are indeed an innovation in that at least the forms were maintained pretty much tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote because they did not appear on electoral lists the financial times reported while some 74000 people a high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the fmln were excluded because they did not have birth certificates fmln leaders alleged that more than 300000 voters were excluded in such ways charging massive fraud the left coalition presidential candidate rubn zamora estimated conservatively that over 10 of voters were barred the un mission downplayed the problems but independent observers were not convinced i used to give them the benefit of the doubt the official british observer commented but it comes to the point when you have to say it is bad faith referring to the bad administration of the election by the governing arena party which received almost half the votes cast and the un mission reaction21
but the irregularities whatever they may have been do not change the fact that the elections broke new ground at a formal level there was no blatant fraud or massive terror rather minor fraud against the background of the successful use of terror and repression with a narrow aspect that received some attention and a broader and more significant one that did not

in the 1994 elections the us naturally supported arena the party of the death squads a fact understood throughout though denied for propaganda reasons partial declassification of documents has revealed that much it also illustrates once again why documents are classified in the first place not for security reasons as alleged but to undermine american democracy by protecting state power from popular scrutiny in february 1985 the cia reported that behind arenas legitimate exterior lies a terrorist network led by daubuisson and funded by wealthy salvadoran expatriates residing in guatemala and the united states using both activeduty and retired military personnel in their campaigns death squads in the armed forces operate out of both urban military headquarters and rural outposts the main death squad the secret anticommunist army was described by the cia as the paramilitary organization of arena led by the constituent assembly security chief and drawing most of its members from the national police and other security forces the military and police themselves of course were the major terrorist forces carrying out the great mass of the atrocities against the civilian population funded directly from washington which was also responsible for their training and direction22

as the 1994 elections approached there was a resurgence in death squadstyle murders and death threats americas watch observed concluding that no issue represents a greater threat to the peace process than the rise in political murders of leaders and grassroots activists of the fmln assassinations that became more frequent brazen and selective in the fall of 1993 these injected a level of fear almost impossible to measure into the campaign enhanced by government coverups and refusal to investigate part of a pattern of violation of the peace treaty to which we return the governments own human rights office and the un observer mission reported the grave deterioration in citizen security made worse by organized violence in the political arena this proceeds against the backdrop of an astronomical rise of crime in postwar el salvador americas watch reports and reliable evidence that the army and national police are involved in organized crime23

the major political opposition rubn zamoras left coalition not only lacked resources for the campaign that was virtually monopolized by arena but was unable to convince supporters or sympathizers to appear in campaign ads because they fear retaliation from the right new york times terror continued at a level sufficient to give substance to such fears among those who took the threat seriously was jos mara mendez named el salvadors lawyer of the century by three prestigious legal associations he fled the country shortly after threatened with death unless he convinced the vicepresidential candidate of the left coalition to resign

foreign observers were struck by the lack of popular interest in the elections of the century salvadorans ambivalent toward historic poll a headline in the christian science monitor read reporting fear and apathy and concern that war will return unless arena wins the abstention rate about 45 was about the same as 10 years earlier at the peak of the violence a conservative political analyst quoted by the new york times hctor dada attributed the low participation to a deliberate disenfranchisment of voters and a sense of apathy among the electorate as for those who voted another analyst luis cardenal observed that the electorate voted more than anything for tranquillity for security the warweary populace bought the ruling partys party line which equated arena with security and the left with instability and violence christian science monitor reporter david clark scott added that is plausible enough any other outcome could be expected to lead to revival of the largescale terror and atrocities24

these assessments bear on the broader aspects of the successful use of violence before the election church and popular sources attributed the climate of apathy to the fact that hunger and poverty reign among a population whose demands have received no attention which makes the electoral climate difficult notimex mexico25 in the 1970s popular organizations were proliferating in part under church auspices seeking to articulate these demands in the political arena and to work to overcome hunger poverty and harsh oppression it was that popular awakening that elicited the response of the state terror apparatus and its superpower sponsor committed as always to a form of democracy enhancement that bars the threat of democracy  by extreme violence if necessary as in this case here as elsewhere the programs of the terrorist superpower were highly successful leading to the climate of apathy the search for security above all else and the general conditions in which free elections become tolerable

recall the conclusion of reaganite official thomas carothers who recognizes that the democracy enhancement programs in which he was involved inevitably sought only limited topdown forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the united states has long been allied maintaining the basic order ofquite undemocratic societies and avoiding populistbased change that might upset established economic and political orders and open a leftist direction nothing has changed in this regard

a january 1994 conference of jesuits and lay associates in san salvador considered both the narrow and broad aspects of the state terrorist project its summary report concludes that it is important to explore to what degree terror continues to act cloaked by the mask of common crime also to be explored is what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the expectations of the majority visavis alternatives different to those of the powerful in a context in which many of the revolutionaries of yesterday act today with values similar to the long powerful26

the latter issue the broader one is of particular significance the great achievement of the massive terror operations of the past years organized by washington and its local associates has been to destroy hope the observation generalizes to much of the third world and also to the growing masses of superfluous people at home as the third world model of sharply twotiered societies is increasingly internationalized these are major themes of the new world order being constructed by the privileged sectors of global society with us state and private power in the lead

3 rewarding democracy

a particularly instructive illustration of the democracy enhancement program in the region is colombia which seems to have taken first place in the competition for leading terrorist state in latin america  and to the surprise of no one familiar with soundbites and invectives about washingtons historically evil foreign policy has become the leading recipient of us military aid accompanied by much praise for its stellar accomplishments

in the march 1994 issue of current history latin americanist john martz writes that colombia now enjoys one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in latin america and in political terms its democratic structures notwithstanding inevitable flaws are among the most solid on the continent a model of wellestablished political stability the clinton administration is particularly impressed by outgoing president csar gaviria whom it is now promoting as next secretary general of the organization of american states because as the us representative to the oas explained he has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so and also on economic reform in colombia and on economic integration in the hemisphere code words that are readily interpreted27

that it has been dangerous to build democratic institutions in colombia is true enough thanks primarily to president gaviria his predecessors and their fervent supporters in washington

the inevitable flaws are reviewed in some detail  once again  in current publications of americas watch and amnesty international28 they find appalling levels of violence the worst in the hemisphere since 1986 more than 20000 people have been killed for political reasons most of them by the colombian military and police and the paramilitary forces that are closely linked to them for example the private army of rancher emerald dealer and reputed drug dealer victor carranza considered to be the largest in the country dedicated primarily to the destruction of the leftwing political opposition patriotic union up in alliance with police and military officers the department in which carranza operates meta is one of the most heavily militarized with some 35000 troops and thousands of police nevertheless paramilitary forces and hired killers operate freely carrying out massacres and political assassinations an official government inquiry in the early 80s found that over a third of the members of paramilitary groups engaged in political killings and other terror in colombia were activeduty military officers the pattern continues including the usual alliances with private power and criminal sectors

more than 1500 leaders members and supporters of up have been assassinated since the party was established in 1985 this systematic elimination of the leadership of up is the most dramatic expression of political intolerance in recent years ai observes  one of the inevitable flaws that make it dangerous to build democratic institutions if not quite the danger that the clinton administration wants us to notice other dangers were illustrated at the march 1994 elections largely bought by the powerful cali cocaine cartel critics allege noting the history of votebuying in this stable democracy the vast amounts of money spent by the cartel and the low turnout29

the pretext for terror operations is the war against guerrillas and narcotraffickers the former a very partial truth the latter a myth amnesty international concludes in agreement with other investigators the myth was concocted in large measure to replace the communist threat as the cold war was fading along with the propaganda system based on it in reality the official security forces and their paramilitary associates work hand in glove with the drug lords organized crime landowners and other private interests in a country where avenues of social action have long been closed and are to be kept that way by intimidation and terror the governments own commission to overcome violence concluded that the criminalization of social protest is one of the principal factors which permit and encourage violations of human rights by the military and police authorities and their paramilitary collaborators

the problems have become much worse in the past 10 years particularly during president gavirias term when violence reached unprecedented levels the washington office on latin america wola reports with the national police taking over as the leading official killers while us aid shifted to them 1992 was the most violent year in colombia since the 1950s wola reported in early 1993 which proved to be still worse30 atrocities run the gamut familiar in the spheres of us influence and support death squads disappearance torture rape massacre of civilian populations under the doctrine of collective responsibility and aerial bombardment the speciallytrained counterinsurgency and mobile brigades are among the worst offenders targets include community leaders human rights and health workers union activists students members of religious youth organizations and young people in shanty towns but primarily peasants merely to give one example from august 1992 to august 1993 217 union activists were murdered a point that demonstrates the strong intolerance on the part of the state of union activity the andean commission of jurists comments31 the official concept of terrorism has been extended to virtually anyone opposing government policies the human rights reports observe

one project of the security forces and their allies is social cleansing  that is murder of vagrants and unemployed street children prostitutes homosexuals and other undesirables the ministry of defense formulated the official attitude toward the matter in response to a compensation claim there is no case for the payment of any compensation by the nation particularly for an individual who was neither useful nor productive either to society or to his family

the security forces also murder suspects another practice familiar in us domains it is for example standard operating procedure for israeli forces in the occupied territories passing with little notice among the paymasters who accept it as routine thus the day before the hebron massacre of february 25 soldiers fired antitank rockets and grenades at a stone house near jerusalem killing one palestinian and wounding another who were accused by the army in the slaying of an undercover agent and other actions the press casually reported32

the plague of murder for sale of organs rampant through the domains of us influence has not spared colombia where undesirables are killed so that their corpses can be chopped up and sold on the black market for body parts ai it is not known whether children are sold and killed for organ transplants as in el salvador where the practice is officially conceded and according to extensive report elsewhere in the region

as human rights groups and others observe the colombian model is that of el salvador and guatemala the doctrines instilled by us advisers and trainers can be traced back directly to the nazis as michael mcclintock documented in an important study that has been ignored colombia has also enjoyed the assistance of british german and israeli mercenaries who train assassins and perform other services for the narcomilitarylandlord combine in their war against peasants and potential social activism to my knowledge there has been no attempt to investigate the report of colombian intelligence that north americans have also been engaged in these operations or any notice of it in the mainstream

other similarities to washingtons salvadorguatemala model abound consider for example the case of major luis felipe becerra charged with responsibility for an army massacre by a civilian judge who fled the country under death threats days after issuing the arrest warrant her father was then murdered but the warrants were not served because major becerra was then in the united states undergoing a training course for promotion to lieutenantcolonel returning after his promotion ltcol becerra was appointed to head the armys press and public relations department despite a recommendation by the procurator delegate to the armed forces that he be dismissed for his part in the peasant massacre in april 1993 charges against him were dropped in october he was again implicated in a massacre of unarmed civilians under the pretext of a battle against guerrillas troops under his command executed 13 people in a rural area the victims were unarmed the women were raped and tortured according to residents of the area33

but impunity prevails as is regularly the case

the story is that of central america haiti brazil indeed wherever the monroe doctrine extends along with the philippines iran under the shah and other countries that share an elusive property34

whatever could it be whatever it is we are strictly enjoined not to see it and to learn nothing from it

a detailed 1992 investigation by european and latin american church and human rights organizations concludes that state terrorism in colombia is a reality it has its institutions its doctrine its structures its legal arrangements its means and instruments its victims and above all its responsible authorities its goal is systematic elimination of opposition criminalization of large sectors of the population massive resort to political assassination and disappearance general use of torture extreme powers for the security forces exceptional legislation etc state terror in colombia the modern version has its roots in the security doctrines pioneered by the kennedy administration which established them officially in a crucial 1962 decision that shifted the mission of the latin american military from hemispheric defense to internal security the war against the internal enemy understood in practice to be those who challenge the traditional order of domination and control

the doctrines were expounded in us manuals of counterinsurgency and low intensity conflict and developed further by local security authorities they benefited from training and direction by us advisers and experts new technologies of repression and improved structures and methodologies to maintain stability and obedience the result is a highly efficient apparatus of official terror designed for total war by state power in the political economic and social arenas as the colombian minister of defense articulated the standard doctrine in 1989 while officially the targets were guerrilla organizations a high military official explained in 1987 that these were only of minor importance the real danger is what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war the war to control the popular elements and to manipulate the masses the subversives hope to influence unions universities media and so on therefore the state terror inquiry observes the internal enemy of the state terrorist apparatus extends to labor organizations popular movements indigenous organizations opposition political parties peasant movements intellectual sectors religious currents youth and student groups neighborhood organizations and so on all legitimate targets for destruction because they must be secured against undesirable influences every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner a 1963 military manual prescribed as the kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear

the war against the internal enemy escalated in the 1980s as the reaganites updated the kennedy doctrines moving from legal repression to systematic employment of political assassination and disappearance later massacres state terror atrocities escalated a new judicial regime in 1988 allowed maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition in order to implement what was officially called total war against the internal enemy the use of paramilitary auxiliaries for terror explicitly authorized in military manuals also took new and more comprehensive forms and alliances with industrialists ranchers and landowners and later narcotraffickers were more firmly entrenched the 1980s saw the consolidation of state terror in colombia the inquiry concludes35

in its december 1993 study americas watch observes that most of the materiel used by and training provided the colombian army and police come from the united states mainly counterinsurgency equipment and training a study of the drug war by the us general accounting office in august 1993 concluded that us military officials have not fully implemented enduse monitoring procedures to ensure that colombias military is using aid primarily for counternarcotic purposes an oversight with few consequences considering what falls under the rubric of counternarcotic purposes washingtons own interpretation of such purposes was nicely illustrated in early 1989 when colombia asked it to install a radar system to monitor flights from the south the source of most of the cocaine for the drug merchants the us government fulfilled the request  in a sense it installed a radar system on san andrs island in the caribbean 500 miles from mainland colombia and as far removed as possible on colombian territory from the drug routes but welllocated for the intensive surveillance of nicaragua that was a critical component of the terrorist war then peaking as washington sought to conclude its demolition of the peace process of the central american presidents as it did another fact unlikely to enter history a costa rican request for radar assistance in the drug war ended up the same way36

from 1984 through 1992 6844 colombian soldiers were trained under the us international military education and training program over 2000 from 1990 to 1992 as atrocities were mounting like their counterparts elsewhere they were thus able to gain an appreciation for our value system specifically respect for human rights adherence to democratic principles and the rule of law as admiral larson and senator bennett explained the colombian program is the largest in the hemisphere three times that of el salvador us advisors are helping build military bases officially to increase the battlefronts against the guerrillas and narcotrafficking operations four have been constructed five more are underway according to the us embassy the real targets will be evident from the record elsewhere in the region or in colombia itself

washington is also supporting the public order courts that operate under conditions that severely undermine civil rights and due process again the parallel to el salvador is obvious one of the requirements of the unbrokered peace accord was that the salvadoran government dismantle the supreme court largely an appendage of the death squad apparatus run by the state and its private sector allies the agreement was ignored like the requirement that the national police noted for their brutality be dismantled and replaced by a new national civilan police pnc that is not under army control and includes the fmln government figuresshow that instead of phasing out the old national police force as called for by the peace accord it actually has increased by about 2000 men to 10500 the chicago tribune reported in further violation of the agreement the arena government in 1992 transferred to the national police 1000 members of the treasury police and national guard which were to be abolished because of their notorious human rights abuses former members were accepted to training programs for the pnc an explicit violation of the accord americas watch notes the expanding national police are considered responsible for 35 of human rights violations reported to the un observers in 1993 a larger share than any other force americas watch continues reviewing also a series of other government violations of the accords designed to sustain the terror system either in official or privatized form time is on the side of the government a un official observed it is only necessary to hold out until the un mission ends and then the remnants of the peace accords can be completely scrapped going the way of the central american peace accords of 198737

since there is no interest here el salvador too proceeds towards a stable democracy though with inevitable flaws such as those already mentioned

in july 1989 the state department submitted a report entitled justification for determination to authorize exportimport act guarantees and insurance for sales of military equipment to colombia for antinarcotics purposes the official cover story the report states colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights three months later the un special rapporteur on summary executions amos wako returned from a visit to colombia with severe warnings about the extreme violence of the paramilitary forces in coordination with drug lords and government security forces there are currently over 140 paramilitary groups operating in colombia today which are trained and financed by drug traffickers and possibly a few landowners they operate very closely with elements in the armed forces and the police most of the killings and massacres carried out by the paramilitary groups occur in areas which are heavily militarized where they are able to move easilyand commit murders with impunity in some cases the military or police either turn a blind eye to what is being done by paramilitary groups or give suport by offering safe conduct passes to members of the paramilitary or by impeding investigation his mandate did not extend to the direct terror of the security forces which far outweighs the depredations of its informal allies

a few months before the state department praise for colombias humane democracy a jesuitsponsored development and research organization published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988 including over 3000 politicallymotivated killings 273 in social cleansing campaigns38 excluding those killed in combat political killings averaged 8 a day with seven murdered in their homes or in the street and one disappeared the vast majority of those who have disappeared in recent years wola added are grassroots organizers peasant or union leaders leftist politicians human rights workers and other activists over 1500 by the time of the state department endorsement perhaps the state department had in mind the recent 1988 mayoral campaigns in which 29 of the 87 mayoral candidates of the up were assassinated along with over 100 of its candidates for municipal councilor the central organization of workers a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986 had by then lost over 230 members most of them found dead after brutal torture

recall also that in 1988 the more advanced forms of maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition were instituted for total war against the internal enemy as the regime of state terror consolidated by the time the state department report appeared the methods of control it found praiseworthy were being still more systematically implemented from 1988 through early 1992 9500 people were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres between 1988 and 1990 of peasants and poor people39

the primary victims of atrocities were as usual the poor mainly peasants in one southern department grassroots organizations testified in february 1988 that a campaign of total annihilation and scorched earth vietnamstyle was being conducted by the military forces in a most criminal manner with assassinations of men women elderly and children homes and crops are burned obligating the peasants to leave their lands the state department had a plethora of evidence of this sort before it when it cleared colombia of human rights violations its own official human rights reports attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas and narcotraffickers so that the us was justified in providing the mass murderers and torturers with military equipment putting our taxes to good use

that of course was the bad old days of 1989 when we were still defending civilization from the russian threat moving to the present matters become worse for reasons explained by president gaviria in may 1992 when questioned about atrocities by the military in the colombian press he responded that the battle against the guerrillas must be waged on unequal terms the defense of human rights of democratic principles of the separation of powers could prove to be an obstacle for the counterinsurgency struggle40

during the bush years the us embassy did not make a single public statement urging the government to curb political or military abuses wola observes while us support for the military and police increased41 but now that liberal democrats have taken over the clinton administration has called for a change in policy towards the colombian killers more active us participation for fiscal year 1994 the administration requested that military financing and training funds be increased by over 12 reaching about half of proposed military aid for all of latin america congressional budget cuts for the pentagon interfered with these plans so the administration intends to use emergency drawdown authority to bolster the colombia account americas watch reports congress however is continuing to interfere taking note of continuing human rights abuses on a large scale and imposing conditions on us aid which the administration will have to find ways to evade with the usual formulas and devices the senate also urged the colombian government to permit red cross access to police and detention facilities which it has generally denied

the human rights organizations amnesty international human rights watch are committed to international conventions on human rights thus ai reports open by stating that the organization works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights and other international standards in practice however the commitment is skewed in accord with western standards which are significantly different the united states in particular rejects the universality of the universal declaration amidst much posturing about our noble defense of the sacred principle of universality and selfrighteous denunciation of the cultural relativism of the backward peoples who fall short of our exalted standards the united states has always flatly rejected the sections of the universal declaration dealing with social and economic rights and also consistently disregards ignores and violates much of the remainder of the declaration  even putting aside its massive involvement in terror torture and other abuses

the human rights groups say little about social and economic rights generally adopting the highly biased western perspective on these matters in the case of colombia we have to go beyond these in themselves very valuable reports to discover the roots of the extraordinary violence they are not obscure the president of the colombian permanent committee for human rights former minister of foreign affairs alfredo v squez carrizosa writes that it is poverty and insufficient land reform that have made colombia one of the most tragic countries of latin america and are the source of the violence including the mass killings of the 1940s and early 1950s which took hundreds of thousands of lives land reform was legislated in 1961 but has practically been a myth unimplemented because landowners have had the power to stop it in this admirable democracy with its constitutional regime which v squez carrizosa dismisses as a facade granting rights that have no relation to reality the violence has been caused by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished excluded majority with great differences in wealth income and access to political participation

and as elsewhere in latin america violence has been exacerbated by external factors primarily the initiatives of the kennedy administration which took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades accepting the new strategy of the death squads ushering in what is known in latin america as the national security doctrinenot defense against an external enemy but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the gamewith the right to combat the internal enemy as set forth in the brazilian doctrine the argentine doctrine the uruguayan doctrine and the colombian doctrine it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers trade unionists men and women who are not supportive of the establishment and who are assumed to be communist extremists42

it is in this precise sense no other that the cold war guided our policies

the results are an income distribution that is dramatically skewed wola observes another striking feature of the domains of longstanding us influence from which we are again to learn nothing the top three percent of colombias landed elite own over 70 of arable land while 57 of the poorest farmers subsist on under 3 40 of colombians live in absolute poverty unable to satisfy basic subsistence needs according to a 1986 report of the national administration bureau of statistics while 18 live in absolute misery unable to meet nutritional needs the colombian institute of family welfare estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry that is one of every two children in this triumph of capitalism a country of enormous resources and potential lauded as one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in latin america martz43

the stable democracy does exist but as what jenny pearce calls democracy without the people the majority of whom are excluded from the political system monopolized by elites more so as political space has been rapidly closing by the mid1980s for colombian elites the international funding agencies and foreign investors democracy functions but it is not intended for the public generally who are marginalized economically and politically the state has reserved for the majority the state of siege and all the exceptional repressive legislation and procedures that can guarantee order where other mechanisms fail pearce continues increasingly in recent years that is democracy in exactly the sense of regular practice and even doctrine if we attend closely

no discussion of democracy enhancement in the current era can fail to consider haiti a sickening story that requires separate treatment particularly now when clinton administration efforts to undermine haitian democracy have reached such a sordid level that even his allies are deserting the ship as of march the latest revelation of clintonite deceit on restoring democracy to haiti was the congressional testimony of lawrence pezzullo the secretary of states special adviser for haiti pezzullo was questioned about a plan portrayed as a haitian solution spawned by weeks of tough negotiations in washington among disparate leaders of haitian society christopher marquis reported in the miami herald the clinton administration had strongly supported the plan as the optimal solution representing haitian democrats it harshly condemned aristide for his intransigence in rejecting the plan  which true enough ignored such minor matters as the return of the elected president to haiti and the removal of the worst of the state terrorists from power pezzullo conceded that the plan had in fact been spawned in the offices of the state department which selected the haitian negotiators who were to ratify it in washington included among them were rightwing extremists with close military ties notably frantzrobert mond a former member of duvaliers terrorist tontons macoute and a close associate of police chief ltcol joseph michel francois the most brutal and powerful of the haitian state terrorists incidentally another beneficiary of us training

in other words the operation was a hoax larry birns director of the council on hemispheric affairs yet another effort to ensure that democracy is enhanced in haiti in the familiar way  without any populistbased change that might upset established economic and political orders and open a leftist direction carothers44

ill save until next time the haitian illustration of the romantic age to which we have led suffering humanity



part ii
the case of haiti

julyaugust 1994

as discussed in part i the reaganbush administrations reluctantly adopted prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change and inevitably sought only limited topdown forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the united states has long been allied thomas carothers of the reagan state department the leading idea is revealed in the documents of usaids democracy project which stress that the us supports processes of democratic institutional reform that will further economic liberalization objectives  that is entrenchment of the service role1

the reference to the traditional structures of power with which the united states has long been allied has to undergo the usual translation the phrase united states refers to the traditional structures of power at home this is among the elementary truths that are to remain unspoken along with the fact that the policies for the service areas merely adapt a conception of democracy that is to apply to the home societies as well here the general public must be put in its place as walter lippmann explained in his progressive essays on democracy long ago the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders are to be only interested spectators of action not participants their sole function in a democracy is to choose periodically among the leadership class elections also unspoken is the fact that the responsible men who manage the democratic society gain that status by virtue of their service to the traditional structures of power there is a very broad consensus in the intellectual community and of course the business world that the ignorant and incapable mass of humanity must not be allowed to disrupt policy formation woodrow wilsons secretary of state robert lansing that planners must be insulated from politics in world bank lingo

the prodemocracy policies in the service areas long antedate the reaganites and have little to do with the cold war apart from ideological cover accordingly they should be expected to persist as they do among the cases reviewed in part i the most striking is colombia which has become the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and the recipient of more than half of total us military aid and training sent on its way with the usual acclaim for colombias democratic achievements as state terror mounts  all rising to new heights under clinton

human rights enhancement marches on in parallel in part i i reviewed clintons steps to evade congressional efforts to impose human rights conditions on military aid and trade privileges for indonesia and china and the concept of human rights itself crafted to evade atrocities that contribute to profit in the weeks since the china story took its predictable course president clintons decision to renew chinas trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between americas global economic interests and its selfimage as the worlds leading advocate of human rights thomas friedmans lead article opened in the new york times reporting the surprising outcome clinton did not merely endorse the bush administration policies that he had caustically denounced during the presidential campaign but went well beyond them deciding to delink human rights completely from trade privileges2

the indonesia case sheds further light on the titanic clash as discussed in part i clinton joined his predecessors and colleagues abroad in ensuring the welfare of the indonesian tyrants and murderers and the foreign corporations that benefit from their rule blocking and evading congressional restrictions on military assistance the issue was quite narrow whether to refrain from direct participation in indonesian atrocities at home and abroad there was no thought of proceeding beyond to some action to deter some of the worst crimes of the modern era

the review in part i was perhaps unfair in not mentioning that world leaders do recognize some limits and have indeed considered sanctions against indonesia in november 1993 on behalf of the nonaligned movement and the world health organization who indonesia submitted to the un a resolution requesting an opinion from the world court on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons in the face of this atrocity the guardians of international morality leaped into action the us uk and france threatened indonesia with trade sanctions and termination of aid unless it withdrew the resolution as it did traditional clients understand very well when a message from the powerful is to be heeded

citizens of the free world were again fortunate to have the information readily available to them in this case in the catholic church press in canada3

freedom of information can go only so far however on june 10 the world court was scheduled to take up the who request for an opinion despite a furious campaign by the us uk and their allies to prevent this outrage the matter is of some importance even consideration of the issue by the court would be a contribution to the cause of nonproliferation even more so a decision that use of nuclear weapons is a crime under international law  hence by implication possession as well as of midjune i have found no word on the matter though the nonproliferation treaty is a topic of lead headlines particularly the threat posed to its renewal in 1995 by north koreas alleged nuclear weapons program

i barely mentioned one of the clearest tests of the clinton vision on democracy enhancement haiti the case serves well to illustrate the prodemocracy policies of the reaganbush years as carothers accurately describes them we may ask then how things changed as the new democrats took command4

1 the legacy of history

even the briefest glimpse of haitis torment leaves impressions that do not easily fade beginning with the scene of desolation on approaching the international airport it is hard to remember that through the 18th century the island was the richest and most profitable of the western colonies and like todays bangladesh had struck the european conquerors as a virtual paradise the presidential palace in portauprince dominating a large square is flanked by the headquarters of the military command and at a slight remove the equallydreaded police the symbols of authority and violence stand in impudent mockery of the misery that lies below them  confirming the permanence of power a reminder to the people of their smallness in regard to the state a reminder to the executioners of the omnipotence of their chief in the worlds of haitian anthropologist michelrolph trouillot expressing the logic of the duvalierists papa doc and baby doc who ruled with brutal violence for 30 years5

in the markets and slums below it is barely possible to make ones way down alleys of mud and filth through teeming masses of people clad in rags women struggle past with huge burdens on their heads children try to sell any miserable object an occasional cart is dragged through mud that is inches deep and puddles left by recent rains flies swarm over a handful of vegetables and what might pass for fish peasants who have trudged down from the mountains on ancient trails sit by their paltry offerings sleeping in the relics of shacks that line the alleys in the depths of third world poverty one rarely finds a scene so noxious and depressing

when i visited briefly a year ago before the renewed terror some people in the marketplace were willing to speak in the presence of a translator who was known and trusted but only in circumlocution the eyes of the security forces are everywhere they intimated by their gestures more than their words these were uniform hunger no work no hope  unless somehow president aristide returns though few dare to articulate the phrase beyond hints and nods some do with remarkable courage even after police torture and the threat of worse it is not easy to believe that such courage can long survive even if the people do

us relations with haiti are not a thing of yesterday and show no sign of fundamental change they go back 200 years to the days when the republic that had just won its independence from britain joined the imperial powers in their campaign to quell haitis slave rebellion by violence when the rebellion nevertheless succeeded the us exceeded all others in the harshness of its reaction refusing to recognize haiti until 1862 in the context of the american civil war at that moment haiti was important for its strategic location and as a possible dumping ground for freed slaves liberia was recognized in the same year for the same reasons haiti then became a plaything for useuropean power politics with numerous us interventions culminating in woodrow wilsons invasion of haiti and the dominican republic where his warriors  as viciously racist as the administration in washington  murdered and destroyed reinstituted virtual slavery dismantled the constitutional system because the backward haitians could not see the merits of turning their country into a us plantation and established the national guards that held both countries in their grip after the marines finally left

wilsons thuggery has entered history in two different versions here and there in the us the events figure in the amusing reconstructions entitled history as an illustration of us humanitarian intervention and its difficulties for us haitians have somewhat different memories most observers agree that the achievements of the occupation were minor they disagree only as to the amount of damage it inflicted trouillot writes under the heading unhealed sores the damage included the acceleration of haitis economic military and political centralization its economic dependence and sharp class divisions the vicious exploitation of the peasantry the internal racial conflicts much intensified by the extreme racism of the occupying forces and perhaps worst of all the establishment of an army to fight the people the 19151934 us occupation of haiti he writes left the country with two poisoned gifts a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus6

a year ago after enduring almost two years of renewed state violence grassroots organizations priests in hiding tortured labor leaders and others suffering bitterly from the violence of the security forces expressed marked opposition to the plan to dispatch 500 un police to the terrorized country seeing them as a cover for a us intervention that evokes bitter memories of the marine occupation if ever noted such reactions may be attributed to the fact that even a benevolent occupation creates resistanceamong the beneficiaries harvard historian david landes writing about the marine occupation or to the deficiencies of people who need only a new culture and more kind tutelage of the kind he provided as director of the usaid mission in 197779 lawrence harrison writes in a think piece on haitis problems in which the us military occupation merits only the words and some of the marines abused their power7

poor and suffering people do not have the luxury of indulging in fairy tales not uncommonly their own experience gives them a grasp of realities that are well concealed by the intellectual culture the usual victims can not so easily dismiss the record of us power which leaves little doubt that us military intervention in haiti would be the death knell for any form of democracy that risks upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the united states has long been allied haitians who have lost all hope for restoration of democracy might support a military intervention that could perhaps reduce terror and torture but that is the most that can be realistically expected

the military occupation left the island under us control and largely usowned the killer and torturer trujillo took over the dominican republic remaining a great friend until he began to get out of hand in the 1950s in haiti washington reacted with some ambivalence to the murderous and brutal dictatorship of papa doc francois duvalier finding him a bit too independent for its taste nevertheless kennedy provided him with military assistance in line with his general program of establishing firm us control over the hemispheres military and police as they undertook the task of internal security that he assigned them in a historic 1962 decision kennedy also provided aid for the francois duvalier international airport in exchange for the haitian vote to expel cuba from the oas when baby doc jeanclaude took over in 1971 relations rapidly improved and haiti became another darling of the business community along with brazil under the neonazi generals and other rightthinking folk usaid undertook to turn haiti into the taiwan of the caribbean forecasting a historic change toward deeper market interdependence with the united states trouillot observes us taxpayers funded projects to establish assembly plants that would exploit such advantages as enormous unemployment thanks in part to usaid policies emphasizing agroexport and a workforce  mainly women as elsewhere considered more docile  with wages of 14 cents an hour no unions ample terror and the other usual amenities the consequences were profits for us corporations and their haitian associates and a decline of 56 in wages in the 1980s in short if not taiwan exactly haiti was an economic miracle of the usual sort

haiti offered the reaganites yet another opportunity to reveal their understanding of democracy enhancement in june 1985 when its legislature unanimously adopted a new law requiring that every political party must recognize presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier as the supreme arbiter of the nation outlawing the christian democrats and granting the government the right to suspend the rights of any party without reasons the law was ratified by a majority of 9998 washington was deeply impressed as much so as it was when mussolini won 99 of the vote in the march 1934 election leading roosevelts state department to conclude that the results demonstrate incontestably the popularity of the fascist regime and of that admirable italian gentleman who ran it as roosevelt described the dictator these are among the many interesting facts that might be recalled as neofascists now take their place openly in the political system that was reconstructed with their interests in mind as italy was liberated by american forces 50 years ago curiously all this escaped attention during the dday anniversary extravaganza along with much else that is too enlightening

the 1985 steps to enhance democracy in haiti were an encouraging step forward the us ambassador informed his guests at a july 4 celebration the reagan administration certified to congress that democratic development was progressing so that military and economic aid could continue to flow  mainly into the pockets of baby doc and his entourage it also informed congress that the human rights situation was improving as it was at the time in el salvador and guatemala and today in colombia and quite generally when some client regime requires military aid for internal security the house foreign affairs committee controlled by democrats had given its approval in advance calling on reagan to maintain friendly relations with duvaliers noncommunist government

to justify their perception of an encouraging step forward in democratic development the reaganites could have recalled the vote held under woodrow wilsons rule after he had disbanded the haitian parliament in punishment for its refusal to turn haiti over to american corporations under a new usdesigned constitution wilsons marines organized a plebiscite in which the constitution was ratified by a 999 vote with 5 of the population participating using rather high handed methods to get the constitution adopted by the people of haiti the state department conceded a decade later baby doc in contrast allowed a much broader franchise though it is true that he demanded a slightly higher degree of acquiescence than wilsonian idealists mussolini and new dealers a case could be made then that the lessons in democracy that washington had been laboring to impart were finally sinking in

these gratifying developments were shortlived however by december 1985 popular protests were straining the resources of state terror what happened next was described by the wall street journal with engaging frankness after huge demonstrations the white house concluded that the regime was unraveling and that haitis ruling inner circle had lost faith in its favored democrat baby doc as a result us officials including secretary of state george shultz began openly calling for a democratic process in haiti small wonder that shultz is so praised for his commitment to democracy and other noble traits

the meaning of this call for democracy was underscored by the scenario then unfolding in the philippines where the army and elite made it clear they would no longer support another gangster for whom reagan and bush had expressed their admiration even love not long before so that the white house began openly calling for a democratic process there as well both events accordingly enter the canon as a demonstration of how we served as inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time in those wondrous years new republic

washington lent its support to the postduvalier national council of government cng providing 28 million in military aid in its first year while the cng generously helped by the us taxpayers money had openly gunned down more civilians than jeanclaude duvaliers government had done in fifteen years trouillot after a series of coups and massacres reagans ambassador explained to human rights investigators that i dont see any evidence of a policy against human rights there may be violence it is true but it is just part of the culture we can only watch in dismay and incomprehension

haitian violence thus falls into the same category as the atrocities in el salvador at the same time for example the massacre at el mozote one of the many conducted by ustrained elite battalions  and one of the few to be admitted to history after exposure by the un truth commission given their origins in us planning these routine atrocities must also be part of the culture or perhaps there is no one to blame except the gods of war as christopher lehmannhaupt of the new york times observed reviewing the fairminded account by mark danner which aptly denotes the horrifying incident as a central parable of the cold war for which blame is shared equally by salvadorans on all sides murderers and victims alike in contrast atrocities organized and directed by the soviet union always seemed to have more determinable origins for some reason8

2 the democratic interlude

haitis happy ascent towards taiwan was deflected unexpectedly in december 1990 when a real problem arose unlike the terror and virtual enslavement of workers that are just part of the culture washington made a serious error allowing a free election in expectation of an easy victory for its candidate marc bazin a former world bank official to the surprise of outside observers father jeanbertrand aristide was elected with twothirds of the vote bazin was second with 14 backed by a popular movement lavalas which had escaped the notice of the rich folk outside of properly educated circles one question came to the fore at once what would the us and its clients do to remove this cancer

president aristide held office from february to september when his government was overthrown by a military coup plunging the country into even deeper barbarism than before there are two versions of what happened in the interim one is given by various extremists who see aristide as the representative of a remarkably advanced array of grassroots organizations lavalas that gave the large majority of the population a considerable voice in local affairs and even in national politics americas watch and who were impressed by aristides domestic policies as he acted quickly to restore order to the governments finances after taking power when the economy was in an unprecedented state of disintegration interamerican development bank other international lending agencies agreed offering aid and endorsing aristides investment program they were particularly impressed by the steps he took to reduce foreign debt and inflation to raise foreign exchange reserves from near zero to 12 million to increase government revenues with successful tax collection measures reaching into the kleptocracy to streamline the bloated government bureaucracy and eliminate fictitious positions in an anticorruption campaign to cut back contraband trade and improve customs and to establish a responsible fiscal system

these actions were welcomed by the international financial community the iadb noted leading to a substantial increase in assistance atrocities and flight of refugees also virtually ended indeed the refugee flow reversed as haitians began to return to their country in its moment of hope the us embassy in haiti secretly acknowledged the facts in a february 1991 state department cable declassified in 1994 the number two person in the embassy vicky huddleston reported to washington on the surprisingly successful efforts of the aristide governmentquickly reversed after the coup reported by dennis bernstein for pacific news service9

sophisticates in washington and new york could understand that all of this is illusion as secretary of state lansing had explained the experience of liberia and haiti show that the african race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature of course there are many exceptions to this racial weakness but it is true of the mass as we know from experience in this country it is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable

a more acceptable version of aristides months in offices is offered by new york times haiti correspondent howard french he reported after the coup that aristide had governed with the aid of fear leaning heavily on lavalas an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and longexiled leftists whose model was chinas cultural revolution aristides power hunger led to troubles with civil society furthermore haitian political leaders and diplomats say the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by father aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged the coup although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67 of the popular vote in the countrys december 1990 elections father aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the constitution and growing fears of political and classbased violence which many believe the president endorsed10

relation to fact aside the analysis provides some lessons in political correctness twothirds of the population and their organizations fall outside of civil society those involved in the popular organizations and in local and national politics are not among the politically active people it is scandalous to tell the plain truth about the responsibility of the kleptocracy for the poverty of the masses fears of political and classbased violence are limited to the months when such violence sharply declined its traditional perpetrators being unable temporarily to pursue their vocation

these lessons should be remembered as washington moves to construct a civil society and democratic political order for this failed state with its degenerate culture and people quite incapable of governing themselves

in reality the two versions of what happened during the democratic interlude are closer than it may seem on the surface the remarkably advanced array of popular organizations that brought the large majority of the population into the political arena is precisely what frightened washington and the mainstream generally they have a different understanding of democracy and civil society one that offers no place to popular organizations that allow the overwhelming majority a voice in managing their own affairs by definition the political leaders of such popular organizations have only meager democratic credentials and can therefore be granted only symbolic participation in the democratic institutions that we will construct in accord with our traditional prodemocracy policies so the government and media have been instructing us since the coup removed the radical extremist aristide and his maoist clique

these simple truths account for much of what has happened in haiti since aristides election trouillot concludes his study by observing that in haiti the peasantry is the nation but for policymakers the peasantry are worthless objects except insofar as they can advance corporate profits they may produce food for export and enrich local affiliates of us agribusiness or flock to the city to provide supercheap labor for assembly plants but they have no further function it is therefore entirely natural that usaid while providing 100 million in assistance to the private sector should never have provided a penny to the leading popular peasant organization the peasant movement of papaye mpp and that former usaid director harrison should see no special problem when mpp members are massacred by the military forces and should dismiss with contempt its call for moves to reinstitute the popularly elected president who was committed to bottomup rather than topdown democracy

similarly it is hardly surprising that usaid should have denounced the labor reforms aristide sought to institute and opposed his efforts to raise the minimum wage to a princely 37 cents an hour nor should we find it odd that usaid invested massively in the low wage assembly sector while wages sharply declined and working conditions fell to abysmal levels but terminated all efforts to promote investment as the democratically elected government took office rather usaid reacted to this catastrophe by dedicating itself still more firmly to providing the haitian business community with what it called technical assistance in labor relations development of a business oriented public relations campaign and intensified efforts to attract us products assembly operations to haiti given the unfortunate democratic deviation usaids task in its own words was to work to develop sustainable dialogue between the government and the business community no comparable efforts for workers and peasants were needed when haiti was run by usbacked killers and torturers all of this conforms well to usaids conception of processes of democratic institutional reform as those that further economic liberalization objectives11

similarly there is no reason to be surprised that us elites suddenly began to show a sensitive concern for human rights and democracy just as human rights violations precipitously declined and democracy though not in the preferred topdown sense began to flourish amy wilentz observes that during aristides brief term washington suddenly became concerned with human rights and the rule of law in haiti during the four regimes that preceded aristide she writes international humanrights advocates and democratic observers had begged the state department to consider helping the democratic opposition in haiti but no steps were taken by the united states to strengthen anything but the executive and the military until aristide won the presidency then all of a sudden the united states began to think about how it could help those haitians eager to limit the powers of the executive or to replace the government constitutionally the state department democracy enhancement project was specifically designed to fund those sectors of the haitian political spectrum where opposition to the aristide government could be encouraged precisely as prodemocracy policies dictate the institutions and leaders that merited such support are just the ones that survived the military coup also no surprise12

3 after the coup

wilentz reports further that immediately after the september 30 coup the state department apparently circulated a thick notebook filled with alleged human rights violations under aristide  something it had not done under the previous rulers duvalierists and military men who were deemed proper recipients for aid including military aid based on unsubstantiated humanrights improvements toronto star reporter linda diebel adds details a thick bound dossier on aristides alleged crimes was presented by the coup leader general cedras to oas negotiators on october 3 us ambassador alvin adams summoned reporters from the new york times washington post and other major us journals to private meetings where he briefed them on these alleged crimes reportedly presenting them with the dossier  which we may learn some day was compiled by us intelligence and provided to its favorite generals the ambassador and his helpers began leaking the tales that have been used since to demonstrate aristides meager democratic credentials and his psychological disorders13

the approved version is reflected by coverage of human rights abuses after the coup as shown in a study by boston media action while the military were rampaging the press focussed on abuses attributed to aristide supporters less than 1 of the total but the topic of 60 of the coverage in major journals during the two weeks following the coup and over half of coverage in the new york times through mid1992 during the twoweek period after the coup catherine orenstein reports the times spent over three times as many column inches discussing aristides alleged transgressions as it spent reporting on the ongoing military repression mass murders executions and tortures that were reported in human rights publications earned less than 4 of the space that the times devoted to haiti in those weeks a week after the coup the washington post accused aristide of having organized his followers into an instrument of real terror ignoring the 75 reduction in human rights abuses during his term reported by human rights groups14

while attention was directed to the really important topic of the classbased violence of aristide and the popular movements the ustrained military and police were conducting their reign of terror ruthlessly suppressing haitis once diverse and vibrant civil society americas watch reported though washingtons capacity to curb attacks on civil society was tremendous this power was largely unexercised by the bush administration which sought to convey an image of normalcy while forcefully returning refugees the terror is functional it ensures that even if aristide is permitted to return he would have difficulty transforming his personal popularity into the organized support needed to exert civilian authority americas watch observed in early 1993 quoting priests and others who feared that the destruction of the popular social organizations that gave people hope had already undermined the great promise of haitis first democratic experiment15

the coup and ensuing terror revived the flow of refugees that had lapsed under aristide the bush administration ordered the coast guard and navy to force them back or to imprison them in the us military base in guantanamo until a court order terminated the shocking practices there during the presidential campaign clinton bitterly condemned these cruel policies on taking over in january 1993 he at once tightened the noose imposing a still harsher blockade forceful return of refugees continued in violation of international law and human rights conventions clintons increased brutality proved to be a grand success refugee flow which had reached over 30000 in 1992 sharply declined under clintons ministrations to about the level of 1989 before the sharp decline under aristide16

the official story is that these are economic refugees not victims of political persecution who would be eligible for asylum the onset of poverty can be quite precisely dated to the date of the coup during aristides term refugee flow was slight skyrocketing after the coup though economic sanctions were minimal these oddities are noted by the indispensable journal haiti info published in portauprince in a discussion of a cable circulated to high officials by us ambassador william swing the 11page cable full of racist slanders alleges that the haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda tool and is wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort by human rights organizations and the civilian monitors of the un and oas missions all comsymps in the terminology of an earlier day the embassy dismissed with a sneer the reports of the sudden epidemic of rapes on the grounds that for a range of cultural reasons not pleasant to contemplate rape has never been considered or reported as a serious crime here the testimony of a man that his wife was raped and that he was badly beaten under police custody corroborated by a foreign nurse is dismissed because he chose asylum in canada granted at once avoiding the us immigration and naturalization service ins  a transparent admission of iniquity clintons embassy attributes problems in haiti to a high level of structural or endemic violence which again is just part of the culture like the poverty that causes refugee flight the structural factors causing violence had an unexplained 8month gap during aristides tenure even his most vehement opponents the usaidsupported human rights advocates who moved quickly into power after the coup could compile only 25 cases of mob violence and four crimes that could be considered political a tiny fraction of the terror before not to speak of the atrocities that followed the coup

kenneth roth the director of human rights watch comments that the cable reveals the extreme antipathy for aristide in the embassy and its willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for aristides return it reflects a dislike and distrust of aristide that has been widely felt in the administration  though voiced only privately times correspondent elaine sciolino adds in reality the dislike is quite public and widely reported along with the fact that it has sent a very clear message to the haitian rulers military and civilian17

as the embassy cable was released an experienced ins asylum officer in haiti went public with his charges that thousands of egregious cases of persecution were rejected by the haitian ins office where the entire process of asylum review had been politicized and under 1 of legitimate petitions were accepted by racist and contemptuous officials similar accounts have been documented by human rights organizations who have also denounced the very idea that petitioners should have to identify themselves to the murderers by appearing at the ins office at the same time a top secret memo of the us interests section in cuba was leaked addressed to the secretary of state the cia and the ins the document complains about the lack of genuine claims of political persecution in cuba contrary to policy needs the usual silence prevailed18

meanwhile refugees from cuba receive royal treatment while haitians are returned to terror that is nothing new of the more than 24000 haitians intercepted by us forces from 1981 to aristides takeover in 1991 11 were granted asylum as victims of political persecution in comparison with 75000 out of 75000 cubans in these years of terror washington allowed 28 asylum claims during aristides tenure with violence and repression radically reduced 20 were allowed from a refugee pool perhaps 150th the scale practice returned to normal after the military coup and the renewed terror as always human rights are understood in purely instrumental terms as a weapon to be selectively deployed for power interests nothing more

the democratically elected president will be acceptable to washington and elite opinion generally only if he abandons his popular mandate ceding effective power to the moderates in the business world the moderates are those who do not favor slaughter and mutilation preferring to see the population driven to agroexport and the lowwage assembly sector they constitute civil society in the technical sense since the coup the us has demanded that aristide agree to broaden the government in such a way as to place the moderates in power insofar as he refuses to transfer power into these proper hands he is an extremist whom we can hardly support

while these are the basic terms of respectable discourse the spectrum is not entirely uniform it ranges from the far right which is honest and outspoken in its call for dismantling haitian democracy to the more nuanced versions of the liberal democrats taking a stand in the middle george bush calls for abandoning aristide because he has become unreliable and even turned on our president the other day may 1994 aristide should be dumped because his undemocratic behaviorincluded fostering violence against his opponents according to another noted pacifist who has distinguished himself particularly for his dedication to legality and democratic principle elliott abrams

moving toward the liberal end a clinton official explained in the last days of 1993 that were not talking about dumping aristide or about military powersharing but we have two adversaries who dont want to compromise and we have to find enough of a middle to make a functioning democracy marginalizing the extremists on both sides the elected president should be restored to power at least nominally world peace foundation president and historian robert rotberg added but also at most nominally as all understand the washington director of the interamerican dialogue peter hakim urged in may 1994 that the us ought to separate out the notion of protecting human rights and reestablishing some semblance of society in haiti from restoring aristide to power so it is only honest for the united states to tell father aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises as the times editors phrased the common understanding a few weeks later in short the traditional prodemocracy policies19 the basic idea was outlined by secretary of state warren christopher during his confirmation hearings christopher expressed support for father aristide elaine sciolino reported but stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as president there is no question in my mind that because of the election he has to be part of the solution to this mr christopher said i dont have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter20 with this ringing endorsement of democracy the clinton administration took charge

across the spectrum it is taken for granted that we have both the right and the competence to establish some semblance of society in haiti whose people are so retrograde as to have developed a remarkably advanced array of grassroots organizations that gave the majority of the population a place in the public arena plainly they desperately need our tutelage

4 the clinton compromise

to much acclaim washington finally succeeded in compelling aristide to transfer authority to the moderates under severe pressure in july 1993 the haitian president accepted the usun terms for settlement which were to allow him to return four months later in a compromise with the gangsters and killers he agreed to appoint as prime minister a businessman from the traditional mulatto elite robert malval who is known to be opposed to the populist policies during aristides seven months in power the press announced with relief noting that he is generally well regarded by the business community respected by many businessmen who supported the coup that ousted the president and seen as a reassuring choice by coupsupporters

shortly after these happy developments took place unoas observers reported with little notice that they were very concerned that there is no perceptible lessening of human rights violations and a few weeks later reported an increase in arbitrary executions and suspicious deaths in the weeks following the unbrokered accord over one a day in the portauprince area alone the mission said that many of the victims were members of popular organizations and neighborhood associations and that some of the killers were police wire services reported21

expected to be a transitional figure malval resigned at the years end his presence did however serve a useful role for washington and its media diverting attention to a political settlement while attacks on the popular organizations and general terror mounted aristides promised return was blocked and new initiatives were put forth to transfer power to traditional power centers broadening the government malvals presence also offered the press a great method to bring out aristides unreasonable intransigence he couldnt even come to terms with his handpicked prime minister a phrase that ritually accompanied the name robert malval in a typical exercise howard french opened a report of malvals resignation by writing three days after formally resigning the handpicked prime minister of haitis exiled president lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him  hammering home the message in the fashion that became so routine as to be comical malval described aristide as an erratic figure with a serious ego problem french continued referring to his commitment to restore the democraticallyelected government22

as the date for aristides scheduled october 30 return approached atrocities mounted high enough to gain some attention though no action amidst reports of terrifying stories of terror murder and threats to exterminate all members of the popular organizations the clinton administration announced that the un mission will rely on the haitian military and police to maintain order  that is on the killers it is not a peacekeeping role secretary of defense aspin explained we are doing something other than peacekeeping here meanwhile the press emphasized the concerns of us officials that aristide isnt moving strongly to restore democratic rights from his exile in washington even as the situation has grown worse foreign diplomats have increasingly blamed father aristide for what they say is his failure to take constructive initiatives howard french wrote using the standard device to disguise propaganda as reporting23

the stage was set for ignoring the october deadline as the us stood helplessly by unable to bring the uncompromising and violent extremists on both sides to accept democracy

reviewing these mid1993 developments ian martin who directed the oasun mission from april through december 1993 writes that one basic problem was us insistence on adding a mostly american military component to the negotiators proposals aristides call for reducing the haitian army to 1000 men was rejected the haitian high command for its part sought us assistance to ensure the armys future the generals trusted the us and mistrusted the un and the proposal for the canadians and french both more committed supporters of aristide than the united states to take the lead in the police contingent the us hoped to preserve the military  an institution it had often assisted and in fact had created for purposes of internal control during the american occupation of 191534 haitian army resistance was encouraged whenever they perceived that the united states despite its rhetoric of democracy was ambivalent about that power shift to the popular elements represented by aristide there was no shortage of such occasions

the crucial signal martin and others agree came on october 11 when the uss harlan county was scheduled to disembark us and canadian troops at portauprince the military organized a hostile demonstration of armed thugs martin observes and instead of waiting in the harbor while the haitian military was pressured to ensure a safe landing the harlan county turned tail for guantanamo bay leaving officials of the unoas mission aghast they had been neither consulted nor informed of the decision by president bill clintons national security council to retreat the organizers of the haitian protest could hardly believe their success martin continues the leader of the paramilitary organization fraph responsible for much of the terror said that my people kept wanting to run away but i took the gamble and urged them to stay then the americans pulled out we were astonished that was the day fraph was actually born before everyone said we were crazy suicidal that we would all be burned if aristide returned but now we know he is never going to return the military got the message too loud and clear

perhaps they were even notified in advance new york daily news correspondent juan gonzalez learned of the october 11 port demonstration the day before at a duvalierist meeting attended by us embassy personnel the following day he asked in print how can two daily news reporters who have only visited haiti on a few occasions learn beforehand of secret plans to sabotage the landing of our troops while our vaunted officialdom claims it was caught flatfooted how indeed

another possible line of communication is suggested in a report by father antoine adrien former head of aristides religious order in haiti and a close associate just before the ship turned tail he informed the catholic church press that haitian military officers had not only attended training school in fort benning ga in 1992 but that some were there as recently as the previous week  october 1993 how are you going to tell those people they have no backing in the united states father adrien asked that haitian army officers received training in the us after the coup was confirmed in an internal pentagon document including eight officers who started courses in early 1992 the program they joined is designed to expose future leaders of foreign defense establishments to american values regard for human rights and democratic institutions according to the defense secretarys report to the president for 1993 earlier graduates include the leading killers in haiti central america and elsewhere

what lay behind the decision to turn tail was explained by deputy under secretary of defense walter slocombe who boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the uss harlan county he had helped save the united states from a small war the times reported six months later he vowed that the pentagon would not risk american soldiers lives to put that psychopath back in power24

while messages were coming through to the military the haitian people were deprived of the one voice they longed to hear senior clinton administration officials are embroiled in a fight over whether to allowaristide to broadcast into the juntaruled country using airborne us military transmitters paul quinnjudge reported in may 1994 the usia is opposed fearing that the plan may violate international law always a prime concern in washington usia was also concerned that such broadcasts would provide aristide with an uncomfortably direct means to communicate with haitians who elected him by an overwhelming margin in 1990 his oratory has been known to create problems a classifed usia memorandum of may 23 noted asking whether we wish to have the responsibility for having given him the means to broadcast whatever he chooses to haiti he might even challenge the us publicly the first time we refuse to air something it wouldnt even suffice to have him submit his scripts in advance because of the highly nuanced language and context of a radio broadcast who knows what thoughts this devious creature might convey by his tone of voice debate over the ideaunderscores the continuing ambivalence and nervousness with which some senior officials view aristide quinnjudge observed25

after the military coup the oas instituted a toothless embargo which the bush administration reluctantly joined while making clear that it was not to be taken seriously the reasons were explained a year later by howard french washingtons deepseated ambivalence about a leftwardtilting nationalist whose style diplomats say has sometimes been disquietingly erratic precludes any meaningful support for sanctions against the military rulers despite much blood on the armys hands united states diplomats consider it a vital counterweight to father aristide whose classstruggle rhetoricthreatened or antagonized traditional power centers at home and abroad aristides call for punishment of the military leadership that had slaughtered and tortured thousands of people reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader and heightened washingtons antipathy towards the clumsy and erratic extremist who has aroused great anger because of his tendency toward ingratitude26

the vital counterweight is therefore to hold total power while the leftward tilting nationalist remains in exile awaiting the eventual return that bill clinton promised on the eve of his inauguration meanwhile the traditional power centers in haiti and the us will carry on with class struggle as usual employing such terror as may be needed in order for plunder to proceed unhampered and as the london financial times added at the same time washington was proving oddly ineffective in detecting the lucrative use of the country in the transhipment of narcotics by which the military is funding its oil and other necessary imports financing the necessary terror and rapacity  though us forces seem able to find every fishing boat carrying miserable refugees nor had washington figured out a way to freeze the assets of civil society or to hinder their shopping trips to miami and new york or to induce its dominican clients to monitor the border to impede the flow of goods that takes care of the wants of civil society while the embargo remains at best sievelike27

meanwhile washington continued to provide haitian military leaders with intelligence on narcotics trafficking  which they naturally used to expedite their activities and tighten their grip on power it is not easy to intercept narcotraffickers the press explained because haiti has no radar and evidently the us navy and air force lack the means to remedy this deficiency28

under clinton matters only got worse an april 1994 report of human rights watchamericas documents the increasing terror and state department apologetics and evasions condemning the administration for having embraced a murderous armed force as a counterweight to a populist president it distrusts

on february 4 1992 the bush administration lifted the embargo for assembly plants under heavy pressure from american businesses with interests in haiti the washington post reported with its editorial endorsement the lobbying effort was assisted by elliott abrams human rights watch noted for januaryoctober 1992 us trade with haiti came to 265 million according to the department of commerce29

as clinton took over the embargo became still more porous the dominican border was left wide open meanwhile us companies continued to be exempted from the embargo  so as to ease its effects on the population the administration announced with a straight face only exemptions for us firms have this curious feature there were many heartfelt laments about the suffering of poor haitians under the embargo but one had to turn to the underground press in haiti the alternative media here or an occasional letter to learn that the major peasant organization mpp church coalitions labor organizations and the national federation of haitian students continued to call for a real embargo30

curiously some of those most distressed by the impact of the embargo on the haitian poor were the most forceful advocates of a still harsher embargo on cuba notably liberal democrat robert torricelli author of the steppedup embargo that the bush administration accepted under pressure from the clintonites evidently hunger causes no pain to cuban children another oddity that passed unnoticed along with the ushaiti trade figures

clintons tinkering with the embargo also passed without comment here though the facts are known and occasionally even leak through as in a tiny feb 13 reuters dispatch in the new york times reporting efforts of human rights advocates to convince the president to observe the embargo us imports from haiti rose by more than half last year 1993 the financial times reported in london thanks in part to an exemption granted by the us treasury for imports of goods assembled in haiti from us parts us exports to haiti also rose in 1993 exports from haiti to the united states included food fruits and nuts citrus fruit or melons from the starving country which increased by a factor of 35 from januaryjuly 1992 to januaryjuly 1993 the federal government was among the purchasers of the baseballs imported from haiti duty free stitched by women who work 11 hour days with a halfhour break in unbearable heat without running water or a working toilet for 10 cents an hour if they can meet the quota few can using toxic materials without protection so that the us importer can advertise proudly that their softballs are handdipped for maximum bonding the manufacturers are the wealthy haitian families who supported the coup and have gained new riches during the embargo along with others profiting handsomely from the black market such as the fuel supplier for the us embassy the assembly zone loophole criticized by us labor unions and at the un security council by france and canada in january was extended by the clinton administration on april 25 1994 four days after announcing that it would seek to tighten un sanctions the latter announcement was reported on the same day the us coast guard returned 98 refugees to military authorities 18 of them at once arrested

the clinton administration still formally declares its support for mr aristide but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military the financial times reported while european diplomats in washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the uss abdication of leadership over haiti31

in his january 1994 testimony to congress on threats to the us and its interests abroad the director of the cia predicted that haiti probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact and any indication of an imminent exodus the threats to the us were contained with the usual selectivity and skill exodus from the charnel house was effectively blocked while the press reported an oil boom as diplomats expressed amazement at the extent of the trafficking organized by the haitian and dominican armies and the former assured reporters that the military is not concerned about fuel shortages it has plenty32

the clinton administration has scarcely departed from the prescriptions outlined by the washington post and new york times as it came into office33 the preferred solution john goshko explained in the post would delay indefinitely the return to haiti of the radical priest with antiamerican leanings whose strident populism led the haitian armed forces to seize power and would allow bazin or some other prime minister to govern in his place bazin was then prime minister under army rule but was having problems because although wellknown and wellregarded in the united states unfortunately the masses in haiti consider him a front man for military and business interests a replacement would therefore be needed to represent the interests of the moderates in the times howard french indicated the scale of the required delay in the past diplomats have said the haitian president could return only after a substantial interim period during which the countrys economy was revived and all its institutions from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education were stabilized that should overcome the danger of aristides personalist and electoralist politics but unfortunately the troublesome priest has been recalcitrant father aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return undermining the moderate course

as understood on all sides the delay need not be too long aristides term ends in 1996 and he is barred from running again by then military terror should have sufficiently intimidated the population and demolished popular organizations so that free elections can be tolerated as in the central american terror states without too much fear of any threat to civil society from the rabble

5 the may 1994 reversal

plans proceeded on course into early 1994 by then the cynicism and brutality of us policy had become too blatant for the usual coverup particularly after clintons point man lawrence pezzullo revealed in congressional testimony that the plan that the administration had touted as the product of negotiations among haitian democrats denouncing aristide for his intransigence in rejecting it it made no provision for his return had in fact been produced by the state department which brought to washington selected haitians to ratify it among them duvalierist collaborators of the murderous police chief col francois something new was needed

pezzullo was replaced by william gray a more credible voice in may clinton instituted a new and more humane refugee policy which will mean the forcible return of 95 percent of boat people instead of 100 percent a human rights watch haiti analyst observed pointing out that the us policy excludes people who are not high profile but are persecuted nonetheless the new policy is just window dressing the national refugee coordinator of amnesty international added

but 5 of the boat people fleeing persecution is beyond what the united states can be expected to handle it will devastate florida a republican congressional staff member complained explaining a few days later why the us might have to invade mr clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as the continuous possibility that haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a massive outflow and seek refuge in the united states the times reported the terms poor and desperate convey the doctrine that these are economic refugees overcrowded and destitute the united states plainly cannot bear the burden of accepting refugees or even housing them until their claims of persecution are rejected and surely it has no historical responsibilities in the matter the president piteously pleaded with other countries to help us in our plight34

curiously the anguished debate over this issue missed the obvious candidate tanzania which had just then accommodated hundreds of thousands of rwandans and could surely come to the rescue of the beleaguered united states by accepting a few thousand more black faces

on may 21 an embargo was announced which for the first time may have some serious intent the assembly plant exemption was quietly removed and the dominican border was at least briefly closed the longknown involvement of the haitian military in narcotrafficking was also officially reported were not going to say let the masses and the middle class suffer but the very wealthy dont have to pay a price a senior administration official stated even wealthy haitians starting to feel pinched a times headline read again letting out the real story of the efforts to restore democracy during the 2 12 years since the coup government statements and press reports tacitly conceded what had always been clear that the us has the means far short of military intervention to restore democracy in haiti but had no intention of doing so and still does not what has always been required is a clear declaration of intent to restore democracy but that cannot be given because there is no such intent the military and their civilian allies understand that perfectly well

in the following weeks the us banned commercial air flights and financial transactions while leaving crucial loopholes open personal assets of the coup supporters were not frozen so they can withdraw funds from us bank accounts at will and transfer money to banks abroad administration officials acknowledged  a matter that may be academic the chair of the congressional black caucus kweisi mfume observed since the dictators of haiti have long ago moved their assets in anticipation of this the sanctions also permit the families that have long dominated the economy to hold on to the monopoly of the food trade that is a major source of their wealth including the mevs family which is building a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo french reported adding that washingtons hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests if not fear of a spate of embarrassing revelations made by haitians in reprisal for a crackdown

after sanctions were finally imposed in may 1994 a us diplomat conceded that the continuing failure to move against the richest families has left a perception out there of sending mixed messages and having double agendas other diplomats and haitian experts agree that the decision not to target key civilian supporters of the coup is yet another mixed signal noting particularly the relief granted the mev brandt acra and madsen families who still have a role to play a us embassy source informed the press though they have made no effort to disguise their support for the coup washington is imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and are in business with the military in keeping aristide out that they are free to lead their privileged lives another diplomat said haitian senators who lead the antiaristide movement were not denied their permanent us resident status including bernard sansaricq who played a leading role in installing the puppet civilian government with its new president emile jonassaint appointed to replace aristide35

meanwhile the serious work of undermining the basis for democracy continues unhampered by the time clinton took office as americas watch reported the terror had already decimated the popular organizations that would allow aristide to exert civilian authority even if he were eventually permitted to return as clinton finally agreed to sanctions 16 months later douglas farah reported in the washington post that the army and its allies have damaged democratic institutions and grassroots organizations that had begun to grow in haiti to such an extent that they would take years to rebuild even if haitis military leaders surrendered power according to diplomats and human rights monitors the duvalierist system will continue with or without the return of aristide the leader of a nowclandestine proaristide group said a judgment endorsed by a veteran human rights worker who prefers anonymity because of numerous threats against his life the duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country he said people are losing their ability to make things happen here and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances even nonpolitical community organizations have been repressed thousands of community leaders have been driven into hiding along with hundreds of thousands of others while over 4000 have been murdered outright the massive terrorism farah reports is aimed at dismantling the last vestiges of organized support for aristide while the civilian allies of the army and police in fraph have become a very efficient machine of repression which will remain the only authority even if aristide were to return the same human rights worker comments members of the popular organizations interviewed in hiding have applied for political asylum at the us embassy and been denied36

to ensure a smooth transition to the intended postcoup system with the moderates in charge and the duvalierists preserving order fraph and usaidfunded groups linked to it are establishing a monopoly of social services so that the poor who are compliant and docile get health services a haitian doctor explains this is the soft side of counterinsurgency on the model of guatemala and other terror states meanwhile we are to ponder the question of whether haitians can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy howard french or whether we must labor for decades in a perhaps vain effort to overcome the defects  cultural if not genetic  that had been discerned by wilsons secretary of state and carters usaid director in haiti37

as the bush administration prepared to hand over the reins a senior un official observed that its dislike of aristide was an open secret two lines about haiti coexisted at the time there was the line about return to democracy which was for public consumption and then there was a second line spoken privately within the administration and the haitian military knew it perfectly well a year later after the harlan county affair gave birth to fraph a french military adviser updated the picture do you know what the real problem is the americans dont want aristide back and they want the rest of us out  the rest of us being canada france and venezuela the other three of aristides socalled four friends38

that this judgment is exactly right has been apparent throughout it should be clear however that the issue is not aristide personally the problem is the forces he represents the lively and vibrant popular movements that swept him into office greatly alarming the rich and powerful in haiti and their american counterparts and teaching lessons in democracy that have to be silenced for who can tell what minds they might reach
