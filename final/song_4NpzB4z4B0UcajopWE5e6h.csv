the time on the clock reads halfpast four
im wide awake and thinking with my pillow on the floor
that maybe im just wasting my time dreaming in a harsh reality
i dont wanna wake up just to find ive been deceived

chorus
let it roll
our time is fleeting so we take control
from california to my homesweethome
our days repeating like its all we know
its all we know

verse 2
out here the hills roll on for miles
the sun is like my own sense of direction
im always drawn to each horizon
when its rising when it sets
but all i can think about is sex
and playing one more game of sixcup
in the backyard at the wedge
i know ill never die alone because of all of you

chorus
let it roll
our time is fleeting so we take control
from california to my homesweethome
our days repeating like its all we know
its all we know
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likebridge
take take a breath
weve got all the time in the world
to get a grip on the fact that we dont last
but right now i want to watch the tide roll in
with my best friends

chorus
let it roll
our time is fleeting so we take control
from californiaâ€”
let it roll
our time is fleeting so we take control
from california to my homesweethome
let it roll its all we know
its all we know2embed"
