high high up on you
you display you display good traits though few
we found we found time alone will tell
this disease this disease keeps holding me down

verse 2
try to run try to run when near sleep
to imagine to imagine us away
he said come he said come fly around my hell
and know this and know this you seem to be

prechorus
too scared to run
too scared to run too scared to run
too scared to run too scared

chorus
wish i had your faults
nothing seems to phase you
lies
youre much more than just human

verse 3
i was high up on you
til the shadows began to crawl
some say some say we can never know
just how far down just how far down this beast has come
