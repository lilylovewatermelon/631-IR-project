verse 1
picture me rolling
out in the open baby i know
that you would notice
you have been hoping i wouldnt go

hook 1
should i be waiting
should i be waiting for you
dont keep me wading
i will turn blue

verse 2
picture me rolling
out in the open with some other man i know
thought you would notice
and you were hoping feelings wouldnt start to grow

hook 2
while i was wading while i was wading
wading for you
i have been wading i will be wading
till i turn blue

ill have more regret youre something i cannot miss

hook 3
i will be wading i will be wading
for you
i will be wading i will be wading
till i turn blue

verse 3
i am not perfect
i would never let you think i was more than this
as good as it gets
ill have one regret youre something i cannot miss

hook 3
i will be wading i will be wading
wading for you
i will be wading i will be wading
till i turn blue

and i will do it i’ll do it
i’ll prove it i’ve proved it
i’ve proven my love
baby don’t do it don’t do it
don’t ruin what you in
and you did my love
and i will do it i’ll do it
i’ll prove it i’ve proved it
i’ve proven my love
baby don’t do it don’t do it
don’t ruin what you in
and you did my love60embed"
