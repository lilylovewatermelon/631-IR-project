pay attention my love cause its over
at the tip of my tongue is the price you werent willing to pay
still this is something akin to a breakdown
and your impression of a woman supposed to be easy to see

chorus
that thered be torn up photos and lonely nights
cursing crying and drawn out fights
make up sex and a brand new start
broken promises for broken hearts

verse 2
when you look back now was it special
or was it nothing but an anecdote that you can tell now and then
and i delude myself it was worth it
mm even though from the beginning i could see exactly how it would end

chorus
that thered be torn up photos and lonely nights
cursing crying and drawn out fights
make up sex and a brand new start
broken promises for broken hearts
torn up photos and lonely nights
cursing crying and drawn out fights
make up sex and a brand new start
broken promises for broken hearts

i wanna wish you away wanna wish you away
wanna wish you away wanna wish you away
wanna wish you away wanna wish you away
wanna wish you away i wanna wish you away
wanna wish you away wanna wish you away
wanna wish you away i wanna kiss you away

chorus
torn up photos and lonely nights
cursing crying and drawn out fights
make up sex and a brand new start
broken promises for broken heartsembed"
