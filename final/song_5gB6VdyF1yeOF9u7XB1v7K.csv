i didnt call you up and tell you
girl im sorry with whiskey on my breath
i didnt ask you to forgive me
cause girl i know you havent yet

i didnt midnight knock your front door
catch you scared to be alone
i didnt wake up with an empty bottle baby
just kinda woke up on my own

didnt open up my eyes because you said goodbye baby
just kinda woke up on my own

verse 3
i didnt find strength in a stranger i didnt go to bed all stoned
and i didnt come to see the light this morning baby
just kinda woke up on my own
i didnt come to see the light this morning baby
just kinda woke up on my ownyou might also likeembed"
