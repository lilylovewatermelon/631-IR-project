twist around the lounge
sun drowns the house
stick another pill in my head and go to bed
were not doing it again so leave it

chorus
i didnt even see you when i liked you
now i aint got no time
girl i wanna see you undo it
i wanna see you but youre not mine

verse 2
bombs have run out
call round the town
i could hear you giving her head she said
you think were doing it again keep dreaming

chorus
i didnt even see you when i liked you
now i aint got no time
girl i wanna see you undo it
i wanna see you but youre not mine
i didnt even see you when i liked you
now i aint got no time
girl i wanna see you undo it
i wanna see you but youre not mine
i didnt even see you when i liked you
now i aint got no time
girl i wanna see you undo it
i wanna see you but youre not mine
i didnt even see you when i liked you
now i aint got no time
girl i wanna see you undo it
i wanna see you but youre not minesee the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also like33embed"
