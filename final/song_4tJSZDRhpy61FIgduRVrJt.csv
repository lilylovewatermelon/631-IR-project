whos the boy you like the most
is he teasing you with underage
could he be waving from a tropical sunset
static silhouette somehow
single in his bed someday
quiet til it falls falls falls

chorus
rome rome rome rome
focus looking forward the colosseum
oh no what did i say what can i say
rome rome many tears have fallen here
ill be driving you look the other way

verse 2
that aint easy to ignore
when your shutters are open all the way
when its candlelight i see i go insane
distant silhouette somehow
we shared a cigarette somewhere
addict til it falls falls falls

chorus
rome rome rome rome
focus looking forward the colosseum
oh no what did i say what can i say
rome rome many tears have fallen here
ill be driving you look the other way

verse 3
always and forevermore
i call to say im on the way
twothousand years remain in a trash can
that burned a cigarette somewhere
ashes til it fall fall falls

verse 4
i stand outside under broken leaves
i know i cant do without
the futures trying to wait
ive never loved you and if i loved you
i wouldnt say that im sorry oh no
i stand outside under broken leaves

verse 5
always and forevermore
were together dead and lonely
i thought i couldnt do this without you
single in his bed somewhere
ashes til it falls falls falls
