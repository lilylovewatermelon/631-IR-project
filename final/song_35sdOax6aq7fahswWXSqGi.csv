you know ill always be your cowboy but i cant be nobodys fool
so while youre puttin on your makeup ill be puttin on my boots
and im going to saddle up my chevy ride off into the setting sun
and at night while youre not sleepin youre going to wonder where ive gone

chorus
ill be down in tulsa texas tallahassee tennessee
memphis mississippi its probably where im gonna be
albuquerque alabama st lou louisiana
if you want to find me you can find me in tulsa texas

verse 2
ive spent a lot of long and lonely nights waitin for you from the front porch steps
so goodbye my pretty blue eyes you got all of me youre gonna get
and you might not know it but someday this ol boy is going to cross your mind
but dont you worry bout it babe i wont be all that hard to find

chorus
ill be down in tulsa texas tallahassee tennessee
memphis mississippi its probably where im gonna be
albuquerque alabama st lou louisiana
if you want to find me you can find me in tulsa texas
