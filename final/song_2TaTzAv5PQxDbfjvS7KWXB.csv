to the top of all the world
to the tasteless underworld
to the center of your heart
oh cleopatra is the only one you loved
to the demonstrated smile
to the lonely love child
destination desolation
tell me when you reach the brink of life
just a picture on your wall
thats nice what a metaphoric fall

prechorus dan reynolds brittany tolman  both
typically i was a validation on your sleeve
oh what an indication
to the center of the pain
through the tattered window pane
to the middle of your heart

chorus dan reynolds brittany tolman  both
resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
love is clueless and destiny is wishin
this is my heart its on the line selene

verse 2 dan reynolds brittany tolman  both

this is not what i expect
