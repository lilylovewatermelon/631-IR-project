i can see it its funny man
‘cause this life is not going nowhere
and you gon see it
wherever theres struggle knahmean
once in a while i could look at you
i see my pain in yo eyes man
so i know you feeling me
and see the twinkle in your eyes
its that twinkle man
that sign of struggle ive seen it in me

verse 1
‘cause everyday i cant help but see it
that people aint satisfied
and youre hating your 9 to 5
and erybody wanna live another life
but aint no length you go or mountain you climb
not to better your days
but all that would do is leave room for people to say
i guess youre living better now
share a little of that cheddar now
‘cause i remember days back when
a brother was hustling and robbing too
i done tossed the beretta now
on a whole another level now
still i cant enjoy my fame
unless my people doing the same and get money too
