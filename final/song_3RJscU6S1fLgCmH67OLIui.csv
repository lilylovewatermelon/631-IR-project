lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo listen up yall
akoy may daladalang balita galing sa bayan ko listen closely yall
nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuwento
ang mga pangyayaring nagaganap sa lupang pinangako

interlude 1
yo every place got a ghetto
this is my version of it check it out

verse 1
listen closely yo i got a story to tell
a version of my ghetto where life felt for real
some would call it hell but to me it was heaven
god gave me the grace amazing ways of living
how would you feel if you had to catch your meal
build a hut to live and to eat and chill in
having to pump the water outta the ground outta the ground
the way we put it down utilizing what is around
like land for farming river for fishing
everyone helping each other whenever they can
we making it happen from nothing to something
thats how we be surviving back in my homeland

interlude 2
yo its been a while but
ive been back home to my homeland check it out
to see whats going on

verse 2
man it feels good to be back at home
and its been a decade on the journey all alone
i was fourteen when i first left philippines
ive been away half my life but it felt like a day
to be next to my mom with her homecooked meal
man i felt complete my emotions i feel
now life has changed for me in the us
but back at home man life was a mess
i guess sometimes lifes stresses gets you down
on your knees oh brother i wish i could have helped you out
