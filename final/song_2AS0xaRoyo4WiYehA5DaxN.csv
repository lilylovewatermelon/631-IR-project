mmm oh
mmm
yo

verse 1
maybe you died cause everybody ask me where you at
i tried to channel you in hopes that i could steer you back
but its like every intersection we just missed each other
you got your fans waitin tell me you aint six feet under
and tell me that you comin back and you just took a break
maybe i blamed you for everything that was my mistake
in hindsight i loved your rawness and i loved your edge
cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge
your earings bamboo your long nails too
your bmw every time you came through
you was the brave heart you stole wayne heart
you never switched it up you played the same part
but i needed to grow and i needed to know
were there some things inside of me that i needed to show
so i just deaded you left you in all black
but dear old nicki please call back

chorus
you told me youd come when i needed you
and you said it so sweetly i believed you
but im standing here calling i cant see you
but i am holdin you holdin you holdin you
to that

yo did i chase the glitz and glamour money fame and power
cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
i shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards
they was no match for you couldnt defeat your prowess
i had to make them changes i hope you understood
you see for every bad i did a ton of good
but you was underground and i was mainstream
i live the life now that we would daydream
my only wish is you come enjoy it with me
get on them conference calls go meet the lawyers with me
the money came yeah i tripled and quadrupled it
but i still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
and its still fuck the media
they ridiculed you never believed in ya
they just deaded you left you in all black
but dear old nicki please call back

chorus
you told me youd come when i needed you
and you said it so sweetly i believed you
but im standing here calling i cant see you
but i am holdin you holdin you holdin you
to that
