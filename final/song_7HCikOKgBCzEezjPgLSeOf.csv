wont you give me something i need
wont you peel me off of the street
go and wet my tongue
spit me up and break me a fever
give me something i can believe in
give me something to walk me away
im a waste of time
and all in all waste of a living
waste of a living
cant you see me walking alone
ive been down to the horns and back
and im way too tired
of blowing out the burning candles

chorus
i got no money but i want you so x2
i got so much i cannot handle
cannot handle
i cannot handle

verse 2
and all this pissing around
cut loose in this fucking town
i aint coming back
i got my ticket on to the next one
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also like
chorus
i got no money but i want you so x2
and i want x3
and i want itembed"
