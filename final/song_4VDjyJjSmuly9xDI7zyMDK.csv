couldnt have ever dawned on me
all the things that i would be i
i never really looked out quite that far
its never been a simple thing
to see the world with a young mans brain with
an old mans heart and restless soul

verse 2
yeah my family went broke in my eighteenth year
dad took a job many miles from here that
that was alright by me i was on my own
i had a band found a job and life was alright
i worked when i had to we played all the time
only got through that first year of college alright

chorus
but i learned more on the freight docks
drivin forklifts on the three oclock am shift
in the winter time man it got cold
sellin guitars on the west coast
goin hungry chasin ghosts around
and around we would go
and i saw it all tendin bar at night
treatin saints and sinners right
is a good thing to do all the time
you never know who youre talkin to
but always know whos watchin you
keep your feet movin straight down the line

im somewhere in the middle and thats just fine
no i dont give a damn how much money you make
if your last shirt has pockets take all you can take im
well im goin out with nothin like i came in

chorus
cause i learned more on the freight docks
drivin forklifts on the three oclock am shift
in the winter time man it got cold
sellin guitars on the west coast
goin hungry chasin ghosts around
and around we would go
and i saw it all tendin bar at night
treatin saints and sinners right
is a good thing to do all the time
you never know who youre talkin to
but always know whos watchin you
keep your feet movin straight down the line

chorus
but i learned more on the freight docks
drivin forklifts on the three oclock am shift
in the winter time man it got cold
sellin guitars on the west coast
goin hungry chasin ghosts around
and around we would go
and i saw it all tendin bar at night
treatin saints and sinners right
is a good thing to do all the time
you never know who youre talkin to
