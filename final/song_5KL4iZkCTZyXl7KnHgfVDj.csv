i dont want bruise your ears
or hurt you again
but i got backstabbed by a black cab
when i needed a friend

verse 1
now im in town break it down thinkin of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
and i cant no i wont hush
ill say the words that make you blush
im gonna sing this now oh oh
see im true my songs are where my heart is
im like glue i stick to other artists
im not you now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see im real i do it all its all me
im not fake dont ever call me lazy
i wont stay put give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

chorus
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me

i sing and write my own tune and i write my own verse hell
dont need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
call yourself a singerwriter youre just bluffin
names on the credits and you didnt write nothin
i sing fast i know that all my shits cool
i will blast and i didnt go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i cant last if im smokin on a crack pipe
and i wont be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia
and musically im demonstratin
when i perform live feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young singerwriter like a gabriella cilmi

chorus
cause you need me man i don’t need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me
verse 3
cause with the lyrics ill be aimin it right
i wont stop till my names in lights at stadium heights with damien rice
on red carpets now im on arabian nights
because im young i know my brothers gonna give me advice
long nighter short height and id gone hyper
never be anything but a singersongwriter yeah
the games over but now im on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal
people think that im bound to blow up
ive done around about a thousand shows but
i havent got a house plus i live on a couch
so you believe the lyrics when im singin them out
wow from day one ive been prepared
with v05 wax for my ginger hair
so now im back to the sofa
givin a dose of what the future holds cause its another day
plus ill keep my last name forever keep this genre pretty basic
gonna be breakin into other peoples tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
slipping into another rappers shoes usin new laces
im sellin cds from my rucksack aimin for the papers
sellin cds from my rucksack aimin for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
im still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
im still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
im always doin shows if im not im in the studio
truly broke never growin up call me rufio
melody music maker readin all the papers
they say im up and comin like im fucking in an elevator
chorus
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you46embed"
