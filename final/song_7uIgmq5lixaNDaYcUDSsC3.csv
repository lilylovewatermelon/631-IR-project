mello made it right

chorus
i need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin
i feel like i been through so much i dont even feel nothin
and i know sometimes it might be hard for you to love me
and even though i may not show it i need it from you

verse 1
i thought that i was back on track but i feel lost again
you gotta learn to trust yourself these people not your friends
where would they be if i was down at sticks and rocks again
they only love me cause im countin up these knots with them
i know im just guap to them
i seen money change my friends i seen money change these hoes
i see motherfuckers change cause of the shit that i got on
its like ive been seein the real ever since i got on
and since i stopped doin favors i been in the wrong

chorus
i need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin
i feel like i been through so much i dont even feel nothin
and i know sometimes it might be hard for you to love me
and even though i may not show it i need it from you

verse 2
oh woah here i go tryna fight myself again
its late as fuck im thinkin like how did i get here again
found myself in tears again with everythin that i ever feared
i promised that i wouldnt lose myself but damn it here i am
im in my head constantly and like right now i need you right here
im in my bed prayin up to the sky hopin that god can hear
this shit aint fair now that i got bread im posed to be happy yeah
that should be cool but nothin is
