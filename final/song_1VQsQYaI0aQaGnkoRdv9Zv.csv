what do you when you feel done
where do you go when you dont belong
what do you say when there aint no one
who do you pray to when your faith is gone

chorus
im on a highway run
runnin straight into the black hole sun
gonna burn right through
the rights and wrongs the ashes too
of the past that lives in my rearview
im on a highway run
back to you

verse 2
when you dont feel at home in your own skin
when god alone knows where your soul has been
what does it take to wash away the sin
what do you with what youve done

chorus
im on a highway run
runnin straight into the black hole sun
gonna burn right through
the rights and wrongs the ashes too
of the past that lives in my rearview
im on a highway run
back to you oh
back to you
