verse 1
im wide awake
yeah i was in the dark
i was falling hard with an open heart
im wide awake
how did i read the stars so wrong
im wide awake
and now its clear to me
that everything you see aint always what it seems
im wide awake
yeah i was dreaming for so long

prechorus
i wish i knew then what i know now
wouldnt dive in wouldnt bow down
gravity hurts you made it so sweet
til i woke up on on the concrete

chorus
fallin from cloud nine
crashin from the high
im letting go tonight
yeah im fallin from cloud nine
