ahh yeah

verse 1
theres some days that i wake up cant remember where i am
said some things regret some things but i really dont give a damn
somewhere on this road im on i forgot what its like to feel
i know i cant see heaven up there but i know that its real
and i aint sure if ill get in but you best believe im tryin
and this is what my daddy told me and thats how i live my life

chorus
got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
and always own up to your own mistakes
and dont you ever back down no way no how
got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
yeah thats what he did

verse 2
i cant heal the broken hearts i left so far behind
on this road that i have chose i lost all sense of time
so i drift into the night tryna drown away my sorrows
it might be wrong but thats alright cause all the time is borrowed anyways

chorus
got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
and always own up to your own mistakes
and dont you ever back down no way no how
got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south

but thats okay
think what you want say what you will
but ive always kept it real
theres a cost for all these sins and im bound to pay the price
now this is what my daddy told me and thats how i live my life

chorus
got to take that ball cap off son before you say grace
and always own up to your own mistakes
and dont you ever back down no way no how
got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
a man of the south
