i used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
scared to rock the boat and make a mess
so i sat quietly agreed politely
i guess that i forgot i had a choice
i let you push me past the breaking point
i stood for nothing so i fell for everything

prechorus
you held me down but i got up hey
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice you hear that sound
like thunder gonna shake the ground
you held me down but i got up hey
get ready cause ive had enough
i see it all i see it now
chorus
i got the eye of the tiger a fighter
dancing through the fire
cause i am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar
louder louder than a lion
cause i am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar

postchorus

ohohohohohohoh
ohohohohohohoh
youre gonna hear me roar
