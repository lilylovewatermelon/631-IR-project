i just need some time im tryna think straight
i just need a moment in my own space
ask me how im doin i say okay yeah
but aint that what we all say
sometimes i think back to the old days
in the pointless conversations with the old me
yeah back when my momma used to hold me
i wish somebody woulda told me

chorus
if you want love you gon have to go through the pain
if you want love you gon have to learn how to change
if you want trust you gon have to give some away
if you want love if you want love

verse 2
yeah as a kid i used to think life
is moving so slow i watch it go by
look out the window on my bus ride
i thought the world was so small through my closed eyes
ive always tried to control things
in the end thats what controls me
maybe thats why im controllin
i wish somebody woulda told me

verse 3
the older i get i feel like im always tryna save time
talkin to the voices in my head they make me think twice
tellin me it doesnt mean its wrong because it feels right
im scared that one day ill wake up and wonder whered the time go
talk about the past like its the present while i rock slow
ill sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
and tell em

chorus
if you want love you gon have to go through the pain
i wish you woulda told me
if you want love you gon have to learn how to change
i wish somebody woulda told me
if you want trust you gon have to give some away
you gon have to give
if you want love if you want love
if you want love if you want love140embed"
