wondering what ill do if i have to stay
wanted to leave when she walked right up on me

hey there son why dont we go for a ride
i gotta a car and got nothing to hide
i payed the bill just give me a thrill
uhum

and now my oh my now im far from my alley
riding along in this pinewood rally
but in the way to the lake everything is ok
with a wild wild woman

she said i have a house on the hill
and i soon understood
she didnt take me there to chaperone
she turned on the radio and then she turned me on

i give her away my own town
i could  my city
cause this mean woman is so down on pretty
she is taking a guy like me right out in the world

and now my oh my now im far from my alley
riding along in this pinewood rally
but in the way to the lake everything is ok
with a wild wild womanyou might also likeembed"
