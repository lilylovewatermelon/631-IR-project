i remember trying not to stare the night that i first met you
you had me mesmerized
and three weeks later in the front porch light taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
i hadn’t told you yet but i thought i loved you then

chorus
and now you’re my whole life now you’re my whole world
and i just can’t believe the way i feel about you girl
like a river meets the sea stronger than its ever been
we’ve come so far since that day and i thought i loved you then

verse 2
and i remember taking you back to right where i first met you
you were so surprised
there were people around but i didn’t care i got down on one knee right there
and once again i thought i loved you then

chorus
but now you’re my whole life now you’re my whole world
i just can’t believe the way i feel about you girl
like a river meets the sea stronger than it’s ever been
we’ve come so far since that day and i thought i loved you then

bridge
i can just see you with a baby on the way
i can just see you when your hair is turning grey
what i can’t see is how im ever gonna love you more
but i’ve said that before
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeoutro
and now you’re my whole life now you’re my whole world
i just can’t believe the way i feel about you girl
we’ll look back someday at this moment that we’re in
and i’ll look at you and say and i thought i loved you then
and i thought i loved you thenembed"
