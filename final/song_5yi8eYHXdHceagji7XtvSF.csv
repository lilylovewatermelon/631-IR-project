went walkin through town just the other day with nothin much to do
as the sun came breakin down through the clouds
ive never seen the sky so blue
i saw a cajun man with a red guitar singin on the side of the street
i threw a handful of change in his beat up case and said play me a country beat
and it sounded like

verse 2
met up with some friends outside of town we were headed towards the lake
i hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep and felt the wind upon my face
we got to the spot and the sun was hot everybody was feelin fine
so we jumped on in for a midday swim and then we lost all track of time

chorus
it was the perfect day
what id give if i could find a way to stay
lost in this moment now
aint worried bout tomorrow
when youre busy livin in a perfect day

verse 2
as the moon came out and the fire burned everybody was singin along
to some ramblin man a little curtis loew and all them feel good songs
we danced all night without a care no place wed rather be
cause these are the days well talk about when we lived so wild and free
see lady a liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likechorus
it was the perfect day
what id give if i could find a way to stay
lost in this moment now
aint worried bout tomorrow
when youre busy livin in a perfect day

bridge
we were sittin in the sand as he grabbed my hand and he leaned in for a kiss
i couldnt help but think with the stars above it dont get much better than this

chorus
it was the perfect day
what id give if i could find a way to stay
lost in this moment now
aint worried bout tomorrow
when youre busy livin feels like dreamin
slowly driftin through this perfect day
