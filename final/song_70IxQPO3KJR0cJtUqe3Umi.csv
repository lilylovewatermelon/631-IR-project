starting out a road carefully unload
openeyed and all the light is falling
back and forth and i concede of course
maybe i am in the way recalling

chorus
its just you

verse 2
off again we go another seed to sow
another part to keep in proper order
what have i begun a getaway undone
i have seen the signs and i ignored them

chorus
now its you and me
divine a circular design
do dodo dodo
time and place in mind
points along a line
do dodo dodo

verse 3
sitting in the park i carefully remark
everything is better when youre learning
you were in the dark i was in the dark
everything is made to keep on turning

its just you and me
divine a circular design
do dodo dodo
time and place in mind
points along a line
do dodo dodo
you and me return to be
in orbit all the time

outro
you turn away and around
ive been coming down ive been coming down
you turn away and around
ive been coming down ive been coming down
you and me divine a circular design
you turn away and around
ive been coming down ive been coming down
time and place in mind points along a line
you turn away and around
ive been coming down ive been coming down5embed"
