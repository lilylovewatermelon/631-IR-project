verse 3 twista
i confess about the incident when i was with a shorty in the lexus coupe
your homie said she saw me but she didnt have proof
but i knew i really shouldve been just telling you the truth
and i confess about the days
i was rolling my seville with the custom gold grill
i was in the field still looking for a thrill
and i knew it was bogus i shouldve kept it real wooooaah
and i confess that just when i thought i could really try to get away
or have another woman on the side
but i never knew that it would catch up with a nigga one day
you gotta hear me girl i done learned a lesson
if you stay with me then itll be a blessing
no stressing itll never be no guessing
cause im pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

this by far is the hardest thing i think ive ever had to do yeah

and hopefully youll give me another chance she might go2embed"
