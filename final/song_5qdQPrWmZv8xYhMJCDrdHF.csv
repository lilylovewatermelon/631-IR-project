same old dive
same old endoftheworkweek drink
bartender knows my name but i dont mind
she kicks em up strong serves me up right

chorus
and here i go again im drinkin one im drinkin two
i got my heartache medication a strong dedication
to gettin over you turnin me loose
on that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
my heartache medication well it suits me fine
and im drinkin enough to take you off my mind
i got my heartache medication

verse 2
another girl
another dance to a country song
turnin me on
heres to a good time and halfway to feelin alright

chorus
and here i go again im drinkin one im drinkin two
i got my heartache medication a strong dedication
to gettin over you turnin me loose
on that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
my heartache medication well it suits me fine
and im drinkin enough to take you off my mind
i got my heartache medication
