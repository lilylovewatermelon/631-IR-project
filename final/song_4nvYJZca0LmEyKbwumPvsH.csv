and by the way you know that hope will make you strange
make you blink make you blank make you sink
it will make you afraid of change and often blame
the box with the view of the world
and the walls that fill the frame
i turn it up but then i turn it off
because i cant stand when they start to talk
about the hurtin and killin whose shoes are we fillin
the damage and ruin and the things that were doin
we gotta we got to stop we gotta turn it all off
we gotta rewind and start it up again

chorus
because we fell across the fall line
aint there nothin sacred anymore
nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

verse 2
somebody saw him jump yeah but nobody saw him slip
i guess he lost a lotta hope and then he lost his grip
now hes lyin in the freeway in the middle of this mess
guess we lost another one just like the other one
optimistic hypocrite that didnt have the nerve to quit
the things that kept him wantin more until he finally reached the core

we fell across the fall line
aint there nothin sacred anymore
nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah1embed"
