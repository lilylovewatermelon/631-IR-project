another human cloud to bring you down
when you blew the last away
and bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
but for me they look the same
well sometimes it can get all too much for me
and thats why the photograph gets burned
throw the match in gasoline aayy

prechorus
dont let the ones who hurt you see you cry
tomorrow is another day

chorus
you cannot stop the rain no way
holdin an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
tryna find somethin real but its not the game they play
pretendin that the weather is in your mind you got no one to blame
but thats just the way i feel

postchorus
you cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
you cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
another i me mine to blur the lines
between love and then heartbreak
oh its a lonely life thinkin youre right
and always shiftin blame
and every time its gettin more and more ugly
and thats why the photograph gets burned
throw the match in gasoline aayy

and it seems like time
can be so much more than a wakeup call
and live real life

between you and i
theres one thing i cant change
