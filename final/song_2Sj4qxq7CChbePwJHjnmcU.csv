been running from these feelings for so long
telling my heart i didnt need you
pretending i was better off alone
but i know that its just a lie
so afraid to take a chance again
so afraid of what i feel inside

chorus
but i need to be next to you
oh i oh i
i need to share every breath with you
oh i oh i
i need to know i can see your smile each morning
look into your eyes each night
for the rest of my life
here with you near with you
oh i i need to be next to you

verse 2
right here with you is where i belong
ill lose my mind if i cant see you
without you there is nothing in this life
that would make life worth living for
i cant bear the thought of you not there
i cant fight what i feel anymore

oh i i need to be next to you
i need to have your heart next to mine
for all time
love you for all of my life
