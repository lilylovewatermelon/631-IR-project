verse 1
when you feel it in your body you found somebody who
makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
said you act like you ready but you dont really know
and everything in your past you wanna let it go

prechorus

after all that this is what i found
nobody wants to be alone
if youre touched by the words in this song
then maybe

chorus

when youre on the phone oh yeah hang up and you call right back
oh you you got it you got it bad
if you miss a day without your friend your whole lifes offtrack

you got it bad when youre out with someone
but you keep on thinking bout somebody else
