verse
ran into some dead ends rerouted made a way
tennis chain ring watch light on the ice today
street nigga from the m thats where you gotta keep a k
it dont matter killers killin’ killers aint nobody safe
bullets dont discriminate just had to remind you
no matter how you try to dodge the bullshit it come find you
tryna put me in the middle cause my nigga robbed you
told you not to fuck with em but you act like you had to
pink slip eight whips aint none of em rented
bitch im havin money now so talk to me diffеrent
run the hunnids through the monеy counter before we deposit
life good bitch bad everything exotic
im cool waitin a lil longer for somethin i deserve
the streets aint for everybody thats why they made the curb
get clumsy talking bout elo im trippin over words
it was superbowl night wish he aint make that serve
have you ever got that phone call that made your heart drop
problems every time you turn around you live a hard knock
free my nigga heard the feds caught him pickin up a box
nothing but switches on these glizzies it came with the bump stock
i went back to where i grew up and i bought the residence
they come for me but i cant let em get me out my element
its easy buildin up a name but can you keep it relevant
play on my name you see more choppers than veterans ugh
and i said what i said wont beat around the bush
paint your block my favorite color red now you a pound of kush
i can put my hands in my pocket everybody with me push
these cartiers remind of the days when i was overlooked
fuck up after fuck up day by day now im havin my way
reason you cant get your own steak cause you keep watchin my plate
ive been layin low playin slow stackin change
made it through the rain can you feel a gangsta pain oh ohoh oh
see moneybagg yo liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likeoutro
made it through the rain can you feel a gangsta pain oh ohoh oh
the streets aint for everybody thats why they made the curb
ran into some dead ends rerouted made a wayembed"
