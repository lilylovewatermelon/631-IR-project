well im blowing smoke out of your window
and youre slippin back into your dress
you know you were always such a lady
ive always been impressed
but gentlemen they dont ask questions
we could laugh about it
just keep quiet pay attention
and you will show her for
gentlemen they dont ask questions
we could laugh about it
we could pay attention

chorus adam lazzara  fred mascherino
i said im gonna have myself in shambles
before your folks are up and lookin for some answers
said im gonna have myself in shambles
before your folks are up and lookin for some answers

verse 2 adam lazzara fred mascherino  adam lazzara  fred mascherino
well i pictured you in blue
but i have to say im more partial to the red
deep dark and devastating
leaving no question as to where youve been
i calmed the crowd by keeping quiet
moved like a shadow up to your mattress
gentlemen dont ask questions
we could pay attention
