do you wanna dance
fine but do you remember when
in your living room
when we made some room and moved ourselves around in it
its how my heart resumed
i got caught you got those caravaggio moves
we had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room

verse 2
do you wanna talk
fine ill talk it out with my dad
its always nice what he says
hell have some good advice from something in a book he read
if i did what i wanted then why do i feel so bad

verse 3
would you like a drink
while we wait for everything
to get good again
were good at things and so are a lot of our friends
we should forget these setbacks and get back moving again

chorus
i dont know what im afraid of
but im afraid
one day it all will fall away
maybe i read that
but still lets see
if nothing else its an idle curiosity
you might also likeverse 4
so would you like that drink
fine yeah i know i remember that too
in your living room right
when we began to fight but then we both felt confused
then we were laughing and crying in awe of the size of the moon

verse 5
do you want to die
fine youre right
but i wonder what it feels like
to stop feeling so alive
what if we could wake up in five years and thingsd be feeling alright
i wanna visit the future and dance in a field of light
chorus
i dont know what im afraid of
but im afraid
one day it all will fall away
maybe i read that
but still lets see
if nothing else its an idle curiosity3embed"
