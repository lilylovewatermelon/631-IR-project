911 whatâ€™s your emergency
pull the trigger on this nigga lets go

verse 1 doc coyle  kyle konkiel
im screaming hands up dont shoot
another finger on the trigger youre afraid of the truth
do you look at me and tell me
so you see another fucker that was ever undercover i dont fuck with you
fists up drop the cuffs
its the price youll never pay
a gun and a badge was a thing of the past
to protect and serve not slay

chorus tommy vext
another case and acquittal
another wife turned a widow
hands up dont shoot
hands up dont shoot
another heart breaks a little
a child left in the middle
hands up dont shoot
hands up another officer down

verse 2 doc coyle  kyle konkiel
i see the lights flash hit the gas
no one wants to speak the truth
do you look at me and tell me
do you see a motherfucker thats ever been scared of you
slammed breaks catch a case
another chase caught by patrol
the devils dance does not advance more quality control

another case and acquittal
another wife turned a widow
hands up dont shoot
hands up dont shoot
another heart breaks a little
a child left in the middle
hands up dont shoot
hands up another officer down

bridge
fuck your life up
pull that fucking trigger lets go

chorus tommy vext
another case and acquittal
another wife turned a widow
hands up dont shoot
hands up dont shoot
another heart breaks a little
a child left in the middle
hands up dont shoot
hands up another officer down
another officerembed"
