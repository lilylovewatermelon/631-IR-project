she picks up the phone
in my head i know im wrong
i just want to know what shes heard
im pacing back and forth cause i know that ive been caught
trying to think of the perfect words
chorus
so i can come to her and lie right to her face
i dont know what im gonna say
but i know that im gonna say
whatever it takes
ima run to her and lie right to her face
i dont know what im gonna say
but i know that im gonna say
whatever it takes
time is not on our side
cause shes waving goodbye goodbye
shes waving goodbye goodbye
smartphones dumb shit

verse 2
never knew i call so if she heard it all
im all out of luck tonight
i can say it was a joke but who am i kidding she aint slow
only way to make it right
