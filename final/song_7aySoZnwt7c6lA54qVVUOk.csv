time is going by so much faster than i
and im starting to regret not spending all of it with you
now im wondering why ive kept this bottled inside
so im starting to regret not telling all of it to you
so if i havent yet ive gotta let you know

chorus
youre never gonna be alone
from this moment on
if you ever feel like letting go
i wont let you fall
youre never gonna be alone
ill hold you til the hurt is gone

verse 2
and now as long as i can im holding on with both hands
cause forever i believe that theres nothing i could need but you
so if i havent yet ive gotta let you know

chorus
youre never gonna be alone
from this moment on
if you ever feel like letting go
i wont let you fall
when all hope is gone i know that you can carry on
we’re gonna take the world on
ill hold you til the hurt is gone

oh
youve gotta live every single day
like its the only one what if tomorrow never comes
dont let it slip away
could be our only one you know its only just begun
every single day
maybe our only one what if tomorrow never comes
tomorrow never comes

when all hope is gone i know that you can carry on
we’re gonna take the world on
ill hold you til the hurt is gone
