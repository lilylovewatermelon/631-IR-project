i pack my case i check my face
i look a little bit older
i look a little bit colder
with one deep breath and one big step i move a little bit closer
i move a little bit closer
for reasons unknown

verse 2
i caught my stride
i flew and flied
i know if destiny’s kind i’ve got the rest of my mind
but my heart it don’t beat it don’t beat the way it used to
and my eyes they don’t see you no more
and my lips they don’t kiss they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you no more

chorus
for reasons unknown

verse 3
there was an open chair
we sat down in the open chair
i said if destiny’s kind i’ve got the rest of my mind
but my heart it don’t beat it don’t beat the way it used to
and my eyes they don’t see you no more
and my lips they don’t kiss they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you at all

i said my heart it don’t beat it don’t beat the way it used to and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
and my lips they don’t kiss they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
