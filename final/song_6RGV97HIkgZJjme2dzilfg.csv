i came here by day
but i left here in darkness
and found you found you on the way
and now it is silver and silent
it is silver and cold
you in somber resplendence i hold

chorus all davey havok
your sins into me
oh my beautiful one
your sins into me
as a rapturous voice escapes i will tremble a prayer
and ill beg for forgiveness
your sins into me your sins into me
oh my beautiful one

verse 2 davey havok
light like the flutter of wings
feel your hollow voice rushing into me
as youre longing to sing
so i
i will paint you in silver
i will wrap you in cold
i will lift up your voice as i sink
