sittin here drinkin beer in this honkytonk
girl at the next table overs comin on strong
shes flirtin and aworkin everything that god gave her
but she dont understand
that i got a woman who knows how to keep her man

verse 2
lipstick lips and long legs turn my head
but that dont mean im gonna wind up in their bed
im comin home to my baby
and it aint because of this little bitty golden band
its cause i got a woman who knows how to keep her man

chorus
lord now shes hotter than hell
shes got to be a twelve on a scale of one to ten
she gives me that lovin til ive had enough
and then she does it again
lord she grabs me by the heart
when she breaks out her fryin pan
hey i got a woman who knows how to keep her man

verse 3
she dont mind when i wanna go do my own thing
she can always tell when i need a little space
and thats what keeps me comin on back home
and eatin from the palm of her hand
hey boys i gotta woman who knows how to keep her man
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
well shes hotter than hell
shes got to be a twelve on a scale of one to ten
shes one tough mother and all my buddies love her
shes a dallas cowboys fan
she grabs me by the heart
when she breaks out her fryin pan
hey i got a woman who knows how to keep her man

outro
oh i know if i get outta line
i gotta hide that fryin pan
hey i gotta woman who knows how to keep her man
she knows how to keep her manembed"
