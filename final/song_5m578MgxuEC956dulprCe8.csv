i called the teacher cause i wanted to confess it now
can i make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
she spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

prechorus
i dont take these things so personal anymore anymore
i dont think its irreversible anymore

verse 2
somebody hooted and they hollered can i buy a vowel
dont let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
and when its not as it appears to be the flagrant foul
can i put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl

prechorus
i dont think that its so terrible anymore anymore
i dont think that its unbearable anymore

chorus
tell me now i know that it just wont stop
you will find your flow when you go robot
i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots dont care where ive been
youve got to choose it to use it so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 3
sometimes i feel like im a sentimental trooper
she cried so hard you know she looked like alice cooper

prechorus
i dont think that its so personal anymore anymore
i dont think its irreversible anymore

chorus
tell me now i know that it just wont stop
you will find your flow when you go robot
i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots dont care where ive been
youve got to choose it to use it so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin

verse 4
im kissin high and low our bodies like two dominoes
can i come and get you when i hit you in your party clothes
lets turn this cosplay holiday what we obey
and now were welcoming each other to this cabaret

prechorus
i dont think that its so terrible anymore anymore
i dont think that its unbearable anymore
chorus
tell me now i know that it just wont stop
you will find your flow when you go robot
i want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
robots dont care where ive been
youve got to choose it to use it so let me plug it in
robots are my next of kin12embed"
