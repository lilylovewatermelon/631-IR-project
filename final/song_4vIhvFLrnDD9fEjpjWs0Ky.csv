babe babe babe

hook
your friend was prayin
on our downfall baby
swear she was waitin
i know i more than fucked up
now i feel stupid
why would i do this

verse 1
she aint know no better but i did
poor decision making for the kid
and all because you left us for a second
now i’m tryna figure out the lesson
of all the people i fucked up on you
what the fuck was i supposed to do
this shit is sticky
its tricky
and kinda hard to explain
wanna refrain but being human is strange
apologizing in advance for the pain

hook
your friend was prayin
on our downfall baby
swear she was waitin
i know i more than fucked up
now i feel stupid
why would i do this
you might also likeverse 2
trying to tell you what it is
she came to the crib
whispered in my ear some shit i wanna hear
then told me yall aint cool
were finished yall were through
so then i took her word aint run that shit by you
i made myself believe everything was okay
meanwhile she at your house
she smiling in your face
she smiling in your face
but you don’t even know
so i can’t even say

hook
your friend was prayin
on our downfall baby
swear she was waitin
i know i more than fucked up
now i feel stupid
why would i do this

your friend was prayin
on our downfall baby
swear she was waitin
i know i more than fucked up
now i feel stupid
why would i do this6embed"
