verse 1 natalie
listen at first you said i do but now its i did
said together we should live
now youre mad with time we spend
used to be jealous of my friends and fill my weekends
but now youre off for pastimes
playin games with my mind
youre layin the blame in my lap
but delaying laying in our bed
yo i meant what i said when you werent listening
and im not saying it again

hook marsha
i get a headache
ahooh ahooh oh
i get a headache
ahooh ahooh oh ooh ohooh oh

yo said im not saying it again
you need to know that
see im coming to the end of my silent partnering
or barganing for affection
i gain satisfaction from regulation bare minimum
your mind is made on obeying opinions from
acquaintances whose situation suggest loneliness
i try to leave but you protest professing you love me
but cant show me lovin
you want out but you keep me in
patience runs thin as you go through your motions
i cry oceans tears become orphans
as my soul leaves its apartment
i get migraines heart strains tear stains and fear gains
with increases in the pain
yo i get a headache

hook marsha
i get a headache
ahooh ahooh ahooh ahooh
said i get a headache ah
ah ah ahooh ahooh oh ooh
baby oh i i
i get a headache ey
ahooh ahooh
said i get a headache oh yeah
ahooh ahooh oh ooh ah ah
