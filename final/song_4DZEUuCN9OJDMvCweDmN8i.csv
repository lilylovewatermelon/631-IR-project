verse 1
papas in the kitchen mamas in the field
murder in the hen house mud flung high upon the wheels
rooster in the dooryard just leaning on the horn
wind so sweetly drifting through the ripening corn

chorus
hey me hey mama
where you been for so long for so long
hey me hey mama
where you been where you been for so long

verse 2
theres something outrageous bout that evening sky
this side of dangerous that look in your eye
always knew that you were crazy always knew you could be cruel
still i would do just about anything in the world for you

chorus
hey me hey mama
where you been for so long for so long
hey me hey mama
where you been where you been for so long

left me standing in the corner with my head so hanging down
punch drunk busted up and reeling like a rodeo clown
always seem to hit me like a lightning from above
guess i just wasnt ready for such a heavy handed love

chorus
hey me hey mama
where you been for so long for so long
hey me hey mama
where you been where you been for so long
hey me hey mama
where you been for so long for so long

chorus

where you been where you been for so long
hey me hey mama
where you been where you been for so long1embed"
