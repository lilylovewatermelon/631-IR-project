i love you there’s nothing to hide
it’s better than burning inside
i love you no use to pretend
there i’ve said it again
i’ve said it what more can i say
believe me there’s no other way
i just love you and will to the end
there i’ve said it again

i tried to drum up
a frase that would sum up
all that i feel that i feel for you
but what good are frazes
the thought that amazes
is you love me and it’s so heavenly
forgive me for wanting you so
there’s one thing i want you to know
 and that i love you so
heaven knows when
there i’ve said it again
there i’ve said it againyou might also likeembed"
