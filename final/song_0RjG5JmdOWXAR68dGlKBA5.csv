we were playing in the sand
and you found a little band
you told me you fell in love with it
hadnt gone as id planned
when you had to bid adieu ooh ooh ooh
said youd never love anew ooh ooh ooh
i wondered if i could hold it
and fall in love with it too
you told me to buy a pony
but all i wanted was you
