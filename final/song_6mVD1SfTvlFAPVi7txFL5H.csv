im putting your patience to the test
im putting your body on the line for less
didnt you know there was a choice
its never yours but someone elses voice

verse 2
sellin your body to the street
sending your girlfriends to the night for cheap
wearing a jacket made of meat
sealing a letter made with horses feet
and now youve heard that

chorus 1
waves turn to grey
life in the shade
a violent crime
and thats the usa
platinums on the rise
sleeping in the sky
im just tryin to find
a mountain i can climb

darling aint nobody gonna tell us
theyre gonna be oh so jealous
were gonna be oh so silent
theyre gonna be stoned in silence
i didnt want to ask you baby
i didnt want to have to ask anybody baby
is anyone asking maybe
can anyone even hear me

why are you waiting beyond the door

chorus 3
life turns to dust
and rain turns to rust
gossip is a truth
and money pays for the lies we trust
your love is a surprise
homeless saints are in disguise
im just tryin to find
a nice place for you and i18embed"
