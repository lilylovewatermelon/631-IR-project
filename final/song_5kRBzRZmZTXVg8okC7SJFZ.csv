i think about that day
i left him at a greyhound station
west of santa f√©
we were seventeen but he was sweet and it was true
still i did what i had to do
cause i just knew
summer sunday nights
wed sink into our seats
right as they dimmed out all the lights
a technicolor world made out of music and machine
it called me to be on that screen
and live inside each scene

first girl  first man
without a nickel to my name
hopped a bus here i came
could be brave or just insane

first girl first man  second man
well have to see
you might also likefirst girl
cause maybe in that sleepy town
hell sit one day the lights are down
hell see my face and think of how he

first girl first man second man  dancers
used to know me

all
climb these hills
im reaching for the heights
and chasing all the lights that shine
and when they let you down
youll get up off the ground
cause morning rolls around
and its another day of sun

young man
i hear em evry day
the rhythms in the canyons
thatll never fade away
the ballads in the barrooms
left by those who came before
they say you gotta want it more
so i bang on evry door
second girl
and even when the answers no
or when my moneys running low
the dusty mic and neon glow
are all i need

young man
and someday as i sing my song
a smalltown kidll come along

second girl  young man
thatll be the thing to push him on and go go

all
climb these hills
im reaching for the heights
and chasing all the lights that shine
and when they let you down
youll get up off the ground
cause morning rolls around
and its another day of sun

instrumental break

first girl
and when they let you down
the morning rolls around
all
its another day of sun
its another day of sun
its another day of sun
its another day of sun
just another day of sun
its another day of sun
another day has just begun
its another day of sun

its another day of sun20embed"
