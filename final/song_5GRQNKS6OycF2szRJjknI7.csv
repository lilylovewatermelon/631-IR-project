as i sit as i sit
and i stare into the clouds
and watch the world turn
is this where we belong
or is it a step to fill
makes me wonder makes me think shoryuken
everything we do is weak
turn down
oh cause look at the mess weve made
whos gonna clean it up
oh my god wheres captain planet
perception what you see
compared to reality so far away
you are so drunk you miss it all yay
just make sure you have the right jordans on
or be left behind to rot and die
face down in the gutter

verse 2 pharrell
this is gonna sound like i was just hitting the hash zone
they make us think its a race war when the war is in class show em
teachers come through the speakers images through the glass foam
subliminal messages influencing the whole clash alone
black white gay straight human beings all pee and want some ass chrome
if you scared of different then you should not take the same path
if all lives matter when we mention black why do you gasp bro
behind our blue skies is the sun whos surrounded by black tone
i love the camo but why have more ammo than mash dont
instead of blowing yourself up take a love pill and laugh you wont
and laugh hasee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like7embed"
