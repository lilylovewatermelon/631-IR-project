it weighs heavier on ones heart
i could tell right from the start that sweet ones are hard to come across
well there is more than meets the eye
heart like yours is rare to find
someone elses gain will be my loss

verse 2
well little things that make you smile
dancing barefoot in the dark
if only i had strength to change your mind
oh for what you need
you will not see
choose your words before you speak
can you see that all youve got is time
