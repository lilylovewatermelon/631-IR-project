woo its hot outside man
meek millys coming daddy

verse 1 meek mill
hundred for the walkthrough im not who you talk to
drive by and wet you up nigga thats a carpool
spitting all this hot shit every single bar cool
diamonds in the rollie face animated cartoon
call me meek milly i dont play that shit
got me on my nappy braids before the maybach clique
riding in the wheels of fortune pat sajak shit
and all i rock is balmain like i made that shit
ive been front row fashion week looking like im in the show
sitting in the foreign leather softer than a dinner roll
make a movie on your bitch tell her friend to get a role
you thought she was innocent we laughing like she been a ho
jumpin out them benzos meet yo bitch in the friend zone
she told you i was friendzoned what im in the endzone
touchdown with a 2 point conversion give her that dick long
she busting like the clip long uber to send your bitch home nigga

interlude swizz beatz
its hot outside its meek milly season

chorus swizz beatz
i got a fever bitch
hot outside i got a fever bitch
feeling sick i got a fever bitch
in these philly streets situations is
police aint respecting the youth and
the youth aint respecting the truth and
the glock 9 is on me in the booth and
all i talk is that real shit the truth and
you might also likeverse 2 meek mill
the money turned your bitch into a gold digger
the money got me feeling like the old jigga
and jigga even told me you a cold nigga
they aint believe me i was broke but i showed niggas
and i told niggas that i would expose niggas
went to buy a pair of sneaks landed at the royce dealer
brand new paper tag haters never made me mad
you can ask your baby momma im flyer than her baby dad
looking at my neck what that cost hundredeighty cash
looking at my bitch she remind me of a stacey dash
we was selling rock before kareem biggs damon dash
oh you think you fly with your lil dream chasin ass
we dont chase bitches we chase money and that duss√©
cause when you get the money the hoes do whatever you say
riding in a drop head phantom with the toupee
and if youre just hearing this then its probably too late

chorus swizz beatz
i got a fever bitch
hot outside i got a fever bitch
feeling sick i got a fever bitch
in these philly streets situations is
police aint respecting the youth and
the youth aint respecting the truth and
the glock 9 on me in the booth and
all i talk is that real shit the truth and
outro swizz beatz
meek milly mack milly
get smacked silly come to philly
come see it live in direct
you know godamnit45embed"
