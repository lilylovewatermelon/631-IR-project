every day im counting up my paper
petty niggas hate the ones in public with the vapors
leave em in the dust and then we tell em see you later
only people that truly know me is my mama and my maker
shawty you like my freeform dreads
i love it when she give a nigga freeform head
its the banana boy favorite color you know
yellow is the new black and im mr caputo

chorus
close the blinds
i want to see me shine
dont want to hear you chime
i want to see me glisten
close the blinds
i want to see me shine
dont want to hear you chime
i want to see me glisten
