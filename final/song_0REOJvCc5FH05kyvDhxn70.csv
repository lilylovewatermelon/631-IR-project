she says wake up its no use pretending
i’ll keep stealing breathing her
birds are leaving over autumns ending
one of us will die inside these arms

chorus
eyes wide open
naked as we came
one will spread our ashes round the yard

verse 2
she says if i leave before you darling
don’t you waste me in the ground
i lay smiling like our sleeping children
one of us will die inside these arms

chorus
eyes wide open
naked as we came
one will spread our ashes round the yardsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
