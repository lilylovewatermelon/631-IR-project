chorus
i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
oh and i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
oh and i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
i think im losing you

verse 1
switchblade round my neck dont get close to me
ask about your life still in the nosebleeds
laying in your bed call that intimacy
wish i could get past the security
wonder why i wake up living in a madeup
dream of you and i together there
baby wake the fuck up time for you to grow up
dont you know that life is rarely ever fair

chorus
i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
oh and i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
i wouldnt ask you to take care of me
oh and i wouldnt ask you to take care of me

verse 2
tell you how i feel i keep it real clean
lock hanging round my neck you dont get a key
come a little closer ill show you what i mean
oh boy you know its all for me
icecold baby im icecold
youre the only one who can make me fold
icecold baby im icecold
youre the only one who can make me fold
