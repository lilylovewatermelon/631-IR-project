some boys kiss me some boys hug me
i think theyre okay
if they dont give me proper credit i just walk away
they can beg and they can plead
but they cant see the light thats right
cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always mister right

chorus
cause we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl

verse 2
some boys romance some boys slow dance
thats all right with me
if they cant raise my interest then i have to let them be
some boys try and some boys lie
but i dont let them play no way
only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

chorus
cause we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl

verse 3
boys may come and boys may go
and thats all right you see
experience has made me rich and now theyre after me

chorus
cause everybodys living in a material world

you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl

and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
