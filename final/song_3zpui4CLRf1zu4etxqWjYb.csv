im going to clean the house
im going to fix the fence
in my final hours
im going to tie up these loose ends
i wonâ€™t leave a note
for anyone to find
tomorrow theyll know
what ive done here tonight

chorus
the drastic steps im taking
are just an act of desperation
i knew no one would miss me
so what the hell
i fought and lied i drank too much
hurt everyone i ever touched
just how much i hurt you is hard to tell
this is not some kind of cry for help
just good bye i wish you well
because i love you
im going to kill myself

verse 2
now who is that
in my easy chair
now wait a minute
thats the old me sitting there
and i thank god
the devil in me died
i stand before you now
a man changed and alive

the drastic steps im taking
are just an act of desperation
i knew no one would miss me
so what the hell
i fought and lied i drank too much
hurt everyone i ever touched
just how much i hurt you is hard to tell
this is not some kind of cry for help
just good bye i wish you well
because i love you
i have to kill myself
