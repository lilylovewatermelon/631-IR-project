you showed me my tomorrow beside a box of matches
a welcome threatening stir
my hopes of being stolen might just ring true
depends who you prefer
if its true youre gonna run away
tell me where ill meet you there

verse 2
am i snapping the excitement
if i pack away the laughter and tell you how it feels
and does burden come to meet ya
if ive questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel
the day after you stole my heart
everything i touched told me
it would be better shared with you with you

bridge
and now youre hiding in my soup
and this book reveals your face
and youre splashing in my eyelids
as the concentration continually breaks
i did request the mark you cast
didnt heal as fast
i hear your voice in silences
will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud
you might also likeoutro
in the jostling crowd youre not allowed to tell the truth
and the photo booths a liar
and theres a sharpened explanation
but theres no screaming reason to inquire
id like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
theyd never see if it smacked them in their temples17embed"
