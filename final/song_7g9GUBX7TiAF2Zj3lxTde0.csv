check it out
uhahah top of the morning to you
you know its been so dark outside
that iâ€”that i figured id turn a couple motherfuckin lights on real quick

verse mac miller
uh
i aint talkin bout nothin with a flow so disgutin
ashtray by me that i gotta dump my guts in
need substance feed it to the public
no one gon touch it like my poppys old musket
roll up to the function eatin all the funyuns
sentence keep runnin word to double e cummings
when people say to me it doesnt mean nothin
bumblebees buzzin cause the trouble needs lovin
wonder who really give a fuck what i have to say
those are the people to which i dedicate this rap today
your shit is fragile if i have to ima crack your face
monday to saturday im actin like a basket case
while sunday im goin golfin with my callaways
or watchin football word to joey galloway
take a shower start singin like al green
from outside it probably sound like some loud screams
always had child dreams and nightmares
my music like the airport i hop on a flight there
wanna go to monaco to see what its like there
roll up in a pair of nike airs just like yeah
wassup here i am lookin in the mirror and
all i see is me im at peace
go rent out a penthouse forget all my problems
the things i regret now be gone by the mornin
my life is startin im ready as i ever been
pencilin my schedule that i gotta move on from mistakes
number one albums always givin you mixtapes
and thats what ima do until im richer than bill gates
it aint all about money for me though
i do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
work a lot im an addict not a fiend though
get up get out and get somethin word to cee lo
bottles of clicquot a couple of cristal
may head to la like im chris paul
bout to go platinum off of missed calls
so all of yall can lick balls ha ha
yeah
just you know
