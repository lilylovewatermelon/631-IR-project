livin this life has been a heavy load
cant turn around dont wanna go back home
theres a half a thirty pack in my back seat
passed out buddys in the front with me
aint much help but he keeps me from feelin lonely

makin miles around this washed up town
got my radio up and the dash dimmed down
my minds racin just like these 8 lug wheels
tonight im gonna serenade my steerin wheel

this workin week sure wore me out
rather be in motion instead of sittin down
starin at the walls and writin down sad songs
they say loves a drug i guess got hooked
theres no bookin rehab or id be booked
i need somethin to help with these withdrawals

makin miles around this washed up town
got my radio up and the dash dimmed down
my minds racin just like these 8 lug wheels
tonight im gonna serenade my steerin wheel
