im sorry
i heard about the bad news today
a crowd of people around you
telling you its okay
and everything happens for a reason

chorus 1
when you lose a part of yourself
to somebody you know
it takes a lot to let go
every breath that you remember
pictures fade away but memory is forever

chorus 2
an empty chair at all the tables
and ill be seeing you when all my days boil down
but its better where youre going anyway

verse 2
im sorry
i heard about the bad news today
its really hard to get through
tough times and long days
but it really just depends on the season

verse 4
