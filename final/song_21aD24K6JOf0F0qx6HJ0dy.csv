daddy doesnt pray anymore
i guess hes finished talkin to the lord
he used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
but daddy doesnt pray anymore

verse 1
i remember even when the times were bad
he thanked jesus for everything he had
for a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
yeah everything was right when he said grace

chorus
daddy doesnt pray anymore
i guess hes finished talkin to the lord
he used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
but daddy doesnt pray anymore

verse 2
there was a time when we didnt get along
cause i thought i was right and he was wrong
still when i laid down at night id hear him get down on his knees
and say a little prayer for me

chorus
daddy doesnt pray anymore
i guess hes finished talkin to the lord
he used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
but daddy doesnt pray anymore

bridge
today i followed daddy down to church
and listened to the preacher read gods word
and we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didnt make a sound
and this afternoon well lay him in the ground

chorus
daddy doesnt pray anymore
i guess hes finally walkin with the lord
he used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
but daddy doesnt pray anymore4embed"
