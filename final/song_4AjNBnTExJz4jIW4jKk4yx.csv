i spent the end of last october
crying on your shoulder
ill just never win
were going through this
im not even there
im never there

verse 2
my mind
it could use a little peace and quiet
my soul
wouldnt mind a warm place to hide
my ears
red and sore from always standing in the snow
my lungs need air
i spent it on all the thankyous and goodbyes

chorus
im scared
im helpless
im shaking
im weak
my bones
i feel them breaking
im tired
of losing against me
im lost
i cant win

my tongue
is bleeding red from all the things i cant say
my hands
are clawing at the dirt to dig up anything
i cant say
i didnt wish for this before
im ashamed
i dont deserve to be here anymore

chorus
im scared
im helpless
im shaking
im weak
my bones
i feel them breaking
im tired
of losing against me
im lost
i cant winembed"
