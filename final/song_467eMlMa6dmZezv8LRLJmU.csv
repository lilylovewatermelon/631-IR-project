that boy cassius

chorus
fast lane nigga soul chain drippin real fame
whole gang geekin on the plane like its soul plane
whats your name catch a stain all we know is gangbang
what you gon do if i front you a couple of them things what you gon do
block hot leave the spot gotta have patience
didnt know what a bando was til we said its vacant bando
one point two i cash out in casinos out in vegas one point two
give me my cash and money my nigga no time for no wait no

verse 1
all my fingers achin achin
im in love with faces faces
niggas pumpfakin pump
and i remember faces faces
ive been through the phases phases
let me out the cages cages
heard that you was slavin slavin
minimum your wages wages
im on front pages pages
my pinky ring your savings savings
hope you dont think im flexin flexin
my necklace your checkings checkings
i am an investor vestor
so i make investments cash
plain jane got me talkin proper etiquette proper
your main thing say she faithful she with all the shits all the shit
i might take a startin five make em sit that bench sit down
make me grip the whole fire cause i see youre tense tense
i done steal some cookies off that planet still dense cookie
codeine i drank the last drop i cant leave a drip lean
i poured a four the glass top jumpin off the cliff lean
poppin big shit and we jumpin out the vip
niggas jumpin out their skin got you runnin out your flips run

suck that bitch its still head if she let it touch her lips
fast cars fast i might drag then i drift fast car

verse 2
trappin at the station trappin
trappin different places trappin
ballin like the pacers
but they keep on foulin flagrant
im the chosen one
was picken by the man aint no mistake
dont need no twitter or no insta for no stamp of verification
that coupe look like a caterpillar
came and pulled it straight from haiti
put that cookie in rotation
hotboxin no ventillation
all of my bitches they different in races
go get the bag then stack it and save it
givin him work to see what he do with it
you want your life or you want the paper pick one
the things aint right
i pick up the can im aimin at faces
so you better think twice twice
fore you try to rob or you try to play me
no well she not the wife no
but she want the dick and she want a baby baby
im livin my life life
the ups and downs im goin through phases phases
