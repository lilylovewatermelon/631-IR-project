well tamatoa hasnt always been this glam
i was a drab little crab once
now i know i can be happy as a clam
because im beautiful baby
did your granny say listen to your heart
be who you are on the inside
i need three words to tear her argument apart
your granny lied
id rather be shiny
like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
scrub the deck and make it look shiny
i will sparkle like a wealthy womans neck
just a sec dont you know
fish are dumb dumb dumb
they chase anything that glitters beginners
oh and here they come come come
to the brightest thing that glitters
mmm fish dinners

i just love free food free food
and you look like seafood seafood

well well well
little mauis having trouble with his look
you little semidemiminigod
ouch what a terrible performance
get the hook get it
you dont swing it like you used to man
you might also likeyet i have to give you credit for my start
and your tattoos on the outside
for just like you i made myself a work of art
ill never hide i cant
im too shiny
watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
strut my stuff my stuff is so shiny
send your armies but theyll never be enough
my shells too tough maui man
you could try try try
but you cant expect a demigod
to beat a decapod look it up
you will die die die
now its time for me to take apart
your aching heart
far from the ones who abandoned you
chasing the love of these humans
who made you feel wanted
you try to be tough
but your armours just not hard enough
maui now its time to kick your hiney
ever seen someone so
shiny
soak it in cause its the last youll ever see
cest la vie mon ami im so shiny
now ill eat you so prepare your final plea
just for me
youll never be quite as shiny
you wish you were nice and shiny13embed"
