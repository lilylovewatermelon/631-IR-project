i said mama dont you worry
im gettin by just fine out on the road
yeah tonight we played in knoxville
and tomorrow night its back to music row
naw i dont know when im comin home
montgomery seems so very far away
she said boy it wouldnt kill you now
to look out past the bright lights on that stage

chorus
cause god put stars in alabama
you just cant find in tennessee
the same ones are waitin on you
that taught you how to dream
i know theres big names up in nashville
and youll be one before too long
but god put stars in alabama
to help you find your way back home

verse 2
i hung up the phone and i could feel
the emptiness at 80 miles an hour
and i listened close and i could hear
my heart beatin louder than the tires
this old bus was headed west
but my mind was driftin somewhere toward the south
and i closed my eyes and i could see the bright lights shinin clearly through the clouds

cause god put stars in alabama

and youll be one before too long
but god put stars in alabama
to help you find your way back home

outro
yeah theres stars in alabama
that just cant wait til you get homeembed"
