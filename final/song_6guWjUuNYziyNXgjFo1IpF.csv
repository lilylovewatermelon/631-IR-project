this is my kinda town
this is my kinda place
i wouldnt mind hangin round
for more than just a couple days
i got a 12th floor room
with a killer view
of the empty astrodome
got a tab at the bar downstairs
but all i can think about is home

chorus
i got my new boots covered in red dirt
a dont mess with texas tshirt
and a lonestar postcard postmarked with missin you
its got the biggest sky youve ever seen
the coldest beer youd ever drink
but i still feel like i landed on the moon
cause it aint got you
houston we got a problem

verse 2
you shouldve seen 19th street
you shouldve seen a midnight rodeo
the way them saloon doors swing
when they line dance to copperhead road
something bout the air down here
thatll make you feel
the way all them cowboys do
i wish i was an outlaw
but all i can think about is you

and a lonestar postcard postmarked with missin you

but i still feel like i landed on the moon
cause it aint got you
