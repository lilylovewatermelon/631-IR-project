verse 1
we were young and drinking in the park
there was nowhere else to go
and you said you always had my back
oh but how were we to know

prechorus
that these are the days that bind you together forever
and these little things define you forever forever

chorus
all this bad blood here wont you let it dry
its been cold for years wont you let it lie

postchorus

if were only ever looking back
we will drive ourselves insane
as the friendship goes resentment grows
we will walk our different ways

prechorus
but those are the days that bind us together forever
and those little things define us forever forever

chorus
all this bad blood here wont you let it dry
its been cold for years wont you let it lie

bridge
i dont wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
i dont wanna hear you talk about it anymore
i dont wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
i dont wanna talk about it i dont wanna talk about it
i dont wanna talk about it i dont wanna talk about it
i dont wanna hear you talk about it anymore
i dont wanna talk about it i dont wanna talk about it
i dont wanna talk about it i dont wanna talk about it
i dont wanna talk

chorus
all this bad blood here wont you let it dry
its been cold for years wont you let it lie
