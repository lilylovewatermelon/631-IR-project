i am walking through your streets
i am looking in your windows
i am elemental now
youll never even know im there
i am watching over you
i am living in the shadows
i am just a word to you
but i am very real and cold

prechorus
cold to all of this
cold to how you feel
cold to all your lucid reason

chorus
i am everything
i am anything
i am automatic
i am yesterday
i am every day
i am gonna be

verse 2
i am all there is to know
i am all that youve forgotten
i am enigmatic now
you never even knew my name
i am dressed in tragedy
i am by design immortal
i am just the last one left
but i am always here and old

i am just a secret now
i am just a vague illusion
im a lie you tell yourself
that you never truly did believe
im a whisper in the dark
im a victim and the killer
