little girl little girl why are you cryin
inside your restless soul your heart is dyin
little one little one your soul is purgin
of love and razor blades your blood is surgin

chorus
run away from the river to the street
and find yourself with your face in the gutter
youre a stray for the salvation army
there is no place like home when you got no place to go

verse 2
little girl little girl your life is callin
the charlatans and saints of your abandon
little one little one the sky is fallin
your lifeboat of deception is now sailin
in the wake all the way all the way no rhyme or reason
your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
little girl little girl you dirty liar
youre just a junkie preachin to the choir

chorus
run away from the river to the street
and find yourself with your face in the gutter
youre a stray for the salvation army
there is no place like home when you got no place to go
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likebridge
the traces of blood always follow you home
like the mascara tears from your getaway gloria
youre walkin with blisters and running with shears
so unholy sister of grace

interlude

outro
run away from the river to the street
and find yourself with your face in the gutter
youre a stray from the salvation army
there is no place like home29embed"
