heard your voice in between the lines
come around from another time
where nobody ever goes

all alone on the overpass
wired and phoned to a heart of glass
now im falling in love too fast
with you or the songs you chose
and all the stars play for me
say the promise you long to keep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep

ive been living in your cassette
its the modern equivalent
singing up to a capulet
on a balcony in your mind
in the city the lion sleeps
pray to sony my soul to keep
were you ever so bright and sweet
did you ever look so nice
and all the sounds dream for me mmm hmmm

i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
you might also likeand all the sounds dream for me
dive me down in a soul so deep

i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep
i can hear you i can hear you
i can hear you singing to me in my
i can hear you singing to me in my sleep

ohhh oooh
ohhh oooh
ohhh ooohembed"
