roll away your stone ill roll away mine
and together we can see what we will find
dont leave me alone at this time
for i am afraid of what i will discover inside

verse 2
see you told me that i would find a hole
within the fragile substance of my soul
and i have filled this void with things unreal
and all the while my character it steals

chorus
darkness is a harsh term dont you think
and yet it dominates the things i seek

verse 3
it seems that all my bridges have been burned
but you say thats exactly how this grace thing works
its not the long walk home
that will change this heart
but the welcome i receive with the restart

chorus
darkness is a harsh term dont you think
and yet it dominates the things i seek
darkness is a harsh term dont you think
and yet it dominates the things i seek

stars hide your fires
these here are my desires
and i will give them up to you this time around
and so ill be found
with my stake stuck in this ground
marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
hide your fires
these here are my desires
and i will give them up to you this time around
and so ill be found
with my stake stuck in this ground
marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul

outro
but you youve gone too far this time
you have neither reason nor rhyme
with which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
