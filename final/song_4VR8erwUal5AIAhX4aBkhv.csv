no more carefree laughter
silence ever after
walking through an empty house tears in my eyes
here is where the story ends this is goodbye

chorus frida  agnetha björn  benny
knowing me knowing you aha
there is nothing we can do
knowing me knowing you aha
we just have to face it this time were through
this time were through this time were really through
this time were through were really through
breaking up is never easy i know but i have to go
i have to go this time i have to go this time i know
knowing me knowing you its the best i can do

verse 2 frida  agnetha
memories good days bad days memories good days bad days
theyll be with me always theyll be with me always
in these old familiar rooms children would play
now theres only emptiness nothing to say

chorus frida  agnetha björn  benny
knowing me knowing you aha
there is nothing we can do
knowing me knowing you aha
we just have to face it this time were through
this time were through this time were really through
this time were through were really through
breaking up is never easy i know but i have to go
i have to go this time i have to go this time i know
knowing me knowing you its the best i can do
