the sorrows of m de charlus — his sham duel — the stations on the ‘transatlantic’— weary of albertine i decide to break with her

i was dropping with sleep i was taken up to my floor not by the liftboy but by the squinting page who to make conversation informed me that his sister was still with the gentleman who was so rich and that on one occasion when she had made up her mind to return home instead of sticking to her business her gentleman friend had paid a visit to the mother of the squinting page and of the other more fortunate children who had very soon made the silly creature return to her protector “you know sir she’s a fine lady my sister is she plays the piano she talks spanish and you would never take her for the sister of the humble employee who brings you up in the lift she denies herself nothing madame has a maid to herself i shouldn’t be surprised if one day she keeps her carriage she is very pretty if you could see her a little too high and mighty but good lord you can understand that she’s full of fun she never leaves a hotel without doing something first in a wardrobe or a drawer just to leave a little keepsake with the chambermaid who will have to wipe it up sometimes she does it in a cab and after she’s paid her fare she’ll hide behind a tree and she doesn’t half laugh when the cabby finds he’s got to clean his cab after her my father had another stroke of luck when he found my young brother that indian prince he used to know long ago it’s not the same style of thing of course but it’s a superb position the travelling by itself would be a dream i’m the only one still on the shelf but you never know we’re a lucky family perhaps one day i shall be president of the republic but i’m keeping you talking” i had not uttered a single word and was beginning to fall asleep as i listened to the flow of his “goodnight sir oh thank you sir if everybody had as kind a heart as you there wouldn’t be any poor people left but as my sister says ‘there will always have to be the poor so that now i’m rich i can s — t on them’ you’ll pardon the expression goodnight sir”

   perhaps every night we accept the risk of facing while we are asleep sufferings which we regard as unreal and unimportant because they will be felt in the course of a sleep which we suppose to be unconscious and indeed on these evenings when i came back late from la raspelière i was very sleepy but after the weather turned cold i could not get to sleep at once for the fire lighted up the room as though there were a lamp burning in it only it was nothing more than a blazing log and — like a lamp too for that matter like the day when night gathers — its too bright light was not long in fading and i entered a state of slumber which is like a second room that we take into which leaving our own room we go when we want to sleep it has noises of its own and we are sometimes violently awakened by the sound of a bell perfectly heard by our ears although nobody has rung it has its servants its special visitors who call to take us out so that we are ready to get up when we are compelled to realise by our almost immediate transmigration into the other room the room of overnight that it is empty that nobody has called

   the race that inhabits it is like that of our first human ancestors androgynous a man in it appears a moment later in the form of a woman things in it shew a tendency to turn into men men into friends and enemies the time that elapses for the sleeper during these spells of slumber is absolutely different from the time in which the life of the waking man is passed sometimes its course is far more rapid a quarter of an hour seems a day at other times far longer we think we have taken only a short nap when we have slept through the day then in the chariot of sleep we descend into depths in which memory can no longer overtake it and on the brink of which the mind has been obliged to retrace its steps the horses of sleep like those of the sun move at so steady a pace in an atmosphere in which there is no longer any resistance that it requires some little aerolith extraneous to ourselves hurled from the azure by some unknown to strike our regular sleep which otherwise would have no reason to stop and would continue with a similar motion world without end and to make it swing sharply round return towards reality travel without pause traverse the regions bordering on life in which presently the sleeper will hear the sounds that come from life quite vague still but already perceptible albeit corrupted — and come to earth suddenly and awake then from those profound slumbers we awake in a dawn not knowing who we are being nobody newly born ready for anything our brain being emptied of that past which was previously our life and perhaps it is more pleasant still when our landing at the wakingpoint is abrupt and the thoughts of our sleep hidden by a cloak of oblivion have not time to return to us in order before sleep ceases then from the black tempest through which we seem to have passed but we do not even saywe we emerge prostrate without a thought a we that is void of content what hammerblow has the person or thing that is lying there received to make it unconscious of anything stupefied until the moment when memory flooding back restores to it consciousness or personality moreover for both these kinds of awakening we must avoid falling asleep even into deep slumber under the law of habit for everything that habit ensnares in her nets she watches closely we must escape her take our sleep at a moment when we thought we were doing anything else than sleeping take in a word a sleep that does not dwell under the tutelage of foresight in the company albeit latent of reflexion at least in these awakenings which i have just described and which i experienced as a rule when i had been dining overnight at la raspelière everything occurred as though by this process and i can testify to it i the strange human being who while he waits for death to release him lives behind closed shutters knows nothing of the world sits motionless as an owl and like that bird begins to see things a little plainly only when darkness falls everything occurs as though by this process but perhaps only a layer of wadding has prevented the sleeper from taking in the internal dialogue of memories and the incessant verbiage of sleep for and this may be equally manifest in the other system vaster more mysterious more astral at the moment of his entering the waking state the sleeper hears a voice inside him saying “will you come to this dinner tonight my dear friend it would be such fun” and thinks “yes what fun it will be i shall go” then growing wider awake he suddenly remembers “my grandmother has only a few weeks to live the doctor assures us” he rings he weeps at the thought that it will not be as in the past his grandmother his dying grandmother but an indifferent waiter that will come in answer to his summons moreover when sleep bore him so far away from the world inhabited by memory and thought through an ether in which he was alone more than alone not having that companion in whom we perceive things ourself he was outside the range of time and its measures but now the footman is in the room and he dares not ask him the time for he does not know whether he has slept for how many hours he has slept he asks himself whether it should not be how many days returning thus with weary body and mind refreshed his heart sick for home as from a journey too distant not to have taken a long time we may of course insist that there is but one time for the futile reason that it is by looking at the clock that we have discovered to have been merely a quarter of an hour what we had supposed a day but at the moment when we make this discovery we are a man awake plunged in the time of waking men we have deserted the other time perhaps indeed more than another time another life the pleasures that we enjoy in sleep we do not include them in the list of the pleasures that we have felt in the course of our existence to allude only to the most grossly sensual of them all which of us on waking has not felt a certain irritation at having experienced in his sleep a pleasure which if he is anxious not to tire himself he is not once he is awake at liberty to repeat indefinitely during the day it seems a positive waste we have had pleasure in another life which is not ours sufferings and pleasures of the dreamworld which generally vanish soon enough after our waking if we make them figure in a budget it is not in the current account of our life

   two times i have said perhaps there is only one after all not that the time of the waking man has any validity for the sleeper but perhaps because the other life the life in which he sleeps is not — in its profounder part — included in the category of time i came to this conclusion when on the mornings after dinners at la raspelière i used to lie so completely asleep for this reason i was beginning to despair on waking when i found that after i had rung the bell ten times the waiter did not appear at the eleventh ring he came it was only the first after all the other ten had been mere suggestions in my sleep which still hung about me of the peal that i had been meaning to sound my numbed hands had never even moved well on those mornings and this is what makes me say that sleep is perhaps unconscious of the law of time my effort to awaken consisted chiefly in an effort to make the obscure undefined mass of the sleep in which i had just been living enter into the scale of time it is no easy task sleep which does not know whether we have slept for two hours or two days cannot provide any indication and if we do not find one outside not being able to reenter time we fall asleep again for five minutes which seem to us three hours

   i have always said — and have proved by experiment — that the most powerful soporific is sleep itself after having slept profoundly for two hours having fought against so many giants and formed so many lifelong friendships it is far more difficult to awake than after taking several grammes of veronal and so reasoning from one thing to the other i was surprised to hear from the norwegian philosopher who had it from m boutroux “my eminent colleague — pardon me my brother” what m bergson thought of the peculiar effects upon the memory of soporific drugs “naturally” m bergson had said to m boutroux if one was to believe the norwegian philosopher “soporifics taken from time to time in moderate doses have no effect upon that solid memory of our everyday life which is so firmly established within us but there are other forms of memory loftier but also more unstable one of my colleagues lectures upon ancient history he tells me that if overnight he has taken a tablet to make him sleep he has great difficulty during his lecture in recalling the greek quotations that he requires the doctor who recommended these tablets assured him that they had no effect upon the memory ‘that is perhaos because you do not have to quote greek’ the historian answered not without a note of derisive pride”

   i cannot say whether this conversation between m bergson and m boutroux is accurately reported the norwegian philosopher albeit so profound and so lucid so passionately attentive may have misunderstood personally in my own experience i have found the opposite result the moments of oblivion that come to us in the morning after we have taken certain narcotics have a resemblance that is only partial though disturbing to the oblivion that reigns during a night of natural and profound sleep now what i find myself forgetting in either case is not some line of baudelaire which on the other hand keeps sounding in my ear it is not some concept of one of the philosophers abovenamed it is the actual reality of the ordinary things that surround me — if i am asleep — my nonperception of which makes me an idiot it is if i am awakened and proceed to emerge from an artificial slumber not the system of porphyry or plotinus which i can discuss as fluently as at any other time but the answer that i have promised to give to an invitation the memory of which is replaced by a universal blank the lofty thought remains in its place what the soporific has put out of action is the power to act in little things in everything that demands activity in order toseize at the right moment to grasp some memory of everyday life in spite of all that may be said about survival after the destruction of the brain i observe that each alteration of the brain is a partial death we possess all our memories but not the faculty of recalling them said echoing m bergson the eminent norwegian philosopher whose language i have made no attempt to imitate in order not to prolong my story unduly but not the faculty of recalling them but what then is a memory which we do not recall or indeed let us go farther we do not recall our memories of the last thirty years but we are wholly steeped in them why then stop short at thirty years why not prolong back to before out birth this anterior life the moment that i do not know a whole section of the memories that are behind me the moment that they are invisible to me that i have not the faculty of calling them to me who can assure me that in that mass unknown to me there are not some that extend back much farther than my human life if i can have in me and round me so many memories which i do not remember this oblivion a de facto oblivion at least since i have not the faculty of seeing anything may extend over a life which i have lived in the body of another man even upon another planet a common oblivion effaces all but what in that case signifies that immortality of the soul the reality of which the norwegian philosopher affirmed the person that i shall be after death has no more reason to remember the man whom i have been since my birth than the latter to remember what i was before it

   the waiter came in i did not mention to him that i had rung several times for i was beginning to realise that hitherto i had only dreamed that i was ringing i was alarmed nevertheless by the thought that this dream had had the clear precision of experience experience would reciprocally have the irreality of a dream

   instead i asked him who it was that had been ringing so often during the night he told me “nobody” and could prove his statement for the bellboard would have registered any ring and yet i could hear the repeated almost furious peals which were still echoing in my ears and were to remain perceptible for several days it is however seldom that sleep thus projects into our waking life memories that do not perish with it we can count these aeroliths if it is an idea that sleep has forged it soon breaks up into slender irrecoverable fragments but in this instance sleep had fashioned sounds more material and simpler they lasted longer i was astonished by the relative earliness of the hour as told me by the waiter i was none the less refreshed it is the light sleeps that have a long duration because being an intermediate state between waking and sleeping preserving a somewhat faded but permanent impression of the former they require infinitely more time to refresh us than a profound sleep which may be short i felt quite comfortable for another reason if remembering that we are tired is enough to make us feel our tiredness saying to oneself “i am refreshed” is enough to create refreshment now i had been dreaming that m de charlus was a hundred and ten years old and had just boxed the ears of his own mother madame verdurin because she had paid five thousand millions for a bunch of violets i was therefore assured that i had slept profoundly had dreamed the reverse of what had been in my thoughts overnight and of all the possibilities of life at the moment this was enough to make me feel entirely refreshed

   i should greatly have astonished my mother who could not understand m de charlus’s assiduity in visiting the verdurins had i told her whom on the very day on which albertine’s toque had been ordered without a word about it to her in order that it might come as a surprise m de charlus had brought to dine in a private room at the grand hotel balbec his guest was none other than the footman of a lady who was a cousin of the cambremers this footman was very smartly dressed and as he crossed the hall with the baron ‘did the man of fashion’ as saintloup would have said in the eyes of the visitors indeed the young pageboys the lévites who were swarming down the temple steps at that moment because it was the time when they came on duty paid no attention to the two strangers one of whom m de charlus kept his eyes lowered to shew that he was paying little if any to them he appeared to be trying to carve his way through their midst “prosper dear hope of a sacred nation” he said recalling a passage from racine and applying to it a wholly different meaning “pardon” asked the footman who was not well up in the classics m de charlus made no reply for he took a certain pride in never answering questions and in marching straight ahead as though there were no other visitors in the hotel or no one existed in the world except himself baron de charlus but having continued to quote the speech of josabeth “come come my children” he felt a revulsion and did not like her add “bid them approach” for these young people had not yet reached the age at which sex is completely developed and which appealed to m de charlus moreover if he had written to madame de chevregny’s footman because he had had no doubt of his docility he had hoped to meet some one more virile on seeing him he found him more effeminate than he would have liked he told him that he had been expecting some one else for he knew by sight another of madame de chevregny’s footmen whom he had noticed upon the box of her carriage this was an extremely rustic type of peasant the very opposite of him who had come who on the other hand regarding his own effeminate ways as adding to his attractiveness and never doubting that it was this manoftheworld air that had captivated m de charlus could not even guess whom the baron meant “but there is no one else in the house except one that you can’t have given the eye to he is hideous just like a great peasant” and at the thought that it was perhaps this rustic whom the baron had seen he felt his selfesteem wounded the baron guessed this and widening his quest “but i have not taken a vow that i will know only mme de chevregny’s men” he said “surely there are plenty of fellows in one house or another here or in paris since you are leaving soon that you could introduce to me” “oh no” replied the footman “i never go with anyone of my own class i only speak to them on duty but there is one very nice person i can make you know” “who” asked the baron “the prince de guermantes” m de guermantes was vexed at being offered only a man so advanced in years one moreover to whom he had no need to apply to a footman for an introduction and so he declined the offer in a dry tone and not letting himself be discouraged by the menial’s social pretensions began to explain to him again what he wanted the style the type a jockey for instance and so on    fearing lest the solicitor who went past at that moment might have heard them he thought it cunning to shew that he was speaking of anything in the world rather than what his hearer might suspect and said with emphasis and in ringing tones but as though he were simply continuing his conversation “yes in spite of my age i still keep up a passion for collecting a passion for pretty things i will do anything to secure an old bronze an early lustre i adore the beautiful” but to make the footman understand the change of subject he had so rapidly executed m de charlus laid such stress upon each word and what was more to be heard by the solicitor he shouted his words so loud that this charade should in itself have been enough to reveal what it concealed from ears more alert than those of the officer of the court he suspected nothing any more than any of the other residents in the hotel all of whom saw a fashionable foreigner in the footman so smartly attired on the other hand if the gentlemen were deceived and took him for a distinguished american no sooner did he appear before the servants than he was spotted by them as one convict recognises another indeed scented afar off as certain animals scent one another the head waiters raised their eyebrows aimé cast a suspicious glance the wine waiter shrugging his shoulders uttered behind his hand because he thought it polite an offensive expression which everybody heard and even our old françoise whose sight was failing and who went past at that moment at the foot of the staircase to dine with the courriers raised her head recognised a servant where the hotel guests never suspected one — as the old nurse euryclea recognises ulysses long before the suitors seated at the banquet — and seeing arm in arm with him m de charlus assumed an appalled expression as though all of a sudden slanders which she had heard repeated and had not believed had acquired a heartrending probability in her eyes she never spoke to me nor to anyone else of this incident but it must have caused a considerable commotion in her brain for afterwards whenever in paris she happened to see ‘julien’ to whom until then she had been so greatly attached she still treated him with politeness but with a politeness that had cooled and was always tempered with a strong dose of reserve this same incident led some one else to confide in me this was aimé when i encountered m de charlus he not having expected to meet me raised his hand and called out “good evening” with the indifference — outwardly at least — of a great nobleman who believes that everything is allowed him and thinks it better not to appear to be hiding anything aimé who at that moment was watching him with a suspicious eye and saw that i greeted the companion of the person in whom he was certain that he detected a servant asked me that same evening who he was for for some time past aimé had shewn a fondness for talking or rather as he himself put it doubtless in order to emphasise the character — philosophical according to him — of these talks ‘discussing’ with me and as i often said to him that it distressed me that he should have to stand beside the table while i ate instead of being able to sit down and share my meal he declared that he had never seen a guest shew such ‘sound reasoning’ he was talking at that moment to two waiters they had bowed to me i did not know why their faces were unfamiliar albeit their conversation sounded a note which seemed to me not to be novel aimé was scolding them both because of their matrimonial engagements of which he disapproved he appealed to me i said that i could not have any opinion on the matter since i did not know them they told me their names reminded me that they had often waited upon me at rivebelle but one had let his moustache grow the other had shaved his off and had had his head cropped and for this reason albeit it was the same head as before that rested upon the shoulders of each of them and not a different head as in the faulty restorations of notredame it had remained almost as invisible to me as those objects which escape the most minute search and are actually staring everybody in the face where nobody notices them on the mantelpiece as soon as i knew their names i recognised exactly the uncertain music of their voices because i saw once more the old face which made it clear “they want to get married and they haven’t even learned english” aimé said to me without reflecting that i was little versed in the ways of hotel service and could not be aware that a person who does not know foreign languages cannot be certain of getting a situation i who supposed that he would have no difficulty in finding out that the newcomer was m de charlus and indeed imagined that he must remember him having waited upon him in the diningroom when the baron came during my former visit to balbec to see mme de villeparisis i told him his name not only did aimé not remember the baron de charlus but the name appeared to make a profound impression upon him he told me that he would look for a letter next day in his room which i might perhaps be able to explain to him i was all the more astonished in that m de charlus when he had wished to give me one of bergotte’s books at balbec the other year had specially asked for aimé whom he must have recognised later on in that paris restaurant where i had taken luncheon with saintloup and his mistress and where m de charlus had come to spy upon us it is true that aimé had not been able to execute these commissions in person being on the former occasion in bed and on the latter engaged in waiting i had nevertheless grave doubts as to his sincerity when he pretended not to know m de charlus for one thing he must have appealed to the baron like all the upstairs waiters of the balbec hotel like several of the prince de guermantes’s footmen aimé belonged to a race more ancient than that of the prince therefore more noble when you asked for a sittingroom you thought at first that you were alone but presently in the serviceroom you caught sight of a sculptural waiter of that ruddy etruscan kind of which aimé was typical slightly aged by excessive consumption of champagne and seeing the inevitable hour approach for contrexéville water not all the visitors asked them merely to wait upon them the underlings who were young conscientious busy who had mistresses waiting for them outside made off whereupon aimé reproached them with not being serious he had every right to do so he himself was serious he had a wife and children and was ambitious on their behalf and so the advances made to him by a strange lady or gentleman he never repulsed though it meant his staying all night for business must come before everything he was so much of the type that attracted m de charlus that i suspected him of falsehood when he told me that he did not know him i was wrong the page had been perfectly truthful when he told the baron that aimé who had given him a dressingdown for it next day had gone to bed or gone out and on the other occasion was busy waiting but imagination outreaches reality and the pageboy’s embarrassment had probably aroused in m de charlus doubts as to the sincerity of his excuses that had wounded sentiments of which aimé had no suspicion we have seen moreover that saintloup had prevented aimé from going out to the carriage in which m de charlus who had managed somehow or other to discover the waiter’s new address received a further disappointment aimé who had not noticed him felt an astonishment that may be imagined when on the evening of that very day on which i had taken luncheon with saintloup and his mistress he received a letter sealed with the guermantes arms from which i shall quote a few passages here as an example of unilateral insanity in an intelligent man addressing an imbecile endowed with sense “sir i have been unsuccessful notwithstanding efforts that would astonish many people who have sought in vain to be greeted and welcomed by myself in persuading you to listen to certain explanations which you have not asked of me but which i have felt it to be incumbent upon my dignity and your own to offer you i am going therefore to write down here what it would have been more easy to say to you in person i shall not conceal from you that the first time that i set eyes upon you at balbec i found your face frankly antipathetic” here followed reflexions upon the resemblance — remarked only on the following day — to a deceased friend to whom m de charlus had been deeply attached “the thought then suddenly occurred to me that you might without in any way encroaching upon the demands of your profession come to see me and by joining me in the card games with which his mirth used to dispel my gloom give me the illusion that he was not dead whatever the nature of the more or less fatuous suppositions which you probably formed suppositions more within the mental range of a servant who does not even deserve the name of servant since he has declined to serve than the comprehension of so lofty a sentiment you probably thought that you were giving yourself importance knowing not who i was nor what i was by sending word to me when i asked you to fetch me a book that you were in bed but it is a mistake to imagine that impolite behaviour ever adds to charm in which you moreover are entirely lacking i should have ended matters there had i not by chance the following morning found an opportunity of speaking to you your resemblance to my poor friend was so accentuated banishing even the intolerable protuberance of your too prominent chin that i realised that it was the deceased who at that moment was lending you his own kindly expression so as to permit you to regain your hold over me and to prevent you from missing the unique opportunity that was being offered you indeed although i have no wish since there is no longer any object and it is unlikely that i shall meet you again in this life to introduce coarse questions of material interest i should have been only too glad to obey the prayer of my dead friend for i believe in the communion of saints and in their deliberate intervention in the destiny of the living that i should treat you as i used to treat him who had his carriage his servants and to whom it was quite natural that i should consecrate the greater part of my fortune since i loved him as a father loves his son you have decided otherwise to my request that you should fetch me a book you sent the reply that you were obliged to go out and this morning when i sent to ask you to come to my carriage you then if i may so speak without blasphemy denied me for the third time you will excuse my not enclosing in this envelope the lavish gratuity which i intended to give you at balbec and to which it would be too painful to me to restrict myself in dealing with a person with whom i had thought for a moment of sharing all that i possess at least you might spare me the trouble of making a fourth vain attempt to find you at your restaurant to which my patience will not extend” here m de charlus gave his address stated the hours at which he would be at home etc “farewell sir since i assume that resembling so strongly the friend whom i have lost you cannot be entirely stupid otherwise physiognomy would be a false science i am convinced that if one day you think of this incident again it will not be without feeling some regret and some remorse for my part believe that i am quite sincere in saying that i retain no bitterness i should have preferred that we should part with a less unpleasant memory than this third futile endeavour it will soon be forgotten we are like those vessels which you must often have seen at balbec which have crossed one another’s course for a moment it might have been to the advantage of each of them to stop but one of them has decided otherwise presently they will no longer even see one another on the horizon and their meeting is a thing out of mind but before this final parting each of them salutes the other and so at this point sir wishing you all good fortune does

   the baron de charlus”

   aimé had not even read this letter through being able to make nothing of it and suspecting a hoax when i had explained to him who the baron was he appeared to be lost in thought and to be feeling the regret that m de charlus had anticipated i would not be prepared to swear that he would not at that moment have written a letter of apology to a man who gave carriages to his friends but in the interval m de charlus had made morel’s acquaintance it was true that his relations with morel being possibly platonic m de charlus occasionally sought to spend an evening in company such as that in which i had just met him in the hall but he was no longer able to divert from morel the violent sentiment which at liberty a few years earlier had asked nothing better than to fasten itself upon aimé and had dictated the letter which had distressed me for its writer’s sake when the head waiter shewed me it it was in view of the antisocial nature of m de charlus’s love a more striking example of the insensible sweeping force of these currents of passion by which the lover like a swimmer is very soon carried out of sight of land no doubt the love of a normal man may also when the lover by the successive invention of his desires regrets disappointments plans constructs a whole romance about a woman whom he does not know allow the two legs of the compass to gape at a quite remarkably wide angle all the same such an angle was singularly enlarged by the character of a passion which is not generally shared and by the difference in social position between m de charlus and aime
   every day i went out with albertine she had decided to take up painting again and had chosen as the subject of her first attempts the church of saintjean de la haise which nobody ever visited and very few had even heard of a spot difficult to describe impossible to discover without a guide slow of access in its isolation more than half an hour from the epreville station after one had long left behind one the last houses of the village of quetteholme as to the name epreville i found that the curé‘s book and brichot’s information were at variance according to one epreville was the ancient sprevilla the other derived the name from aprivilla on our first visit we took a little train in the opposite direction from féterne that is to say towards grattevast but we were in the dog days and it had been a terrible strain simply to go out of doors immediately after luncheon i should have preferred not to start so soon the luminous and burning air provoked thoughts of indolence and cool retreats it filled my mother’s room and mine according to their exposure at varying temperatures like rooms in a turkish bath mamma’s dressingroom festooned by the sun with a dazzling moorish whiteness appeared to be sunk at the bottom of a well because of the four plastered walls on which it looked out while far above in the empty space the sky whose fleecy white waves one saw slip past one behind another seemed because of the longing that one felt whether built upon a terrace or seen reversed in a mirror hung above the window a tank filled with blue water reserved for bathers notwithstanding this scorching temperature we had taken the one o’clock train but albertine had been very hot in the carriage hotter still in the long walk across country and i was afraid of her catching cold when she proceeded to sit still in that damp hollow where the sun’s rays did not penetrate having on the other hand as long ago as our first visits to elstir made up my mind that she would appreciate not merely luxury but even a certain degree of comfort of which her want of money deprived her i had made arrangements with a balbec jobmaster that a carriage was to be sent every day to take us out to escape from the heat we took the road through the forest of chantepie the invisibility of the innumerable birds some of them almost seabirds that conversed with one another from the trees on either side of us gave the same impression of repose that one has when one shuts one’s eyes by albertine’s side enchained by her arms within the carriage i listened to these oceanides and when by chance i caught sight of one of these musicians as he flitted from one leaf to the shelter of another there was so little apparent connexion between him and his songs that i could not believe that i beheld their cause in the little body fluttering humble startled and unseeing the carriage could not take us all the way to the church i stopped it when we had passed through quetteholme and bade albertine goodbye for she had alarmed me by saying to me of this church as of other buildings of certain pictures “what a pleasure it would be to see that with you” this pleasure was one that i did not feel myself capable of giving her i felt it myself in front of beautiful things only if i was alone or pretended to be alone and did not speak but since she supposed that she might thanks to me feel sensations of art which are not communicated thus — i thought it more prudent to say that i must leave her would come back to fetch her at the end of the day but that in the meantime i must go back with the carriage to pay a call on mme verdurin or on the cambremers or even spend an hour with mamma at balbec but never farther afield to begin with that is to say for albertine having once said to me petulantly “it’s a bore that nature has arranged things so badly and put saintjean de la haise in one direction la raspelière in another so that you’re imprisoned for the whole day in the part of the country you’ve chosen” as soon as the toque and veil had come i ordered to my eventual undoing a motorcar from saintfargeau sanctus ferreolus according to the curé‘s book albertine whom i had kept in ignorance and who had come to call for me was surprised when she heard in front of the hotel the purr of the engine delighted when she learned that this motor was for ourselves i made her come upstairs for a moment to my room she jumped for joy “we are going to pay a call on the verdurins” “yes but you’d better not go dressed like that since you are going to have your motor there you will look better in these” and i brought out the toque and veil which i had hidden “they’re for me oh you are an angel” she cried throwing her arms round my neck aimé who met us on the stairs proud of albertine’s smart attire and of our means of transport for these vehicles were still comparatively rare at balbec gave himself the pleasure of coming downstairs behind us albertine anxious to display herself in her new garments asked me to have the car opened as we could shut it later on when we wished to be more private “now then” said aimé to the driver with whom he was not acquainted and who had not stirred “don’t you tu hear you’re to open your roof” for aimé sophisticated by hotel life in which moreover he had won his way to exalted rank was not as shy as the cab driver to whom françoise was a ‘lady’ notwithstanding the want of any formal introduction plebeians whom he had never seen before he addressed as tu though it was hard to say whether this was aristocratic disdain on his part or democratic fraternity “i am engaged” replied the chauffeur who did not know me by sight “i am ordered for mlle simonet i can’t take this gentleman” aimé burst out laughing “why you great pumpkin” he said to the driver whom he at once convinced “this is mademoiselle simonet and monsieur who tells you to open the roof of your car is the person who has engaged you” and as aimé although personally he had no feeling for albertine was for my sake proud of the garments she was wearing he whispered to the chauffeur “don’t get the chance of driving a princess like that every day do you” on this first occasion it was not i alone that was able to go to la raspelière as i did on other days while albertine painted she decided to go there with me she did indeed think that we might stop here and there on our way but supposed it to be impossible to start by going to saintjean de la haise that is to say in another direction and to make an excursion which seemed to be reserved for a different day she learned on the contrary from the driver that nothing could be easier than to go to saintjean which he could do in twenty minutes and that we might stay there if we chose for hours or go on much farther for from quetteholme to la raspelière would not take more than thirtyfive minutes we realised this as soon as the vehicle starting off covered in one bound twenty paces of an excellent horse distances are only the relation of space to time and vary with that relation we express the difficulty that we have in getting to a place in a system of miles or kilometres which becomes false as soon as that difficulty decreases art is modified by it also when a village which seemed to be in a different world from some other village becomes its neighbour in a landscape whose dimensions are altered in any case the information that there may perhaps exist a universe in which two and two make five and the straight line is not the shortest way between two points would have astonished albertine far less than to hear the driver say that it was easy to go in a single afternoon to saintjean and la raspelière douville and quetteholme saintmars le vieux and saintmars le vêtu gourville and old balbec tourville and féterne prisoners hitherto as hermetically confined in the cells of distinct days as long ago were méséglise and guermantes upon which the same eyes could not gaze in the course of one afternoon delivered now by the giant with the sevenleague boots came and clustered about our teatime their towers and steeples their old gardens which the encroaching wood sprang back to reveal

   coming to the foot of the cliff road the car took it in its stride with a continuous sound like that of a knife being ground while the sea falling away grew broader beneath us the old rustic houses of montsurvent ran towards us clasping to their bosoms vine or rosebush the firs of la raspelière more agitated than when the evening breeze was rising ran in every direction to escape from us and a new servant whom i had never seen before came to open the door for us on the terrace while the gardener’s son betraying a precocious bent devoured the machine with his gaze as it was not a monday we did not know whether we should find mme verdurin for except upon that day when he was at home it was unsafe to call upon her without warning no doubt she was ‘principally’ at home but this expression which mme swann employed at the time when she too was seeking to form her little clan and to draw visitors to herself without moving towards them an expression which she interpreted as meaning ‘on principle’ meant no more than ‘as a general rule’ that is to say with frequent exceptions for not only did mme verdurin like going out but she carried her duties as a hostess to extreme lengths and when she had had people to luncheon immediately after the coffee liqueurs and cigarettes notwithstanding the first somnolent effects of the heat and of digestion in which they would have preferred to watch through the leafy boughs of the terrace the jersey packet passing over the enamelled sea the programme included a series of excursions in the course of which her guests installed by force in carriages were conveyed willynilly to look at one or other of the views that abound in the neighbourhood of douville

   this second part of the entertainment was as it happened once the effort to rise and enter the carriage had been made no less satisfactory than the other to the guests already prepared by the succulent dishes the vintage wines or sparkling cider to let themselves be easily intoxicated by the purity of the breeze and the magnificence of the views mme verdurin used to make strangers visit these rather as though they were portions more or less detached of her property which you could not help going to see the moment you came to luncheon with her and which conversely you would never have known had you not been entertained by the mistress this claim to arrogate to herself the exclusive right over walks and drives as over morel’s and formerly dechambre’s playing and to compel the landscapes to form part of the little clan was not for that matter so absurd as it appears at first sight mme verdurin deplored the want of taste which according to her the cambremers shewed in the furnishing of la raspelière and the arrangement of the garden but still more their want of initiative in the excursions that they took or made their guests take in the surrounding country just as according to her la raspelière was only beginning to become what it should always have been now that it was the asylum of the little clan so she insisted that the cambremers perpetually exploring in their barouche along the railway line by the shore the one ugly road that there was in the district had been living in the place all their lives but did not know it there was a grain of truth in this assertion from force of habit lack of imagination want of interest in a country which seemed hackneyed because it was so near the cambremers when they left their home went always to the same places and by the same roads to be sure they laughed heartily at the verdurins’ offer to shew them their native country but when it came to that they and even their coachman would have been incapable of taking us to the splendid more or less secret places to which m verdurin brought us now forcing the barrier of a private but deserted property upon which other people would not have thought it possible to venture now leaving the carriage to follow a path which was not wide enough for wheeled traffic but in either case with the certain recompense of a marvellous view let us say in passing that the garden at la raspelière was in a sense a compendium of all the excursions to be made in a radius of many miles for one thing because of its commanding position overlooking on one side the valley on the other the sea and also because on one and the same side the seaward side for instance clearings had been made through the trees in such a way that from one point you embraced one horizon from another another there was at each of these points of view a bench you went and sat down in turn upon the bench from which there was the view of balbec or parville or douville even to command a single view one bench would have been placed more or less on the edge of the cliff another farther back from the latter you had a foreground of verdure and a horizon which seemed already the vastest imaginable but which became infinitely larger if continuing along a little path you went to the next bench from which you scanned the whole amphitheatre of the sea there you could make out exactly the sound of the waves which did not penetrate to the more secluded parts of the garden where the sea was still visible but no longer audible these restingplaces bore at la raspelière among the occupants of the house the name of ‘views’ and indeed they assembled round the mansion the finest views of the neighbouring places coastline or forest seen greatly diminished by distance as hadrian collected in his villa reduced models of the most famous monuments of different countries the name that followed the word ‘view’ was not necessarily that of a place on the coast but often that of the opposite shore of the bay which you could make out standing out in a certain relief notwithstanding the extent of the panorama just as you took a book from m verdurin’s library to go and read for an hour at the ‘view of balbec’ so if the sky was clear the liqueurs would be served at the ‘view of rivebelle’ on condition however that the wind was not too strong for in spite of the trees planted on either side the air up there was keen to come back to the carriage parties that mme verdurin used to organise for the afternoons the mistress if on her return she found the cards of some social butterfly ‘on a flying visit to the coast’ would pretend to be overjoyed but was actually brokenhearted at having missed his visit and albeit people at this date came only to ‘see the house’ or to make the acquaintance for a day of a woman whose artistic salon was famous but outside the pale in paris would at once make m verdurin invite him to dine on the following wednesday as the tourist was often obliged to leave before that day or was afraid to be out late mme verdurin had arranged that on mondays she was always to be found at teatime these teaparties were not at all large and i had known more brilliant gatherings of the sort in paris at the princesse de guermantes’s at mme de gallifet’s or mme d’arpajon’s but this was not paris and the charm of the setting enhanced in my eyes not merely the pleasantness of the party but the merits of the visitors a meeting with some social celebrity which in paris would have given me no pleasure but which at la raspelière whither he had come from a distance by féterne or the forest of chantepie changed in character in importance became an agreeable incident sometimes it was a person whom i knew quite well and would not have gone a yard to meet at the swanns’ but his name sounded differently upon this cliff like the name of an actor whom one has constantly heard in a theatre printed upon the announcement in a different colour of an extraordinary gala performance where his notoriety is suddenly multiplied by the unexpectedness of the rest as in the country people behave without ceremony the social celebrity often took it upon him to bring the friends with whom he was staying murmuring the excuse in mme verdurin’s ear that he could not leave them behind as he was living in their house to his hosts on the other hand he pretended to offer as a sort of courtesy the distraction in a monotonous seaside life of being taken to a centre of wit and intellect of visiting a magnificent mansion and of making an excellent tea this composed at once an assembly of several persons of semidistinction and if a little slice of garden with a few trees which would seem shabby in the country acquires an extraordinary charm in the avenue gabriel or let us say the rue de monceau where only multimillionaires can afford such a luxury inversely gentlemen who are of secondary importance at a parisian party stood out at their full value on a monday afternoon at la raspelière no sooner did they sit down at the table covered with a cloth embroidered in red beneath the painted panels to partake of the rock cakes norman puff pastry tartlets shaped like boats filled with cherries like beads of coral ‘diplomatic’ cakes than these guests were subjected by the proximity of the great bowl of azure upon which the window opened and which you could not help seeing when you looked at them to a profound alteration a transmutation which changed them into something more precious than before what was more even before you set eyes on them when you came on a monday to mme verdurin’s people who in paris would scarcely turn their heads to look so familiar was the sight of a string of smart carriages waiting outside a great house felt their hearts throb at the sight of the two or three brokendown dogcarts drawn up in front of la raspelière beneath the tall firs no doubt this was because the rustic setting was different and social impressions thanks to this transposition regained a kind of novelty it was also because the brokendown carriage that one hired to pay a call upon mme verdurin called to mind a pleasant drive and a costly bargain struck with a coachman who had demanded ‘so much’ for the whole day but the slight stir of curiosity with regard to fresh arrivals whom it was still impossible to distinguish made everybody ask himself “who can this be” a question which it was difficult to answer when one did not know who might have come down to spend a week with the cambremers or elsewhere but which people always enjoy putting to themselves in rustic solitary lives where a meeting with a human creature whom one has not seen for a long time ceases to be the tiresome affair that it is in the life of paris and forms a delicious break in the empty monotony of lives that are too lonely in which even the postman’s knock becomes a pleasure and on the day on which we arrived in a motorcar at la raspelière as it was not monday m and mme verdurin must have been devoured by that craving to see people which attacks men and women and inspires a longing to throw himself out of the window in the patient who has been shut up away from his family and friends for a cure of strict isolation for the new and more swiftfooted servant who had already made himself familiar with these expressions having replied that “if madame has not gone out she must be at the view of douville” and that he would go and look for her came back immediately to tell us that she was coming to welcome us we found her slightly dishevelled for she came from the flower beds farmyard and kitchen garden where she had gone to feed her peacocks and poultry to hunt for eggs to gather fruit and flowers to ‘make her tablecentre’ which would suggest her park in miniature but on the table it conferred the distinction of making it support the burden of only such things as were useful and good to eat for round those other presents from the garden which were the pears the whipped eggs rose the tall stems of bugloss carnations roses and coreopsis between which one saw as between blossoming boundary posts move from one to another beyond the glazed windows the ships at sea from the astonishment which m and mme verdurin interrupted while arranging their flowers to receive the visitors that had been announced shewed upon finding that these visitors were merely albertine and myself it was easy to see that the new servant full of zeal but not yet familiar with my name had repeated it wrongly and that mme verdurin hearing the names of guests whom she did not know had nevertheless bidden him let them in in her need of seeing somebody no matter whom and the new servant stood contemplating this spectacle from the door in order to learn what part we played in the household then he made off at a run taking long strides for he had entered upon his duties only the day before when albertine had quite finished displaying her toque and veil to the verdurins she gave me a warning look to remind me that we had not too much time left for what we meant to do mme verdurin begged us to stay to tea but we refused when all of a sudden a suggestion was mooted which would have made an end of all the pleasures that i promised myself from my drive with albertine the mistress unable to face the thought of tearing herself from us or perhaps of allowing a novel distraction to escape decided to accompany us accustomed for years past to the experience that similar offers on her part were not well received and being probably dubious whether this offer would find favour with us she concealed beneath an excessive assurance the timidity that she felt when addressing us and without even appearing to suppose that there could be any doubt as to our answer asked us no question but said to her husband speaking of albertine and myself as though she were conferring a favour on us “i shall see them home myself” at the same time there hovered over her lips a smile that did not belong to them a smile which i had already seen on the faces of certain people when they said to bergotte with a knowledgeable air “i have bought your book it’s not bad” one of those collective universal smiles which when they feel the need of them — as we make use of railways and removal vans — individuals borrow except a few who are extremely refined like swann or m de charlus on whose lips i have never seen that smile settle from that moment my visit was poisoned i pretended not to have understood a moment later it became evident that m verdurin was to be one of the party “but it will be too far for m verdurin” i objected “not at all” replied mme verdurin with a condescending cheerful air “he says it will amuse him immensely to go with you young people over a road he has travelled so many times if necessary he will sit beside the engineer that doesn’t frighten him and we shall come back quietly by the train like a good married couple look at him he’s quite delighted” she seemed to be speaking of an aged and famous painter full of friendliness who younger than the youngest takes a delight in scribbling figures on paper to make his grandchildren laugh what added to my sorrow was that albertine seemed not to share it and to find some amusement in the thought of dashing all over the countryside like this with the verdurins as for myself the pleasure that i had vowed that i would take with her was so imperious that i refused to allow the mistress to spoil it i invented falsehoods which the irritating threats of mme verdurin made excusable but which albertine alas contradicted “but we have a call to pay” i said “what call” asked albertine “you shall hear about it later there’s no getting out of it” “very well we can wait outside” said mme verdurin resigned to anything at the last minute my anguish at seeing wrested from me a happiness for which i had so longed gave me the courage to be impolite i refused point blank alleging in mme verdurin’s ear that because of some trouble which had befallen albertine and about which she wished to consult me it was absolutely necessary that i should be alone with her the mistress appeared vexed “all right we shan’t come” she said to me in a voice tremulous with rage i felt her to be so angry that so as to appear to be giving way a little “but we might perhaps    ” i began “no” she replied more furious than ever “when i say no i mean no” i supposed that i was out of favour with her but she called us back at the door to urge us not to ‘fail’ on the following wednesday and not to come with that contraption which was dangerous at night but by the train with the little group and she made me stop the car which was moving down hill across the park because the footman had forgotten to put in the hood the slice of tart and the shortbread which she had had made into a parcel for us we started off escorted for a moment by the little houses that came running to meet us with their flowers the face of the countryside seemed to us entirely changed so far in the topographical image that we form in our minds of separate places is the notion of space from being the most important factor we have said that the notion of time segregates them even farther it is not the only factor either certain places which we see always in isolation seem to us to have no common measure with the rest to be almost outside the world like those people whom we have known in exceptional periods of our life during our military service in our childhood and whom we associate with nothing in my first year at balbec there was a piece of high ground to which mme de villeparisis liked to take us because from it you saw only the water and the woods and which was called beaumont as the road that she took to approach it and preferred to other routes because of its old trees went up hill all the way her carriage was obliged to go at a crawling pace and took a very long time when we reached the top we used to alight stroll about for a little get into the carriage again return by the same road without seeing a single village a single country house i knew that beaumont was something very special very remote very high i had no idea of the direction in which it was to be found having never taken the beaumont road to go anywhere else besides it took a very long time to get there in a carriage it was obviously in the same department or in the same province as balbec but was situated for me on another plane enjoyed a special privilege of extraterritoriality but the motorcar respects no mystery and having passed beyond incarville whose houses still danced before my eyes as we were going down the cross road that leads to parville paterni villa catching sight of the sea from a natural terrace over which we were passing i asked the name of the place and before the chauffeur had time to reply recognised beaumont close by which i passed thus unconsciously whenever i took the little train for it was within two minutes of parville like an officer of my regiment who might have seemed to me a creature apart too kindly and simple to be of a great family too remote already and mysterious to be simply of a great family and of whom i was afterwards to learn that he was the brotherinlaw the cousin of people with whom i was dining so beaumont suddenly brought in contact with places from which i supposed it to be so distinct lost its mystery and took its place in the district making me think with terror that madame bovary and the sanseverina might perhaps have seemed to me to be like ordinary people had i met them elsewhere than in the close atmosphere of a novel it may be thought that my love of magic journeys by train ought to have prevented me from sharing albertine’s wonder at the motorcar which takes even the invalid wherever he wishes to go and destroys our conception — which i had held hitherto — of position in space as the individual mark the irreplaceable essence of irremovable beauties and no doubt this position in space was not to the motorcar as it had been to the railway train when i came from paris to balbec a goal exempt from the contingencies of ordinary life almost ideal at the moment of departure and as it remains so at that of arrival at our arrival in that great dwelling where no one dwells and which bears only the name of the town the station seeming to promise at last the accessibility of the town as though the station were its materialisation no the motorcar did not convey us thus by magic into a town which we saw at first in the whole that is summarised by ite name and with the illusions of a spectator in a theatre it made us enter that theatre by the wings which were the streets stopped to ask the way of an inhabitant but as a compensation for so familiar a progress one has the gropings of the chauffeur uncertain of his way and retracing his course the ‘general post’ of perspective which sets a castle dancing about with a hill a church and the sea while one draws nearer to it in spite of its vain efforts to hide beneath its primeval foliage those ever narrowing circles which the motorcar describes round a spellbound town which darts off in every direction to escape it and upon which finally it drops down straight into the heart of the valley where it lies palpitating on the ground so that this position in space this unique point which the motorcar seems to have stripped of the mystery of express trains it gives us on the contrary the impression of discovering of determining for ourselves as with a compass of helping us to feel with a more fondly exploring hand with a finer precision the true geometry the fair measure of the earth

   what unfortunately i did not know at that moment and did not learn until more than two years later was that one of the chauffeur’s patrons was m de charlus and that morel instructed to pay him and keeping part of the money for himself making the chauffeur triple and quintuple the mileage had become very friendly with him while pretending not to know him before other people and made use of his car for long journeys if i had known this at the time and that the confidence which the verdurins were presently to feel in this chauffeur came unknown to them from that source perhaps many of the sorrows of my life in paris in the year that followed much of my trouble over albertine would have been avoided but i had not the slightest suspicion of it in themselves m de charlus’s excursions by motorcar with morel were of no direct interest to me they were moreover confined as a rule to a luncheon or dinner in some restaurant along the coast where m de charlus was regarded as an old and penniless servant and morel whose duty it was to pay the bill as a too kindhearted gentleman i report the conversation at one of these meals which may give an idea of the others it was in a restaurant of elongated shape at saintmars le vêtu “can’t you get them to remove this thing” m de charlus asked morel as though appealing to an intermediary without having to address the staff directly ‘this thing’ was a vase containing three withered roses with which a wellmeaning head waiter had seen fit to decorate the table “yes    ” said morel in embarrassment “you don’t like roses” “my request ought on the contrary to prove that i do like them since there are no roses here” morel appeared surprised “but as a matter of fact i do not care much for them i am rather sensitive to names and whenever a rose is at all beautiful one learns that it is called baronne de rothschild or maréchale niel which casts a chill do you like names have you found beautiful titles for your little concert numbers” “there is one that is called poème triste” “that is horrible” replied m de charlus in a shrill voice that rang out like a blow “but i ordered champagne” he said to the head waiter who had supposed he was obeying the order by placing by the diners two glasses of foaming liquid “yes sir” “take away that filth which has no connexion with the worst champagne in the world it is the emetic known as cup which consists as a rule of three rotten strawberries swimming in a mixture of vinegar and sodawater yes” he went on turning again to morel “you don’t seem to know what a title is and even in the interpretation of the things you play best you seem not to be aware of the mediumistic side” “you mean to say” asked morel who not having understood one word of what the baron had said was afraid that he might be missing something of importance such as an invitation to luncheon m de charlus having failed to regard “you mean to say” as a question morel having in consequence received no answer thought it best to change the conversation and to give it a sensual turn “there look at the fair girl selling the flowers you don’t like i’m certain she’s got a little mistress and the old woman dining at the table at the end too” “but how do you know all that” asked m de charlus amazed at morel’s intuition “oh i can spot them in an instant if we went out together in a crowd you would see that i never make a mistake” and anyone looking at morel at that moment with his girlish air enshrined in his masculine beauty would have understood the obscure divination which made him no less obvious to certain women than them to him he was anxious to supplant jupien vaguely desirous of adding to his regular income the profits which he supposed the tailor derived from the baron “and with boys i am surer still i could save you from making any mistake we shall be having the fair soon at balbec we shall find lots of things there and in paris too you’ll see you’ll have a fine time” but the inherited caution of a servant made him give a different turn to the sentence on which he had already embarked so that m de charlus supposed that he was still referring to girls “listen” said morel anxious to excite in a fashion which he considered less compromising for himself albeit it was actually more immoral the baron’s senses “what i should like would be to find a girl who was quite pure make her fall in love with me and take her virginity” m de charlus could not refrain from pinching morel’s ear affectionately but added innocently “what good would that be to you if you took her maidenhead you would be obliged to marry her” “marry her” cried morel guessing that the baron was fuddled or else giving no thought to the man more scrupulous in reality than he supposed to whom he was speaking “marry her balls i should promise but once the little operation was performed i should clear out and leave her” m de charlus was in the habit when a fiction was capable of causing him a momentary sensual pleasure of believing in its truth while keeping himself free to withdraw his credulity altogether a minute later when his pleasure was at an end “you would really do that” he said to morel with a laugh squeezing him more tightly still “and why not” said morel seeing that he was not shocking the baron by continuing to expound to him what was indeed one of his desires “it is dangerous” said m de charlus “i should have my kit packed and ready and buzz off and leave no address” “and what about me” asked m de charlus “i should take you with me of course” morel made haste to add never having thought of what would become of the baron who was the least of his responsibilities “i say there’s a kid i should love to try that game on she’s a little seamstress who keeps a shop in m le due’s hôtel” “jupien’s girl” the baron exclaimed as the winewaiter entered the room “oh never” he added whether because the presence of a third person had cooled his ardour or because even in this sort of black mass in which he took a delight in defiling the most sacred things he could not bring himself to allow the mention of people to whom he was bound by ties of friendship “jupien is a good man the child is charming it would be a shame to make them unhappy” morel felt that he had gone too far and was silent but his gaze continued to fix itself in imagination upon the girl for whose benefit he had once begged me to address him as ‘dear great master’ and from whom he had ordered a waistcoat an industrious worker the child had not taken any holiday but i learned afterwards that while the violinist was in the neighbourhood of balbec she never ceased to think of his handsome face ennobled by the accident that having seen morel in my company she had taken him for a ‘gentleman’

    “i never heard chopin play” said the baron “and yet i might have done so i took lessons from stamati but he forbade me to go and hear the master of the nocturnes at my aunt chimay’s” “that was damned silly of him” exclaimed morel “on the contrary” m de charlus retorted warmly in a shrill voice “he shewed his intelligence he had realised that i had a ‘nature’ and that i would succumb to chopin’s influence it made no difference because when i was quite young i gave up music and everything else for that matter besides one can more or less imagine him” he added in a slow nasal drawling tone “there are still people who did hear him who can give you an idea however chopin was only an excuse to come back to the mediumistic aspect which you are neglecting”

   the reader will observe that after an interpolation of common parlance m de charlus had suddenly become as precious and haughty in his speech as ever the idea of morel’s ‘dropping’ without compunction a girl whom he had outraged had given him a sudden and entire pleasure from that moment his sensual appetites were satisfied for a time and the sadist a true medium he if you like who had for a few moments taken the place of m de charlus had fled leaving a clear field for the real m de charlus full of artistic refinement sensibility goodness “you were playing the other day the transposition for the piano of the fifteenth quartet which is absurd in itself because nothing could be less pianistic it is meant for people whose ears are hurt by the too highly strained chords of the glorious deaf one whereas it is precisely that almost bitter mysticism that is divine in any case you played it very badly and altered all the movements you ought to play it as though you were composing it the young morel afflicted with a momentary deafness and with a nonexistent genius stands for an instant motionless then seized by the divine frenzy he plays he composes the opening bars after which exhausted by this initial effort he gives way letting droop his charming forelock to please mme verdurîn and what is more gives himself time to recreate the prodigious quantity of grey matter which he has commandeered for the pythian objectivation then having regained his strength seized by a fresh and overmastering inspiration he flings himself upon the sublime imperishable phrase which the virtuoso of berlin” we suppose m de charlus to have meant by this expression mendelssohn “was to imitate without ceasing it is in this the only really transcendent and animating fashion that i shall make you play in paris” when m de charlus gave him advice of this sort morel was far more alarmed than when he saw the head waiter remove his scorned roses and ‘cup’ for he asked himself with anxiety what effect it would create among his ‘class’ but he was unable to dwell upon these reflexions for m de charlus said to him imperiously “ask the head waiter if he has a bon chrétien” “a good christian i don’t understand” “can’t you see we’ve reached the dessert it’s a pear you may be sure mme de cambremer has them in her garden for the comtesse d’escarbagnas whose double she is had them m thibaudier sends her them saying ‘here is a bon chrétien which is worth tasting’” “no i didn’t know” “i can see that you know nothing if you have never even read molière    oh well since you are no more capable of ordering food than of anything else ask simply for a pear which is grown in this neighbourhood the louisebonne d’avranches” “the” “wait a minute since you are so stupid i shall ask him myself for others which i prefer waiter have you any doyennée des cornices charlie you must read the exquisite passage about that pear by the duchesse emilie de clermonttonnerre” “no sir there aren’t any” “have you triomphe de jodoigne” “no sir” “any virginiedallet or passecolmar no very well since you’ve nothing we may as well go the duchesse d’angoulême is not in season yet come along charlie” unfortunately for m de charlus his want of common sense perhaps too the chastity of what were probably his relations with morel made him go out of his way at this period to shower upon the violinist strange bounties which the other was incapable of understanding and to which his nature impulsive in its own way but mean and ungrateful could respond only by a harshness or a violence that were steadily intensified and plunged m de charlus — formerly so proud now quite timid — in fits of genuine despair we shall see how in the smallest matters morel who fancied himself a m de charlus a thousand times more important completely misunderstood by taking it literally the baron’s arrogant information with regard to the aristocracy let us for the moment say simply this while albertine waits for me at saintjean de la haise that if there was one thing which morel set above nobility and this was in itself distinctly noble especially in a person whose pleasure was to pursue little girls — on the sly — with the chauffeur it was his artistic reputation and what the others might think of him in the violin class no doubt it was an ugly trait in his character that because he felt m de charlus to be entirely devoted to him he appeared to disown him to make fun of him in the same way as when i had promised not to reveal the secret of his father’s position with my greatuncle he treated me with contempt but on the other hand his name as that of a recognised artist morel appeared to him superior to a ‘name’ and when m de charlus in his dreams of platonic affection tried to make him adopt one of his family titles morel stoutly refused

   when albertine thought it better to remain at saintjean de la haise and paint i would take the car and it was not merely to gourville and féterne but to saintmars le vêtu and as far as criquetot that i was able to penetrate before returning to fetch her while pretending to be occupied with anything rather than herself and to be obliged to forsake her for other pleasures i thought only of her as often as not i went no farther than the great plain which overlooks gourville and as it resembles slightly the plain that begins above combray in the direction of méséglise even at a considerable distance from albertine i had the joy of thinking that if my gaze could not reach her still travelling farther than in my vision that strong and gentle sea breeze which was sweeping past me must be flowing down without anything to arrest it as far as quetteholme until it stirred the branches of the trees that bury saintjean de la haise in their foliage caressing the face of my mistress and must thus be extending a double tie between her and myself in this retreat indefinitely enlarged but without danger as in those games in which two children find themselves momentarily out of sight and earshot of one another and yet while far apart remain together i returned by those roads from which there is a view of the sea and on which in the past before it appeared among the branches i used to shut my eyes to reflect that what i was going to see was indeed the plaintive ancestress of the earth pursuing as in the days when no living creature yet existed its lunatic immemorial agitation now these roads were no longer simply the means of rejoining albertine when i recognised each of them in their uniformity knowing how far they would run in a straight line where they would turn i remembered that i had followed them while i thought of mlle de stermaria and also that this same eagerness to find albertine i had felt in paris as i walked the streets along which mme de guermantes might pass they assumed for me the profound monotony the moral significance of a sort of ruled line that my character must follow it was natural and yet it was not without importance they reminded me that it was my fate to pursue only phantoms creatures whose reality existed to a great extent in my imagination there are people indeed — and this had been my case from my childhood — for whom all the things that have a fixed value assessable by others fortune success high positions do not count what they must have is phantoms they sacrifice all the rest leave no stone unturned make everything else subservient to the capture of some phantom but this soon fades away then they run after another prepared to return later on to the first it was not the first time that i had gone in quest of albertine the girl i had seen that first year outlined against the sea other women it is true had been interposed between the albertine whom i had first loved and her from whom i was scarcely separated at this moment other women notably the duchesse de guermantes but the reader will say why give yourself so much anxiety with regard to gilberte take so much trouble over madame de guermantes if when you have become the friend of the latter it is with the sole result of thinking no more of her but only of albertine swann before his own death might have answered the question he who had been a lover of phantoms of phantoms pursued forgotten sought afresh sometimes for a single meeting and in order to establish contact with an unreal life which at once escaped these balbec roads were full when i thought that their trees pear trees apple trees tamarisks would outlive me i seemed to receive from them the warning to set myself to work at last before the hour should strike of rest everlasting

   i left the carriage at quetteholme ran down the sunken path crossed the brook by a plank and found albertine painting in front of the church all spires and crockets thorny and red blossoming like a rose bush the lantern alone shewed an unbroken front and the smiling surface of the stone was abloom with angels who continued before the twentieth century couple that we were to celebrate taper in hand the ceremonies of the thirteenth it was they that albertine was endeavouring to portray on her prepared canvas and imitating elstir she was laying on the paint in sweeping strokes trying to obey the noble rhythm set the great master had told her by those angels so different from any that he knew then she collected her things leaning upon one another we walked back up the sunken path leaving the little church as quiet as though it had never seen us to listen to the perpetual sound of the brook presently the car started taking us home by a different way we passed marcouville l’orgueilleuse over its church half new half restored the setting sun spread its patina as fine as that of centuries through it the great hasreliefs seemed to be visible only through a floating layer half liquid half luminous the blessed virgin saint elizabeth saint joachim swam in the impalpable tide almost on dry land on the water’s or the sunlight’s surface rising in a warm dust the many modern statues reached on their pillars halfway up the golden webs of sunset in front of the church a tall cypress seemed to be in a sort of consecrated enclosure we left the car for a moment to look at it and strolled for a little no less than of her limbs albertine was directly conscious of her toque of leghorn straw and of the silken veil which were for her the source of no less satisfaction and derived from them as we strolled round the church a different sort of impetus revealed by a contentment which was inert but in which i found a certain charm veil and toque which were but a recent adventitious part of my friend but a part that was already dear to me as i followed its trail with my eyes past the cypress in the evening air she herself could not see it but guessed that the effect was pleasing for she smiled at me harmonising the poise of her head with the headgear that completed it “i don’t like it it’s restored” she said to me pointing to the church and remembering what elstir had said to her about the priceless inimitable beauty of old stone albertine could tell a restoration at a glance one could not help feeling surprised at the sureness of the taste she had already acquired in architecture as contrasted with the deplorable taste she still retained in music i cared no more than elstir for this church it was with no pleasure to myself that its sunlit front had come and posed before my eyes and i had got out of the car to examine it only out of politeness to albertine i found however that the great impressionist had contradicted himself why exalt this fetish of its objective architectural value and not take into account the transfiguration of the church by the sunset “no certainly not” said albertine “i don’t like it i like its name orgueilleuse but what i must remember to ask brichot is why saintmars is called le vêtu we shall be going there next shan’t we” she said gazing at me out of her black eyes over which her toque was pulled down like her little polo cap long ago her veil floated behind her i got back into the car with her happy in the thought that we should be going next day to saintmars where in this blazing weather when one could think only of the delights of a bath the two ancient steeples salmonpink with their lozengeshaped tiles gaping slightly as though for air looked like a pair of old sharpsnouted fish coated in scales mossgrown and red which without seeming to move were rising in a blue transparent water on leaving marcouville to shorten the road we turned aside at a crossroads where there is a farm sometimes albertine made the car stop there and asked me to go alone to fetch so that she might drink it in the car a bottle of calvados or cider which the people assured me was not effervescent and which proceeded to drench us from head to foot we sat pressed close together the people of the farm could scarcely see albertine in the closed car i handed them back their bottles we moved on again as though to continue that private life by ourselves that lovers’ existence which they might suppose us to lead and of which this halt for refreshment had been only an insignificant moment a supposition that would have appeared even less farfetched if they had seen us after albertine had drunk her bottle of cider she seemed then positively unable to endure the existence of an interval between herself and me which as a rule did not trouble her beneath her linen skirt her legs were pressed against mine she brought close against my cheeks her own cheeks which had turned pale warm and red over the cheekbones with something ardent and faded about them such as one sees in girls from the slums at such moments almost as quickly as her personality her voice changed also she forsook her own voice to adopt another raucous bold almost dissolute night began to fall what a pleasure to feel her leaning against me with her toque and her veil reminding me that it is always thus seated side by side that we meet couples who are in love i was perhaps in love with albertine but as i did not venture to let her see my love although it existed in me it could only be like an abstract truth of no value until one has succeeded in checking it by experiment as it was it seemed to me unrealisable and outside the plane of life as for my jealousy it urged me to leave albertine as little as possible although i knew that it would not be completely cured until i had parted from her for ever i could even feel it in her presence but would then take care that the circumstances should not be repeated which had aroused it once for example on a fine morning we went to luncheon at rivebelle the great glazed doors of the diningroom and of that hall in the form of a corridor in which tea was served stood open revealing the sunlit lawns beyond of which the huge restaurant seemed to form a part the waiter with the flushed face and black hair that writhed like flames was flying from end to end of that vast expanse less rapidly than in the past for he was no longer an assistant but was now in charge of a row of tables nevertheless owing to his natural activity sometimes far off in the diningroom at other times nearer but out of doors serving visitors who had preferred to feed in the garden one caught sight of him now here now there like successive statues of a young god running some in the interior which for that matter was well lighted of a mansion bounded by a vista of green grass others beneath the trees in the bright radiance of an open air life for a moment he was close to ourselves albertine replied absent mindedly to what i had just said to her she was gazing at him with rounded eyes for a minute or two i felt that one may be close to the person whom one loves and yet not have her with one they had the appearance of being engaged in a mysterious conversation rendered mute by my presence and the sequel possibly of meetings in the past of which i knew nothing or merely of a glance that he had given her — at which i was the terzo incomodo from whom the others try to hide things even when forcibly recalled by his employer he had withdrawn from us albertine while continuing her meal seemed to be regarding the restaurant and its gardens merely as a lighted runningtrack on which there appeared here and there amid the varied scenery the swiftfoot god with the black tresses at one moment i asked myself whether she was not going to rise up and follow him leaving me alone at my table but in the days that followed i began to forget for ever this painful impression for i had decided never to return to rivebelle i had extracted a promise from albertine who assured me that she had never been there before and would never return there and i denied that the nimblefooted waiter had had eyes only for her so that she should not believe that my company had deprived her of a pleasure it happened now and again that i would revisit rivebelle but alone and drink too much as i had done there in the past as i drained a final glass i gazed at a round pattern painted on the white wall concentrated upon it the pleasure that i felt it alone in the world had any existence for me i pursued it touched it and lost it by turns with my wavering glance and felt indifferent to the future contenting myself with my painted pattern like a butterfly circling about a poised butterfly with which it is going to end its life in an act of supreme consummation the moment was perhaps particularly well chosen for giving up a woman whom no very recent or very keen suffering obliged me to ask for this balm for a malady which they possess who have caused it i was calmed by these very drives which even if i did not think of them at the moment save as a foretaste of a morrow which itself notwithstanding the longing with which it filled me was not to be different from today had the charm of having been torn from the places which albertine had frequented hitherto and where i had not been with her her aunt’s house those of her girl friends the charm not of a positive joy but only of the calming of an anxiety and quite strong nevertheless for at an interval of a few days when my thoughts turned to the farm outside which we had sat drinking cider or simply to the stroll we had taken round saintmars le vêtu remembering that albertine had been walking by my side in her toque the sense of her presence added of a sudden so strong a virtue to the trivial image of the modern church that at the moment when the sunlit front came thus of its own accord to pose before me in memory it was like a great soothing compress laid upon my heart i dropped albertine at parville but only to join her again in the evening and lie stretched out by her side in the darkness upon the beach no doubt i did not see her every day still i could say to myself “if she were to give an account of how she spent her time of her life it would still be myself that played the largest part in it” and we spent together long hours on end which brought into my days so sweet an intoxication that even when at parville she jumped from the car which i was to send to fetch her an hour later i no more felt myself to be alone in it than if before leaving me she had strewn it with flowers i might have dispensed with seeing her every day i was going to be happy when i left her and i knew that the calming effect of that happiness might be prolonged over many days but at that moment i heard albertine as she left me say to her aunt or to a girl friend “then tomorrow at eightthirty we mustn’t be late the others will be ready at a quarter past” the conversation of a woman one loves is like the soil that covers a subterranean and dangerous water one feels at every moment beneath the words the presence the penetrating chill of an invisible pool one perceives here and there its treacherous percolation but the water itself remains hidden the moment i heard these words of albertine my calm was destroyed i wanted to ask her to let me see her the following morning so as to prevent her from going to this mysterious rendezvous at halfpast eight which had been mentioned in my presence only in covert terms she would no doubt have begun by obeying me while regretting that she had to give up her plans in time she would have discovered my permanent need to upset them i should have become the person from whom one hides everything besides it is probable that these gatherings from which i was excluded amounted to very little and that it was perhaps from the fear that i might find one of the other girls there vulgar or boring that i was not invited to them unfortunately this life so closely involved with albertine’s had a reaction not only upon myself to me it brought calm to my mother it caused an anxiety her confession of which destroyed my calm as i entered the hotel happy in my own mind determined to terminate one day soon an existence the end of which i imagined to depend upon my own volition my mother said to me hearing me send a message to the chauffeur to go and fetch albertine “how you do waste your money” françoise in her simple and expressive language said with greater force “that’s the way the money goes” “try” mamma went on “not to become like charles de sévigné of whom his mother said ‘his hand is a crucible in which money melts’ besides i do really think you have gone about quite enough with albertine i assure you you’re overdoing it even to her it may seem ridiculous i was delighted to think that you found her a distraction i am not asking you never to see her again but simply that it may not be impossible to meet one of you without the other” my life with albertine a life devoid of keen pleasures — that is to say of keen pleasures that i could feel — that life which i intended to change at any moment choosing a calm interval became once again suddenly and for a time necessary to me when by these words of mamma’s it found itself threatened i told my mother that what she had just said would delay for perhaps two months the decision for which she asked which otherwise i would have reached before the end of that week mamma began to laugh so as not to depress me at this instantaneous effect of her advice and promised not to speak of the matter to me again so as not to prevent the rebirth of my good intentions but since my grandmother’s death whenever mamma allowed herself to laugh the incipient laugh would be cut short and would end in an almost heartbroken expression of sorrow whether from remorse at having been able for an instant to forget or else from the recrudescence which this brief moment of oblivion had given to her cruel obsession but to the thoughts aroused in her by the memory of my grandmother which was rooted in my mother’s mind i felt that on this occasion there were added others relative to myself to what my mother dreaded as the sequel of my intimacy with albertine an intimacy to which she dared not however put a stop in view of what i had just told her but she did not appear convinced that i was not mistaken she remembered all the years in which my grandmother and she had refrained from speaking to me of my work and of a more wholesome rule of life which i said the agitation into which their exhortations threw me alone prevented me from beginning and which notwithstanding their obedient silence i had failed to pursue after dinner the car brought albertine back there was still a glimmer of daylight the air was not so warm but after a scorching day we both dreamed of strange and delicious coolness then to our fevered eyes the narrow slip of moon appeared at first as on the evening when i had gone to the princesse de guermantes’s and albertine had telephoned to me like the slight fine rind then like the cool section of a fruit which an invisible knife was beginning to peel in the sky sometimes too it was i that went in search of my mistress a little later in that case she would be waiting for me before the arcade of the market at maineville at first i could not make her out i would begin to fear that she might not be coming that she had misunderstood me then i saw her in her white blouse with blue spots spring into the car by my side with the light bound of a young animal rather than a girl and it was like a dog too that she began to caress me interminably when night had fallen and as the manager of the hotel remarked to me the sky was all ‘studied’ with stars if we did not go for a drive in the forest with a bottle of champagne then without heeding the strangers who were still strolling upon the faintly lighted front but who could not have seen anything a yard away on the dark sand we would lie down in the shelter of the dunes that same body in whose suppleness abode all the feminine marine and sportive grace of the girls whom i had seen for the first time pass before a horizon of waves i held pressed against my own beneath the same rug by the edge of the motionless sea divided by a tremulous path of light and we listened to the sea without tiring and with the same pleasure both when it held its breath suspended for so long that one thought the reflux would never come and when at last it gasped out at our feet the long awaited murmur finally i took albertine back to parville when we reached her house we were obliged to break off our kisses for fear lest some one should see us not wishing to go to bed she returned with me to balbec from where i took her back for the last time to parville the chauffeurs of those early days of the motorcar were people who went to bed at all hours and as a matter of fact i returned to balbec only with the first dews of morning alone this time but still surrounded with the presence of my mistress gorged with an inexhaustible provision of kisses on my table i would find a telegram or a postcard albertine again she had written them at quetteholme when i had gone off by myself in the car to tell me that she was thinking of me i got into bed as i read them over then i caught sight over the curtains of the bright streak of daylight and said to myself that we must be in love with one another after all since we had spent the night in one another’s arms when next morning i caught sight of albertine on the front i was so afraid of her telling me that she was not free that day and could not accede to my request that we should go out together that i delayed as long as possible making the request i was all the more uneasy since she wore a cold preoccupied air people were passing whom she knew doubtless she had made plans for the afternoon from which i was excluded i looked at her i looked at that charming body that blushing head of albertine rearing in front of me the enigma of her intentions the unknown decision which was to create the happiness or misery of my afternoon it was a whole state of the soul a whole future existence that had assumed before my eyes the allegorical and fatal form of a girl and when at last i made up my mind when with the most indifferent air that i could muster i asked “are we to go out together now and again this evening” and she replied “with the greatest pleasure” then the sudden replacement in the rosy face of my long uneasiness by adelicious sense of ease made even more precious to me those outlines to which i was perpetually indebted for the comfort the relief that we feel after a storm has broken i repeated to myself “how sweet she is what an adorable creature” in an excitement less fertile than that caused by intoxication scarcely more profound than that of friendship but far superior to the excitement of social life we cancelled our order for the car only on the days when there was a dinnerparty at the verdurins’ and on those when albertine not being free to go out with me i took the opportunity to inform anybody who wished to see me that i should be remaining at balbec i gave saintloup permission to come on these days but on these days only for on one occasion when he had arrived unexpectedly i had preferred to forego the pleasure of seeing albertine rather than run the risk of his meeting her than endanger the state of happy calm in which i had been dwelling for some time and see my jealousy revive and i had been at my ease only after saintloup had gone and so he pledged himself with regret but with scrupulous observance never to come to balbec unless summoned there by myself in the past when i thought with longing of the hours that mme de guermantes passed in his company how i valued the privilege of seeing him other people never cease to change places in relation to ourselves in the imperceptible but eternal march of the world we regard them as motionless in a moment of vision too short for us to perceive the motion that is sweeping them on but we have only to select in our memory two pictures taken of them at different moments close enough together however for them not to have altered in themselves — perceptibly that is to say — and the difference between the two pictures is a measure of the displacement that they have undergone in relation to us he alarmed me dreadfully by talking to me of the verdurins i was afraid that he might ask me to take him there which would have been quite enough what with the jealousy that i should be feeling all the time to spoil all the pleasure that i found in going there with albertine but fortunately robert assured me that on the contrary the one thing he desired above all others was not to know them “no” he said to me “i find that sort of clerical atmosphere maddening” i did not at first understand the application of the adjective clerical to the verdurins but the end of saintloup’s speech threw a light on his meaning his concessions to those fashions in words which one is often astonished to see adopted by intelligent men “i mean the houses” he said “where people form a tribe a religious order a chapel you aren’t going to tell me that they’re not a little sect they’re all butter and honey to the people who belong no words bad enough for those who don’t the question is not as for hamlet to be or not to be but to belong or not to belong you belong my uncle charlus belongs i can’t help it i never have gone in for that sort of thing it isn’t my fault”

   i need hardly say that the rule which i had imposed upon saintloup never to come and see me unless i had expressly invited him i promulgated no less strictly for all and sundry of the persons with whom i had gradually begun to associate at la raspelière féterne montsurvent and elsewhere and when i saw from the hotel the smoke of the three o’clock train which in the anfractuosity of the cliffs of parville left its stable plume which long remained hanging from the flank of the green slopes i had no hesitation as to the identity of the visitor who was coming to tea with me and was still like a classical deity concealed from me by that little cloud i am obliged to confess that this visitor authorised by me beforehand to come was hardly ever saniette and i have often reproached myself for this omission but saniette’s own consciousness of his being a bore far more so naturally when he came to pay a call than when he told a story had the effect that albeit he was more learned more intelligent and a better man all round than most people it seemed impossible to feel in his company i do not say any pleasure but anything save an almost intolerable irritation which spoiled one’s whole afternoon probably if saniette had frankly admitted this boredom which he was afraid of causing one would not have dreaded his visits boredom is one of the least of the evils that we have to endure his boringness existed perhaps only in the imagination of other people or had been inoculated into him by them by some process of suggestion which had taken root in his charming modesty but he was so anxious not to let it be seen that he was not sought after that he dared not offer himself certainly he was right in not behaving like the people who are so glad to be able to raise their hats in a public place that when not having seen you for years they catch sight of you in a box with smart people whom they do not know they give you a furtive but resounding goodevening seeking an excuse in the pleasure the emotion that they felt on seeing you on learning that you are going about again that you are looking well etc saniette on the contrary was lacking in courage he might at mme verdurin’s or in the little tram have told me that it would give him great pleasure to come and see me at balbec were he not afraid of disturbing me such a suggestion would not have alarmed me on the contrary he offered nothing but with a tortured expression on his face and a stare as indestructible as a fired enamel into the composition of which however there entered with a passionate desire to see one — provided he did not find some one else who was more entertaining — the determination not to let this desire be manifest said to me with a detached air “you don’t happen to know what you will be doing in the next few days because i shall probably be somewhere in the neighbourhood of balbec not that it makes the slightest difference i just thought i would ask you” this air deceived nobody and the inverse signs whereby we express our sentiments by their opposites are so clearly legible that we ask ourselves how thete can still be people who say for instance “i have so many invitations that i don’t know where to lay my head” to conceal the fact that they have been invited nowhere but what was more this detached air probably on account of the heterogeneous elements that had gone to form it gave you what you would never have felt in the fear of boredom or in a frank admission of the desire to see you that is to say that sort of distaste of repulsion which in the category of relations of simple social courtesy corresponds to — in that of love — the disguised offer made to a lady by the lover whom she does not love to see her on the following day he protesting the while that it does not really matter or indeed not that offer but an attitude of false coldness there emanated at once from saniette’s person something or other which made you answer him in the tenderest of tones “no unfortunately this week i must explain to you    ” and i allowed to call upon me instead people who were a long way his inferiors but had not his gaze charged with melancholy or his mouth wrinkled with all the bitterness of all the calls which he longed while saying nothing about them to pay upon this person and that unfortunately it was very rarely that saniette did not meet in the ‘crawler’ the guest who was coming to see me if indeed the latter had not said to me at the verdurins’ “don’t forget i’m coming to see you on thursday” the very day on which i had just told saniette that i should not be at home so that he came in the end to imagine life as filled with entertainments arranged behind his back if not actually at his expense on the other hand as none of us is ever a single person this too discreet of men was morbidly indiscreet on the one occasion on which he happened to come and see me uninvited a letter i forget from whom had been left lying on my table after the first few minutes i saw that he was paying only the vaguest attention to what i was saying the letter of whose subject he knew absolutely nothing fascinated him and at every moment i expected his glittering eyeballs to detach themselves from their sockets and fly to the letter which of no importance in itself his curiosity had made magnetic you would have called him a bird about to dash into the jaws of a serpent finally he could restrain himself no longer he began by altering its position as though he were trying to tidy my room this not sufficing him he took it up turned it over turned it back again as though mechanically another form of his indiscretion was that once he had fastened himself to you he could not tear himself away as i was feeling unwell that day i asked him to go back by the next train in halfanhour’s time he did not doubt that i was feeling unwell but replied “i shall stay for an hour and a quarter and then i shall go” since then i have regretted that i did not tell him whenever i had an opportunity to come and see me who knows possibly i might have charmed away his ill fortune other people would have invited him for whom he would immediately have deserted myself so that my invitations would have had the twofold advantage of giving him pleasure and ridding me of his company

   on the days following those on which i had been ‘at home’ i naturally did not expect any visitors and the motorcar would come to fetch us albertine and myself and when we returned aimé on the lowest step of the hotel could not help looking with passionate curious greedy eyes to see what tip i was giving the chauffeur it was no use my enclosing my coin or note in my clenched fist aimé‘s gaze tore my fingers apart he turned his head away a moment later for he was discreet well bred and indeed was himself content with relatively small wages but the money that another person received aroused in him an irrepressible curiosity and made his mouth water during these brief moments he wore the attentive feverish air of a boy reading one of jules verne’s tales or of a diner seated at a neighbouring table in a restaurant who seeing the waiter carving for you a pheasant which he himself either could not afford or would not order abandons for an instant his serious thoughts to fasten upon the bird a gaze which love and longing cause to smile

   and so day after day these excursions in the motorcar followed one another but once as i was being taken up to my room the liftboy said to me “that gentleman has been he gave me a message for you” the liftboy uttered these words in an almost inaudible voice coughing and expectorating in my face “i haven’t half caught cold” he went on as though i were incapable of perceiving this for myself “the doctor says it’s whoopingcough” and he began once more to cough and expectorate over me “don’t tire yourself by trying to speak” i said to him with an air of kindly interest which was feigned i was afraid of catching the whoopingcough which with my tendency to choking fits would have been a serious matter to me but he made a point of honour like a virtuoso who refuses to let himself be taken to hospital of talking and expectorating all the time “no it doesn’t matter” he said “perhaps not to you” i thought “but to me it does” “besides i shall be returning soon to paris” “excellent provided he doesn’t give it to me first” “it seems” he went on “that paris is quite superb it must be even more superb than here or montecarlo although pages in fact visitors and even head waiters who have been to montecarlo for the season have often told me that paris was not so superb as montecarlo they were cheated perhaps and yet to be a head waiter you’ve got to have your wits about you to take all the orders reserve tables you need a head i’ve heard it said that it’s even more terrible than writing plays and books” we had almost reached my landing when the liftboy carried me down again to the ground floor because he found that the button was not working properly and in a moment had put it right i told him that i preferred to walk upstairs by which i meant without putting it in so many words that i preferred not to catch whoopingcough but with a cordial and contagious burst of coughing the boy thrust me back into the lift “there’s no danger now i’ve fixed the button” seeing that he was not ceasing to talk preferring to learn the name of my visitor and the message that he had left rather than the comparative beauties of balbec paris and montecarlo i said to him as one might say to a tenor who is wearying one with benjamin godard “won’t you sing me some debussy” “but who is the person that called to see me” “it’s the gentleman you went out with yesterday i am going to fetch his card it’s with my porter” as the day before i had dropped robert de saintloup at doncières station before going to meet albertine i supposed that the liftboy was referring to him but it was the chauffeur and by describing him in the words “the gentleman you went out with” he taught me at the same time that a working man is just as much a gentleman as a man about town a lesson in the use of words only for in point of fact i had never made any distinction between the classes and if i had felt on hearing a chauffeur called a gentleman the same astonishment as comte x who had only held that rank for a week and whom by saying “the comtesse looks tired” i made turn his head round to see who it was that i meant it was simply because i was not familiar with that use of the word i had never made any difference between working men professional men and noblemen and i should have been equally ready to make any of them my friends with a certain preference for the working men and after them for the noblemen not because i liked them better but because i knew that one could expect greater courtesy from them towards the working men than one finds among professional men whether because the great nobleman does not despise the working man as the professional man does or else because they are naturally polite to anybody as beautiful women are glad to bestow a smile which they know to be so joyfully received i cannot however pretend that this habit that i had of putting people of humble station on a level with people in society even if it was quite understood by the latter was always entirely satisfactory to my mother not that humanly speaking she made any difference between one person and another and if françoise was ever in sorrow or in pain she was comforted and tended by mamma with the same devotion as her best friend but my mother was too much my grandmother’s daughter not to accept in social matters the rule of caste people at combray might have kind hearts sensitive natures might have adopted the most perfect theories of human equality my mother when a footman became emancipated began to say ‘you’ and slipped out of the habit of addressing me in the third person was moved by these presumptions to the same wrath that breaks out in saintsimon’s memoirs whenever a nobleman who is not entitled to it seizes a pretext for assuming the style of ‘highness’ in an official document or for not paying dukes the deference he owes to them and is gradually beginning to lay aside there was a ‘combray spirit’ so refractory that it will require centuries of good nature my mother’s was boundless of theories of equality to succeed in dissolving it i cannot swear that in my mother certain particles of this spirit had not remained insoluble she would have been as reluctant to give her hand to a footman as she would have been ready to give him ten francs which for that matter he was far more glad to receive to her whether she admitted it or not masters were masters and servants were the people who fed in the kitchen when she saw the driver of a motorcar dining with me in the restaurant she was not altogether pleased and said to me “it seems to me you might have a more suitable friend than a mechanic” as she might have said had it been a question of my marriage “you might find somebody better than that” this particular chauffeur fortunately i never dreamed of inviting him to dinner had come to tell me that the motorcar company which had sent him to balbec for the season had ordered him to return to paris on the following day this excuse especially as the chauffeur was charming and expressed himself so simply that one would always have taken anything he said for gospel seemed to us to be most probably true it was only half so there was as a matter of fact no more work for him at balbec and in any case the company being only half convinced of the veracity of the young evangelist bowed over the consecration cross of his steeringwheel was anxious that he should return as soon as possible to paris and indeed if the young apostle wrought a miracle in multiplying his mileage when he was calculating it for m de charlus when on the other hand it was a matter of rendering his account to the company he divided what he had earned by six in consequence of which the company coming to the conclusion either that nobody wanted a car now at balbec which so late in the season was quite probable or that it was being robbed decided that upon either hypothesis the best thing was to recall him to paris not that there was very much work for him there what the chauffeur wished was to avoid if possible the dead season i have said — though i was unaware of this at the time when the knowledge of it would have saved me much annoyance — that he was on intimate terms without their ever shewing any sign of acquaintance before other people with morel starting from the day on which he was ordered back before he realised that there was still a way out of going we were obliged to content ourselves for our excursions with hiring a carriage or sometimes as an amusement for albertine and because she was fond of riding a pair of saddlehorses the carriages were unsatisfactory “what a rattletrap” albertine would say i would often as it happened have preferred to be driving by myself without being ready to fix a date i longed to put an end to this existence which i blamed for making me renounce not so much work as pleasure it would happen also however that the habits which bound me were suddenly abolished generally when some former self full of the desire to live a merry life took the place of what was my self at the moment i felt this longing to escape especially strong one day when having left albertine at her aunt’s i had gone on horseback to call on the verdurins and had taken an unfrequented path through the woods the beauty of which they had extolled to me clinging to the outline of the cliffs it alternately climbed and then hemmed in by dense woods on either side dived into savage gorges for a moment the barren rocks by which i was surrounded the sea visible in their jagged intervals swam before my eyes like fragments of another universe i had recognised the mountainous and marine landscape which elstir had made the scene of those two admirable water colours ‘poet meeting a muse’ ‘young man meeting a centaur’ which i had seen at the duchesse de guermantes’s the thought of them transported the place in which i was so far beyond the world of today that i should not have been surprised if like the young man of the prehistoric age that elstir painted i had in the course of my ride come upon a mythological personage suddenly my horse gave a start he had heard a strange sound it was all i could do to hold him and remain in the saddle then i raised in the direction from which the sound seemed to come my eyes filled with tears and saw not two hundred feet above my head against the sun between two great wings of flashing metal which were carrying him on a creature whose barely visible face appeared to me to resemble that of a man i was as deeply moved as a greek upon seeing for the first time a demigod i cried also for i was ready to cry the moment i realised that the sound came from above my head — aeroplanes were still rare in those days — at the thought that what i was going to see for the first time was an aeroplane then just as when in a newspaper one feels that one is coming to a moving passage the mere sight of the machine was enough to make me burst into tears meanwhile the airman seemed to be uncertain of his course i felt that there lay open before him — before me had not habit made me a prisoner — all the routes in space in life itself he flew on let himself glide for a few moments over the sea then quickly making up his mind seeming to yield to some attraction the reverse of gravity as though returning to his native element with a slight movement of his golden wings rose sheer into the sky

   to come back to the mechanic he demanded of morel that the verdurins should not merely replace their break by a motorcar which granted their generosity towards the faithful was comparatively easy but what was less easy replace their head coachman the sensitive young man who was inclined to dark thoughts by himself the chauffeur this change was carried out in a few days by the following device morel had begun by seeing that the coachman was robbed of everything that he needed for the carriage one day it was the bit that was missing another day the curb at other times it was the cushion of his boxseat that had vanished or his whip his rug his hammer sponge chamoisleather but he always managed to borrow what he required from a neighbour only he was late in bringing round the carriage which put him in m verdurin’s bad books and plunged him in a state of melancholy and dark thoughts the chauffeur who was in a hurry to take his place told morel that he would have to return to paris it was time to do something desperate morel persuaded m verdurin’s servants that the young coachman had declared that he would set a trap for the lot of them boasting that he could take on all six of them at once and assured them that they could not overlook such an insult he himself could not take any part in the quarrel but he warned them so that they might be on their guard it was arranged that while m and mme verdurin and their guests were out walking the servants should fall upon the young man in the coach house i may mention although it was only the pretext for what was bound to happen but because the people concerned interested me later on that the verdurins had a friend staying with them that day whom they had promised to take for a walk before his departure which was fixed for that same evening

   what surprised me greatly when we started off for our walk was that morel who was coming with us and was to play his violin under the trees said to me “listen i have a sore arm i don’t want to say anything about it to mme verdurin but you might ask her to send for one of her footmen howsler for instance he can carry my things” “i think you ought to suggest some one else” i replied “he will be wanted here for dinner” a look of anger passed over morel’s face “no i’m not going to trust my violin to any tom dick or harry” i realised later on his reason for this selection howsler was the beloved brother of the young coachman and if he had been left at home might have gone to his rescue during our walk dropping his voice so that the elder howsler should not overhear “what a good fellow he is” said morel “so is his brother for that matter if he hadn’t that fatal habit of drinking    ” “did you say drinking” said mme verdurin turning pale at the idea of having a coachman who drank “you’ve never noticed it i always say to myself it’s a miracle that he’s never had an accident while he’s been driving you” “does he drive anyone else then” “you can easily see how many spills he’s had his face today is a mass of bruises i don’t know how he’s escaped being killed he’s broken his shafts” “i haven’t seen him today” said mme’ verdurin trembling at the thought of what might have happened to her “you appal me” she tried to cut short the walk so as to return at once but morel chose an aria by bach with endless variations to keep her away from the house as soon as we got back she went to the stable saw the new shaft and howsler streaming with blood she was on the point of telling him without making any comment on what she had seen that she did not require a coachman any longer and of paying him his wages but of his own accord not wishing to accuse his fellowservants to whose animosity he attributed retrospectively the theft of all his saddlery and seeing that further patience would only end in his being left for dead on the ground he asked leave to go at once which made everything quite simple the chauffeur began his duties next day and later on mme verdurin who had been obliged to engage another was so well satisfied with him that she recommended him to me warmly as a man on whom i might rely i knowing nothing of all this used to engage him by the day in paris but i am anticipating events i shall come to all this when i reach the story of albertine at the present moment we are at la raspelière where i have just been dining for the first time with my mistress and m de charlus with morel the reputed son of an ‘agent’ who drew a fixed salary of thirty thousand francs annually kept his carriage and had any number of majordomos subordinates gardeners bailiffs and farmers at his beck and call but since i have so far anticipated i do not wish to leave the reader under the impression that morel was entirely wicked he was rather a mass of contradictions capable on certain days of being genuinely kind
   i was naturally greatly surprised to hear that the coachman had been dismissed and even more surprised when i recognised his successor as the chauffeur who had been taking albertine and myself in his car but he poured out a complicated story according to which he had thought that he was summoned back to paris where an order had come for him to go to the verdurins and i did not doubt his word for an instant the coachman’s dismissal was the cause of morel’s talking to me for a few minutes to express his regret at the departure of that worthy fellow however even apart from the moments when i was alone and he literally bounded towards me beaming with joy morel seeing that everybody made much of me at la raspelière and feeling that he was deliberately cutting himself off from the society of a person who could in no way imperil him since he had made me burn my boats and had destroyed all possibility of my treating him with an air of patronage which i had never for that matter dreamed of adopting ceased to hold aloof from me i attributed his change of attitude to the influence of m de charlus which as a matter of fact did make him in certain respects less limited more of an artist but in others when he interpreted literally the eloquent insincere and moreover transient formulas of his master made him stupider than ever that m de charlus might have said something to him was as a matter of fact the only thing that occurred to me how was i to have guessed then what i was told afterwards and have never been certain of its truth andrée’s assertions as to everything that concerned albertine especially later on having always seemed to me to be statements to be received with caution for as we have already seen she was not genuinely fond of my mistress and was jealous of her a thing which in any event even if it was true was remarkably well concealed from me by both of them that albertine was on the best of terms with morel the novel attitude which about the time of the coachman’s dismissal morel adopted with regard to myself enabled me to change my opinion of him i retained the ugly impression of his character which had been suggested by the servility which this young man had shewn me when he needed my services followed as soon as the service had been rendered by a scornful aloofness as though he did not even see me i still lacked evidence of his venal relations with m de charlus and also of his bestial and purposeless instincts the nongratification of which when it occurred or the complications that they involved were the cause of his sorrows but his character was not so uniformly vile and was full of contradictions he resembled an old book of the middle ages full of mistakes of absurd traditions of obscenities he was extraordinarily composite i had supposed at first that his art in which he was really a pastmaster had given him superiorities that went beyond the virtuosity of the mere performer once when i spoke of my wish to start work “work become famous” he said to me “who said that” i inquired “fontanes to chateaubriand” he also knew certain love letters of napoleon good i thought to myself he reads but this phrase which he had read i know not where was doubtless the only one that he knew in the whole of ancient or modern literature for he repeated it to me every evening another which he quoted even more frequently to prevent me from breathing a word about him to anybody was the following which he considered equally literary whereas it is barely grammatical or at any rate makes no kind of sense except perhaps to a mysteryloving servant “beware of the wary” as a matter of fact if one cast back from this stupid maxim to what fontanes had said to chateaubriand one explored a whole side varied but less contradictory than one might suppose of morel’s character this youth who provided there was money to be made by it would have done anything in the world and without remorse — perhaps not without an odd sort of vexation amounting to nervous excitement to which however the name remorse could not for a moment be applied — who would had it been to his advantage have plunged in distress not to say mourning whole families this youth who set money above everything above not to speak of unselfish kindness the most natural sentiments of common humanity this same youth nevertheless set above money his certificate as firstprize winner at the conservatoire and the risk of there being anything said to his discredit in the flute or counterpoint class and so his most violent rages his most sombre and unjustifiable fits of illtemper arose from what he himself generalising doubtless from certain particular cases in which he had met with spiteful people called universal treachery he flattered himself that he escaped from this fault by never speaking about anyone by concealing his tactics by distrusting everybody alas for me in view of what was to happen after my return to paris his distrust had not ‘held’ in the case of the balbec chauffeur in whom he had doubtless recognised a peer that is to say in contradiction of his maxim a wary person in the good sense of the word a wary person who remains obstinately silent before honest folk and at once comes to an understanding with a blackguard it seemed to him — and he was not absolutely wrong — that his distrust would enable him always to save his bacon to slip unscathed out of the most perilous adventures without anyone’s being able not indeed to prove but even to suggest anything against him in the institution in the rue bergère he would work become famous would perhaps be one day with his respectability still intact examiner in the violin on the board of that great and glorious conservatoire

   but it is perhaps crediting morel’s brain with too much logic to attempt to discriminate between these contradictions as a matter of fact his nature was just like a sheet of paper that has been folded so often in every direction that it is impossible to straighten it out he seemed to act upon quite lofty principles and in a magnificent hand marred by the most elementary mistakes in spelling spent hours writing to his brother that he had behaved badly to his sisters that he was their elder their natural support etc and to his sisters that they had shewn a want of respect for himself

   presently as summer came to an end when one got out of the train at douville the sun dimmed by the prevailing mist had ceased to be anything more in a sky that was uniformly mauve than a lump of redness to the great peace which descends at nightfall over these tufted saltmarshes and had tempted a number of parisians painters mostly to spend their holidays at douville was added a moisture which made them seek shelter early in their little bungalows in several of these the lamp was already lighted only a few cows remained out of doors gazing at the sea and lowing while others more interested in humanity turned their attention towards our carriages a single painter who had set up his easel where the ground rose slightly was striving to render that great calm that hushed luminosity perhaps the cattle were going to serve him unconsciously and kindly as models for their contemplative air and their solitary presence when the human beings had withdrawn contributed in their own way to enhance the strong impression of repose that evening conveys and a few weeks later the transposition was no less agreeable when as autumn advanced the days became really short and we were obliged to make our journey m the dark if i had been out anywhere in the afternoon i had to go back to change my clothes at the latest by five o’clock when at this season the round red sun had already sunk half way down the slanting sheet of glass which formerly i had detested and like a greek fire was inflaming the sea in the glass fronts of all my bookcases some wizard’s gesture having revived as i put on my dinnerjacket the alert and frivolous self that was mine when i used to go with saintloup to dine at rivebelle and on the evening when i looked forward to taking mme de stermaria to dine on the island in the bois i began unconsciously to hum the same tune that i had hummed then and it was only when i realised this that by the song i recognised the resurrected singer who indeed knew no other tune the first time that i sang it i was beginning to be in love with albertine but i imagined that i would never get to know her later on in paris it was when i had ceased to be in love with her and some days after i had enjoyed her for the first time now it was when i was in love with her again and on the point of going out to dinner with her to the great regret of the manager who supposed that i would end by staying at la raspelière altogether and deserting his hotel and assured me that he had heard that fever was prevalent in that neighbourhood due to the marshes of the bac and their ‘stagnous’ water i was delighted by the multiplicity in which i saw my life thus spread over three planes and besides when one becomes for an instant one’s former self that is to say different from what one has been for some time past one’s sensibility being no longer dulled by habit receives the slightest shocks of those vivid impressions which make everything that has preceded them fade into insignificance and to which because of their intensity we attach ourselves with the momentary enthusiasm of a drunken man it was already night when we got into the omnibus or carriage which was to take us to the station where we would find the little train and in the hall the chief magistrate was saying to us “ah you are going to la raspelière sapristi she has a nerve your mme verdurin to make you travel an hour by train in the dark simply to dine with her and then to start off again at ten o’clock at night with a wind blowing like the very devil it is easy to see that you have nothing else to do” he added rubbing his hands together no doubt he spoke thus from annoyance at not having been invited and also from the satisfaction that people feel who are ‘busy’— though it be with the most idiotic occupation — at ‘not having time’ to do what you are doing

   certainly it is only right that the man who draws up reports adds up figures answers business letters follows the movements of the stock exchange should feel when he says to you with a sneer “it’s all very well for you you have nothing better to do” an agreeable sense of his own superiority but this would be no less contemptuous would be even more so for dining out is a thing that the busy man does also were your recreation writing hamlet or merely reading it wherein busy men shew a want of reflexion for the disinterested culture which seems to them a comic pastime of idle people at the moment when they find them engaged in it is they ought to remember the same that in their own profession brings to the fore men who may not be better magistrates or administrators than themselves but before whose rapid advancement they bow their heads saying “it appears he’s a great reader a most distinguished individual” but above all the chief magistrate did not take into account that what pleased me about these dinners at la raspelière was that as he himself said quite rightly though as a criticism they ‘meant a regular journey’ a journey whose charm appeared to me all the more thrilling in that it was not an object in itself and no one made any attempt to find pleasure in it — that being reserved for the party for which we were bound and greatly modified by all the atmosphere that surrounded it it was already night now when i exchanged the warmth of the hotel — the hotel that had become my home — for the railway carriage into which i climbed with albertine in which a glimmer of lamplight on the window shewed at certain halts of the panting little train that we had arrived at a station so that there should be no risk of cottard’s missing us and not having heard the name of the station i opened the door but what burst headlong into the carriage was not any of the faithful but the wind the rain the cold in the darkness i could make out fields i could hear the sea we were in the open country albertine before we were engulfed in the little nucleus examined herself in a little mirror extracted from a gold bag which she carried about with her the fact was that on our first visit mme verdurin having taken her upstairs to her dressingroom so that she might make herself tidy before dinner i had felt amid the profound calm in which i had been living for some time a slight stir of uneasiness and jealousy at being obliged to part from albertine at the foot of the stair and had become so anxious while i was by myself in the drawingroom among the little clan and asking myself what my mistress could be doing that i had sent a telegram the next day after finding out from m de charlus what the correct thing was at the moment to order from cartier’s a bag which was the joy of albertine’s life and also of mine it was for me a guarantee of peace of mind and also of my mistress’s solicitude for she had evidently seen that i did not like her to be parted from me at mme verdurin’s and arranged to make in the train all the toilet that was necessary before dinner

   included in the number of mme verdurin’s regular frequenters and reckoned the most faithful of them all had been for some months now m de charlus regularly thrice weekly the passengers who were sitting in the waitingrooms or standing upon the platform at doncièresouest used to see that stout gentleman go past with his grey hair his black moustaches his lips reddened with a salve less noticeable at the end of the season than in summer when the daylight made it more crude and the heat used to melt it as he made his way towards the little train he could not refrain simply from force of habit as a connoisseur since he now had a sentiment which kept him chaste or at least for most of the time faithful from casting at the labourers soldiers young men in tennis flannels a furtive glance at once inquisitorial and timorous after which he immediately let his eyelids droop over his halfshut eyes with the unction of an ecclesiastic engaged in telling his beads with the modesty of a bride vowed to the one love of her life or of a wellbroughtup girl the faithful were all the more convinced that he had not seen them since he got into a different compartment from theirs as often enough did princess sherbatoff also like a man who does not know whether people will be pleased or not to be seen with him and leaves them the option of coming and joining him if they choose this option had not been taken at first by the doctor who had asked us to leave him by himself in his compartment making a virtue of his natural hesitation now that he occupied a great position in the medical world it was with a smile throwing back his head looking at ski over his glasses that he said either from malice or in the hope of eliciting the opinion of the ‘comrades’ “you can understand that if i was by myself a bachelor but for my wife’s sake i ask myself whether i ought to allow him to travel with us after what you have told me” the doctor whispered “what’s that you’re saying” asked mme cottard “nothing it doesn’t concern you it’s not meant for ladies to hear” the doctor replied with a wink and with a majestic selfsatisfaction which held the balance between the dryly malicious air he adopted before his pupils and patients and the uneasiness that used in the past to accompany his shafts of wit at the verdurins’ and went on talking in a lowered tone mme cottard could make out only the words ‘one of the brotherhood’ and ‘tapette’ and as in the doctor’s vocabulary the former expression denoted the jewish race and the latter a wagging tongue mme cottard concluded that m de charlus must be a garrulous israelite she could not understand why people should keep aloof from the baron for that reason felt it her duty as the senior lady of the clan to insist that he should not be left alone and so we proceeded in a body to m de charlus’s compartment led by cottard who was still perplexed from the corner in which he was reading a volume of balzac m de charlus observed this hesitation and yet he had not raised his eyes but just as deafmutes detect from a movement of the air imperceptible to other people that some one is standing behind them so he had to warn him of other people’s coldness towards him a positive hyperaesthesia this had as it habitually does in every sphere developed in m de charlus imaginary sufferings like those neuropaths who feeling a slight lowering of the temperature induce from this that there must be a window open on the floor above become violently excited and start sneezing m de charlus if a person appeared preoccupied in his presence concluded that somebody had repeated to that person a remark that he had made about him but there was no need even for the other person to have a distracted or a sombre or a smiling air he would invent them on the other hand cordiality completely concealed from him the slanders of which he had not heard

   having begun by detecting cottard’s hesitation if greatly to the surprise of the faithful who did not suppose that their presence had yet been observed by the reader’s lowered gaze he held out his hand to them when they were at a convenient distance he contented himself with a forward inclination of his whole person which he quickly drew back for cottard without taking in his own gloved hand the hand which the doctor had held out to him “we felt we simply must come and keep you company sir and not leave you alone like that in your little corner it is a great pleasure to us” mme cottard began in a friendly tone to the baron “i am greatly honoured” the baron intoned bowing coldly “i was so pleased to hear that you have definitely chosen this neighbourhood to set up your taber    ” she was going to say ‘tabernacle’ but it occurred to her that the word was hebraic and discourteous to a jew who might see an allusion in it and so she paused for a moment to choose another of the expressions that were familiar to her that is to say a consecrated expression “to set up i should say your penates” it is true that these deities do not appertain to the christian religion either but to one which has been dead for so long that it no longer claims any devotees whose feelings one need be afraid of hurting “we unfortunately what with term beginning and the doctor’s hospital duties can never choose our domicile for very long in one place” and glancing at a cardboard box “you see too how we poor women are less fortunate than the sterner sex to go only such a short distance as to our friends the verdurins’ we are obliged to take a whole heap of impedimenta” i meanwhile was examining the baron’s volume of balzac it was not a papercovered copy picked up on a bookstall like the volume of bergotte which he had lent me at our first meeting it was a book from his own library and as such bore the device “i belong to the baron de charlus” for which was substituted at times to shew the studious tastes of the guermantes “in proeliis non semper” or yet another motto “non sine labore” but we shall see these presently replaced by others in an attempt to please morel mme cottard a little later hit upon a subject which she felt to be of more personal interest to the baron “i don’t know whether you agree with me sir” she said to him presently “but i hold very broad views and to my mind there is a great deal of good in all religions i am not one of the people who get hydrophobia at the sight of a    protestant” “i was taught that mine is the true religion” replied m de charlus “he’s a fanatic” thought mme cottard “swann until recently was more tolerant it is true that he was a converted one” now so far from this being the case the baron was not only a christian as we know but pious with a mediaeval fervour to him as to the sculptors of the middle ages the christian church was in the living sense of the word peopled with a swarm of beings whom he believed to be entirely real prophets apostles anpels holy personages of every sort surrounding the incarnate word his mother and her spouse the eternal father all the martyrs and doctors of the church as they may be seen carved in high relief thronging the porches or lining the naves of the cathedrals out of all these m de charlus had chosen as his patrons and intercessors the archangels michael gabriel and raphael to whom he made frequent appeals that they would convey his prayers to the eternal father about whose throne they stand and so mme cottard’s mistake amused me greatly

   to leave the religious sphere let us mention that the doctor who had come to paris meagrely equipped with the counsels of a peasant mother and had then been absorbed in the almost purely materialistic studies to which those who seek to advance in a medical career are obliged to devote themselves for a great many years had never become cultured had acquired increasing authority but never any experience took the word ‘honoured’ in its literal meaning and was at once flattered by it because he was vain and distressed because he had a kind heart “that poor de charlus” he said to his wife that evening “made me feel sorry for him when he said he was honoured by travelling with us one feels poor devil that he knows nobody that he has to humble himself”

   but presently without any need to be guided by the charitable mme cottard the faithful had succeeded in overcoming the qualms which they had all more or less felt at first on finding themselves in the company of m de charlus no doubt in his presence they were incessantly reminded of ski’s revelations and conscious of the sexual abnormality embodied in their travelling companion but this abnormality itself had a sort of attraction for them it gave for them to the baron’s conversation remarkable in itself but in ways which they could scarcely appreciate a savour which made the most interesting conversation that of brichot himself appear slightly insipid in comparison from the very outset moreover they had been pleased to admit that he was intelligent “the genius that is perhaps akin to madness” the doctor declaimed and albeit the princess athirst for knowledge insisted said not another word this axiom being all that he knew about genius and seeming to him less supported by proof than our knowledge of typhoid fever and arthritis and as he had become proud and remained illbred “no questions princess do not interrogate me i am at the seaside for a rest besides you would not understand you know nothing about medicine” and the princess held her peace with apologies deciding that cottard was a charming man and realising that celebrities were not always approachable in this initial period then they had ended by finding m de charlus an agreeable person notwithstanding his vice or what is generally so named now it was quite unconsciously because of that vice that they found him more intelligent than the rest the most simple maxims to which adroitly provoked by the sculptor or the don m de charlus gave utterance concerning love jealousy beauty in view of the experience strange secret refined and monstrous upon which he founded them assumed for the faithful that charm of unfamiliarity with which a psychology analogous to that which our own dramatic literature has always offered us bedecks itself in a russian or japanese play performed by native actors one might still venture when he was not listening upon a malicious witticism at his expense “oh” whispered the sculptor seeing a young railwayman with the sweeping eyelashes of a dancing girl at whom m de charlus could not help staring “if the baron begins making eyes at the conductor we shall never get there the train will start going backwards just look at the way he’s staring at him this is not a steamtram we’re on it’s a funicular” but when all was said if m de charlus did not appear it was almost a disappointment to be travelling only with people who were just like everybody else and not to have by one’s side this painted paunchy tightlybuttoned personage reminding one of a box of exotic and dubious origin from which escapes the curious odour of fruits the mere thought of tasting which stirs the heart from this point of view the faithful of the masculine sex enjoyed a keener satisfaction in the short stage of the journey between saintmartin du chêne where m de charlus got in and doncières the station at which morel joined the party for so long as the violinist was not there and provided the ladies and albertine keeping to themselves so as not to disturb our conversation were out of hearing m de charlus made no attempt to appear to be avoiding certain subjects and did not hesitate to speak of ‘what it is customary to call degenerate morals’ albertine could not hamper him for she was always with the ladies like a wellbred girl who does not wish her presence to restrict the freedom of grownup conversation and i was quite resigned to not having her by my side on condition however that she remained in the same carriage for i who no longer felt any jealousy and scarcely any love for her never thought of what she might be doing on the days when i did not see her on the other hand when i was there a mere partition which might at a pinch be concealing a betrayal was intolerable to me and if she retired with the ladies to the next compartment a moment later unable to remain in my seat any longer at the risk of offending whoever might be talking brichot cottard or charlus to whom i could not explain the reason for my flight i would rise leave them without ceremony and to make certain that nothing abnormal was going on walk down the corridor and till we came to doncières m de charlus without any fear of shocking his audience would speak sometimes in the plainest terms of morals which he declared for his own part he did not consider either good or evil he did this from cunning to shew his breadth of mind convinced as he was that his own morals aroused no suspicion in the minds of the faithful he was well aware that there did exist in the world several persons who were to use an expression which became habitual with him later on ‘in the know’ about himself but he imagined that these persons were not more than three or four and that none of them was at that moment upon the coast of normandy this illusion may appear surprising in so shrewd so suspicious a man even in the case of those whom he believed to be more or less well informed he flattered himself that their information was all quite vague and hoped by telling them this or that fact about anyone to clear the person in question from all suspicion on the part of a listener who out of politeness pretended to accept his statements indeed being uncertain as to what i might know or guess about him he supposed that my opinion which he imagined to be of far longer standing than it actually was was quite general and that it was sufficient for him to deny this or that detail to be believed whereas on the contrary if our knowledge of the whole always precedes our knowledge of details it makes our investigation of the latter infinitely easier and having destroyed his cloak of invisibility no longer allows the pretender to conceal what he wishes to keep secret certainly when m de charlus invited to a dinnerparty by one of the faithful or of their friends took the most complicated precautions to introduce among the names of ten people whom he mentioned that of morel he never imagined that for the reasons always different which he gave for the pleasure or convenience which he would find that evening in being invited to meet him his hosts while appearing to believe him implicitly substituted a single reason always the same of which he supposed them to be ignorant namely that he was in love with him similarly mme verdurin seeming always entirely to admit the motives half artistic half charitable with which m de charlus accounted to her for the interest that he took in morel never ceased to thank the baron with emotion for his kindness — his touching kindness she called it — to the violinist and how astonished m de charlus would have been if one day when morel and he were delayed and had not come by the train he had heard the mistress say “we’re all here now except the young ladies” the baron would have been all the more stupefied in that going hardly anywhere save to la raspelière he played the part there of a family chaplain like the abbé in a stock company and would sometimes when morel had 48 hours’ leave sleep there for two nights in succession mme verdurin would then give them communicating rooms and to put them at their ease would say “if you want to have a little music don’t worry about us the walls are as thick as a fortress you have nobody else on your floor and my husband sleeps like lead” on such days m de charlus would relieve the princess of the duty of going to meet strangers at the station apologise for mme verdurin’s absence on the grounds of a state of health which he described so vividly that the guests entered the drawingroom with solemn faces and uttered cries of astonishment on finding the mistress up and doing and wearing what was almost a low dress

   for m de charlus had for the moment become for mme verdurin the faithfullest of the faithful a second princess sherbatoff of his position in society she was not nearly so certain as of that of the princess imagining that if the latter cared to see no one outside the little nucleus it was out of contempt for other people and preference for it as this pretence was precisely the verdurins’ own they treating as bores everyone to whose society they were not admitted it is incredible that the mistress can have believed the princess to possess a heart of steel detesting what was fashionable but she stuck to her guns and was convinced that in the case of the great lady also it was in all sincerity and from a love of things intellectual that she avoided the company of bores the latter were as it happened diminishing in numbers from the verdurins’ point of view life by the seaside robbed an introduction of the ulterior consequences which might be feared in paris brilliant men who had come down to balbec without their wives which made everything much easier made overtures to la raspelière and from being bores became too charming this was the case with the prince de guermantes whom the absence of his princess would not however have decided to go ‘as a bachelor’ to the verdurins’ had not the lodestone of dreyfusism been so powerful as to carry him in one stride up the steep ascent to la raspelière unfortunately upon a day when the mistress was not at home mme verdurin as it happened was not certain that he and m de charlus moved in the same world the baron had indeed said that the duc de guermantes was his brother but this was perhaps the untruthful boast of an adventurer man of the world as he had shewn himself to be so friendly so ‘faithful’ to the verdurins the mistress still almost hesitated to invite him to meet the prince de guermantes she consulted ski and brichot “the baron and the prince de guermantes will they be all right together” “good gracious madame as to one of the two i think i can safely say” “what good is that to me” mme verdurin had retorted crossly “i asked you whether they would mix well together” “ah madame that is one of the things that it is hard to tell” mme verdurin had been impelled by no malice she was certain of the baron’s morals but when she expressed herself in these terms had not been thinking about them for a moment but had merely wished to know whether she could invite the prince and m de charlus on the same evening without their clashing she had no malevolent intention when she employed these readymade expressions which are popular in artistic ‘little clans’ to make the most of m de guermantes she proposed to take him in the afternoon after her luncheonparty to a charity entertainment at which sailors from the neighbourhood would give a representation of a ship setting sail but not having time to attend to everything she delegated her duties to the faithfullest of the faithful the baron “you understand i don’t want them to hang about like mussels on a rock they must keep moving we must see them weighing anchor or whatever it’s called now you are always going down to the harbour at balbecplage you can easily arrange a dress rehearsal without tiring yourself you must know far more than i do m de charlus about getting hold of sailors but after all we’re giving ourselves a great deal of trouble for m de guermantes perhaps he’s only one of those idiots from the jockey club oh heavens i’m running down the jockey club and i seem to remember that you’re one of them eh baron you don’t answer me are you one of them you don’t care to come out with us look here is a book that has just come i think you’ll find it interesting it is by roujon the title is attractive life among men”

   for my part i was all the more glad that m de charlus often took the place of princess sherbatoff inasmuch as i was thoroughly in her bad books for a reason that was at once trivial and profound one day when i was in the little train paying every attention as was my habit to princess sherbatoff i saw mme de villeparisis get in she had as a matter of fact come down to spend some weeks with the princesse de luxembourg but chained to the daily necessity of seeing albertine i had never replied to the repeated invitations of the marquise and her royal hostess i felt remorse at the sight of my grandmother’s friend and purely from a sense of duty without deserting princess sherbatoff sat talking to her for some time i was as it happened entirely unaware that mme de villeparisis knew quite well who my companion was but did not wish to speak to her at the next station mme de villeparisis left the carriage indeed i reproached myself with not having helped her on to the platform i resumed my seat by the side of the princess but one would have thought — a cataclysm frequent among people whose position is far from stable and who are afraid that one may have heard something to their discredit and may be looking down upon them — that the curtain had risen upon a fresh scene buried in her revue des deux mondes madame sherbatoff barely moved her lips in reply to my questions and finally told me that i was making her head ache i had not the faintest idea of the nature of my crime when i bade the princess goodbye the customary smile did not light up her face her chin drooped in a dry acknowledgment she did not even offer me her hand nor did she ever speak to me again but she must have spoken — though what she said i cannot tell — to the verdurins for as soon as i asked them whether i ought not to say something polite to princess sherbatoff they replied in chorus “no nol no nothing of the sort she does not care for polite speeches” they did not say this to effect a breach between us but she had succeeded in making them believe that she was unmoved by civilities that hers was a spirit unassailed by the vanities of this world one needs to have seen the politician who was reckoned the most singleminded the most uncompromising the most unapproachable so long as he was in office one must have seen him in the hour of his disgrace humbly soliciting with a bright affectionate smile the haughty greeting of some unimportant journalist one must have seen cottard whom his new patients regarded as a rod of iron draw himself erect one must know out of what disappointments in love what rebuffs to snobbery were built up the apparent pride the universally acknowledged antisnobbery of princess sherbatoff in order to grasp that among the human race the rule — which admits of exceptions naturally — is that the reputedly hard people are weak people whom nobody wants and that the strong caring little whether they are wanted or not have alone that meekness which the common herd mistake for weakness

   however i ought not to judge princess sherbatoff severely her case is so common one day at the funeral of a guermantes a distinguished man who was standing next to me drew my attention to a slim person with handsome features “of all the guermantes” my neighbour informed me “that is the most astonishing the most singular he is the duke’s brother” i replied imprudently that he was mistaken that the gentleman in question who was in no way related to the guermantes was named journiersarlovèze the distinguished man turned his back upon me and has never even bowed to me since

   a great musician a member of the institute occupying a high official position who was acquainted with ski came to harambouville where he had a niece staying and appeared at one of the verdurins’ wednesdays m de charlus was especially polite to him at morel’s request principally in order that on his return to paris the academician might enable him to attend various private concerts rehearsals and so forth at which the violinist would be playing the academician who was flattered and was naturally a charming person promised and kept his promise the baron was deeply touched by all the consideration which this personage who for his own part was exclusively and passionately a lover of women shewed him all the facilities that he procured to enable him to see morel in those official quarters which the profane world may not enter all the opportunities by which the celebrated artist secured that the young virtuoso might shew himself might make himself known by naming him in preference to others of equal talent for auditions which were likely to make a special stir but m de charlus never suspected that he ought to be all the more grateful to the maestro in that the latter doubly deserving or if you prefer it guilty twice over was completely aware of the relations between the young violinist and his noble patron he favoured them certainly without any sympathy for them being unable to comprehend any other love than that for the woman who had inspired the whole of his music but from moral indifference a professional readiness to oblige social affability snobbishness as for his doubts as to the character of those relations they were so scanty that at his first dinner at la raspelière he had inquired of ski speaking of m de charlus and morel as he might have spoken of a man and his mistress “have they been long together” but too much the man of the world to let the parties concerned see what was in his mind prepared should any gossip arise among morel’s fellowstudents to rebuke them and to reassure morel by saying to him in a fatherly tone “one hears that sort of thing about everybody nowadays” he did not cease to load the baron with civilities which the latter thought charming but quite natural being incapable of suspecting the eminent maestro of so much vice or of so much virtue for the things that were said behind m de charlus’s back the expressions used about morel nobody was ever base enough to repeat to him and yet this simple situation is enough to shew that even that thing universally decried which would find no defender anywhere the breath of scandal has itself whether it be aimed at us and so become especially disagreeable to us or inform us of something about a third person of which we were unaware a psychological value of its own it prevents the mind from falling asleep over the fictitious idea that it has of what it supposes things to be when it is actually no more than their outward appearance it turns this appearance inside out with the magic dexterity of an idealist philosopher and rapidly presents to our gaze an unsuspected corner of the reverse side of the fabric how could m de charlus have imagined the remark made of him by a certain tender relative “how on earth can you suppose that mémé is in love with me you forget that i am a woman” and yet she was genuinely deeply attached to m de charlus why then need we be surprised that in the case of the verdurins whose affection and goodwill he had no title to expect the remarks which they made behind his back and they did not as we shall see confine themselves to remarks were so different from what he imagined them to be that is to say from a mere repetition of the remarks that he heard when he was present the latter alone decorated with affectionate inscriptions the little ideal tent to which m de charlus retired at times to dream by himself when he introduced his imagination for a moment into the idea that the verdurins held of him its atmosphere was so congenial so cordial the repose it offered so comforting that when m de charlus before going to sleep had withdrawn to it for a momentary relief from his worries he never emerged from it without a smile but for each one of us a tent of this sort has two sides as well as the side which we suppose to be the only one there is the other which is normally invisible to us the true front symmetrical with the one that we know but very different whose decoration in which we should recognise nothing of what weexpected to see would horrify us as being composed of the hateful symbols of an unsuspected hostility what a shock for m de charlus if he had found his way into one of these enemy tents by means of some piece of scandal as though by one of those service stairs where obscene drawings are scribbled outside the back doors of flats by unpaid tradesmen or dismissed servants but just as we do not possess that sense of direction with which certain birds are endowed so we lack the sense of our own visibility as we lack that of distances imagining as quite close to us the interested attention of the people who on the contrary never give us a thought and not suspecting that we are at the same time the sole preoccupation of others and so m de charlus lived in a state of deception like the fish which thinks that the water in which it is swimming extends beyond the glass wall of its aquarium which mirrors it while it does not see close beside it in the shadow the human visitor who is amusing himself by watching its movements or the allpowerful keeper who at the unforeseen and fatal moment postponed for the present in the case of the baron for whom the keeper in paris will be mme verdurin will extract it without compunction from the place in which it was happily living to cast it into another moreover the races of mankind in so far as they are not merely collections of individuals may furnish us with examples more vast but identical in each of their parts of this profound obstinate and disconcerting blindness up to the present if it was responsible for m de charlus’s discoursing to the little clan remarks of a wasted subtlety or of an audacity which made his listeners smile at him in secret it had not yet caused him nor was it to cause him at balbec any serious inconvenience a trace of albumen of sugar of cardiac arythmia does not prevent life from remaining normal for the man who is not even conscious of it when only the physician sees in it a prophecy of catastrophes in store at present the fondness — whether platonic or not — that m de charlus felt for morel merely led the baron to say spontaneously in morel’s absence that he thought him very good looking supposing that this would be taken in all innocence and thereby acting like a clever man who when summoned to make a statement before a court of law will not be afraid to enter into details which are apparently to his disadvantage but for that very reason are more natural and less vulgar than the conventional protestations of a stage culprit with the same freedom always between saintmartin du châne and doncièresouest — or conversely on the return journey — m de charlus would readily speak of men who had it appeared very strange morals and would even add “after all i say strange i don’t know why for there’s nothing so very strange about that” to prove to himself how thoroughly he was at his ease with his audience and so indeed he was provided that it was he who retained the initiative and that he knew his gallery to be mute and smiling disarmed by credulity or good manners

   when m de charlus was not speaking of his admiration for morel’s beauty as though it had no connexion with an inclination — called a vice — he would refer to that vice but as though he himself were in no way addicted to it sometimes indeed he did not hesitate to call it by its name as after examining the fine binding of his volume of balzac i asked him which was his favourite novel in the comédie humaine he replied his thoughts irresistibly attracted to the same topic “either one thing or the other a tiny miniature like the curé de tours and the femme abandonnée or one of the great frescoes like the series of illusions perdues what you’ve never read illusions perdues it’s wonderful the scene where carlos herrera asks the name of the château he is driving past and it turns out to be rastignac the home of the young man he used to love and then the abbé falls into a reverie which swann once called and very aptly the tristesse d’olympia of paederasty and the death of lucien i forgot who the man of taste was who when he was asked what event in his life had most distressed him replied ‘the death of lucien de rubempré in splendeurs et misères’” “i know that balzac is all the rage this year as pessimism was last” brichot interrupted “but at the risk of distressing the hearts that are smitten with the balzacian fever without laying any claim damme to being a policeman of letters or drawing up a list of offences against the laws of grammar i must confess that the copious improviser whose alarming lucubrations you appear to me singularly to overrate has always struck me as being an insufficiently meticulous scribe i have read these illusions perdues of which you are telling us baron flagellating myself to attain to the fervour of an initiate and i confess in all simplicity of heart that those serial instalments of bombastic balderdash written in double dutch — and in triple dutch esther heureuse où mènent les mauvais chemins a combien l’amour revient aux vieillards have always had the effect on me of the mystères de rocambole exalted by an inexplicable preference to the precarious position of a masterpiece” “you say that because you know nothing of life” said the baron doubly irritated for he felt that brichot would not understand either his aesthetic reasons or the other kind “i quite realise” replied brichot “that to speak like master françois rabelais you mean that i am moult sorbonagre sorbonicole et sorboniforme and yet just as much as any of the comrades i like a book to give an impression of sincerity and real life i am not one of those clerks    ” “the quart d’heure de rabelais” the doctor broke in with an air no longer of uncertainty but of assurance as to his own wit “    who take a vow of literature following the rule of the abbayeauxbois yielding obedience to m le vicomte de chateaubriand grand master of common form according to the strict rule of the humanists m le vicomte de chateaubriand’s mistake    ” “with fried potatoes” put in dr cottard “he is the patron saint of the brotherhood” continued brichot ignoring the wit of the doctor who on the other hand alarmed by the don’s phrase glanced anxiously at m de charlus brichot had seemed wanting in tact to cottard whose pun had brought a delicate smile to the lips of princess sherbatoff “with the professor the mordant irony of the complete sceptic never forfeits its rights” she said kindly to shew that the scientist’s witticism had not passed unperceived by herself “the sage is of necessity sceptical” replied the doctor “it’s not my fault gnothi seauton said socrates he was quite right excess in anything is a mistake but i am dumbfoundered when i think that those words have sufficed to keep socrates’s name alive all this time what is there in his philosophy very little when all is said when one reflects that charcot and others have done work a thousand times more remarkable work which moreover is at least founded upon something upon the suppression of the pupillary reflex as a syndrome of general paralysis and that they are almost forgotten after all socrates was nothing out of the common they were people who had nothing better to do and spent their time strolling about and splitting hairs like jesus christ ‘love one another’ it’s all very pretty” “my dear” mme cottard implored “naturally my wife protests women are all neurotic” “but my dear doctor i am not neurotic” murmured mme cottard “what she is not neurotic when her son is ill she exhibits phenomena of insomnia still i quite admit that socrates and all the rest of them are necessary for a superior culture to acquire the talent of exposition i always quote his gnothi seauton to my pupils at the beginning of the course père bouchard when he heard of it congratulated me” “i am not one of those who hold to form for form’s sake any more than i should treasure in poetry the rhyme millionaire” replied brichot “but all the same the comédie humaine — which is far from human — is more than the antithesis of those works in which the art exceeds the matter as that worthy hack ovid says and it is permissible to choose a middle course which leads to the presbytery of meudon or the hermitage of ferney equidistant from the valley of wolves in which rené superbly performed the duties of a merciless pontificate and from les jardies where honoré de balzac browbeaten by the bailiffs never ceased voiding upon paper to please a polish woman like a zealous apostle of balderdash”
    “chateaubriand is far more alive now than you say and balzac is after all a great writer” replied m de charlus still too much impregnated with swann’s tastes not to be irritated by brichot “and balzac was acquainted with even those passions which the rest of the world ignores or studies only to castigate them without referring again to the immortal illusions perdues sarrazine la fille aux yeux d’or une passion dans le désert even the distinctly enigmatic fausse maîtresse can be adduced in support of my argument when i spoke of this ‘unnatural’ aspect of balzac to swann he said to me ‘you are of the same opinion as taine’ i never had the honour of knowing monsieur taine” m de charlus continued with that irritating habit of inserting an otiose ‘monsieur’ to which people in society are addicted as though they imagine that by styling a great writer ‘monsieur’ they are doing him an honour perhaps keeping him at his proper distance and making it evident that they do not know him personally “i never knew monsieur taine but i felt myself greatly honoured by being of the same opinion as he” however in spite of these ridiculous social affectations m de charlus was extremely intelligent and it is probable that if some remote marriage had established a connexion between his family and that of balzac he would have felt no less than balzac himself for that matter a satisfaction which he would have been unable to help displaying as a praiseworthy sign of condescension

   now and again at the station after saintmartin du chêne some young men would get into the train m de charlus could not refrain from looking at them but as he cut short and concealed the attention that he was paying them he gave it the air of hiding a secret more personal even than his real secret one would have said that he knew them allowed his acquaintance to appear in spite of himself after he had accepted the sacrifice before turning again to us like children who in consequence of a quarrel among their respective parents have been forbidden to speak to certain of their schoolfellows but who when they meet them cannot forego the temptation to raise their heads before lowering them again before their tutor’s menacing cane

   at the word borrowed from the greek with which m de charlus in speaking of balzac had ended his comparison of the tristesse d’olympiowith the splendeurs et misères ski brichot and cottard had glanced at one another with a smile perhaps less ironical than stamped with that satisfaction which people at a dinnerparty would shew who had succeeded in making dreyfus talk about his own case or the empress eugénie about her reign they were hoping to press him a little further upon this subject but we were already at doncières where morel joined us in his presence m de charlus kept a careful guard over his conversation and when ski tried to bring it back to the love of carlos herrera for lucien de rubempré the baron assumed the vexed mysterious and finally seeing that nobody was listening to him severe and judicial air of a father who hears people saying something indecent in front of his daughter ski having shewn some determination to pursue the subject m de charlus his eyes starting out of his head raised his voice and said in a significant tone looking at albertine who as a matter of fact could not hear what we were saying being engaged in conversation with mme cottard and princess sherbatoff and with the suggestion of a double meaning of a person who wishes to teach illbred people a lesson “i think it is high time we began to talk of subjects that are likely to interest this young lady” but i quite realised that to him the young lady was not albertine but morel he proved as it happened later on the accuracy of my interpretation by the expressions that he employed when he begged that there might be no more of such conversation in front of morel “you know” he said to me speaking of the violinist “that he is not at all what you might suppose he is a very respectable youth who has always behaved himself he is very serious” and one gathered from these words that m de charlus regarded sexual inversion as a danger as menacing to young men as prostitution is to women and that if he employed the epithet ‘respectable’ of morel it was in the sense that it has when applied to a young shopgirl then brichot to change the conversation asked me whether i intended to remain much longer at incarville i had pointed out to him more than once but in vain that i was staying not at incarville but at balbec he always repeated the mistake for it was by the name of incarville or balbecincarville that he described this section of the coast there are people like that who speak of the same things as ourselves but call them by a slightly different name a certain lady of the faubourg saintgermain used invariably to ask me when she meant to refer to the duchesse de guermantes whether i had seen zénaïde lately or orianezénaïde the effect of which was that at first i did not understand her probably there had been a time when some relative of mme de guermantes being named oriane she herself to avoid confusion had been known as orianezénaïde perhaps too there had originally been a station only at incarville from which one went in a carriage to balbec “why what have you been talking about” said albertine astonished at the solemn paternal tone which m de charlus had suddenly adopted “about balzac” the baron hastily replied “and you are wearing this evening the very same clothes as the princesse de cadignan not her first gown which she wears at the dinnerparty but the second” this coincidence was due to the fact that in choosing albertine’s clothes i sought inspiration in the taste that she had acquired thanks to elstir who greatly appreciated a sobriety which might have been called british had it not been tempered with a gentler more flowing grace that was purely french as a rule the garments that he chose offered to the eye a harmonious combination of grey tones like the dress of diane de cadignan m de charlus was almost the only person capable of appreciating albertine’s clothes at their true value at a glance his eye detected what constituted their rarity justified their price he would never have said the name of one stuff instead of another and could always tell who had made them only he preferred — in women — a little more brightness and colour than elstir would allow and so this evening she cast a glance at me half smiling half troubled wrinkling her little pink cat’s nose indeed meeting over her skirt of grey crêpe de chine her jacket of grey cheviot gave the impression that albertine was dressed entirely in grey but making a sign to me to help her because her puffed sleeves needed to be smoothed down or pulled up for her to get into or out of her jacket she took it off and as her sleeves were of a scottish plaid in soft colours pink pale blue dull green pigeon’s breast the effect was as though in a grey sky there had suddenly appeared a rainbow and she asked herself whether this would find favour with m de charlus “ah” he exclaimed in delight “now we have a ray a prism of colour i offer you my sincerest compliments” “but it is this gentleman who has earned them” albertine replied politely pointing to myself for she liked to shew what she had received from me “it is only women who do not know how to dress that are afraid of colours” went on m de charlus “a dress may be brilliant without vulgarity and quiet without being dull besides you have not the same reasons as mme de cadignan for wishing to appear detached from life for that was the idea which she wished to instil into d’arthez by her grey gown” albertine who was interested in this mute language of clothes questioned m de charlus about the princesse de cadignan “ohl it is a charming tale” said the baron in a dreamy tone “i know the little garden in which diane de cadignan used to stroll with m d’espard it belongs to one of my cousins” “all this talk about his cousin’s garden” brichot murmured to cottard “may like his pedigree be of some importance to this worthy baron but what interest can it have for us who are not privileged to walk in it do not know the lady and possess no titles of nobility” for brichot had no suspicion that one might be interested in a gown and in a garden as works of art and that it was in the pages of balzac that m de charlus saw in his mind’s eye the garden paths of mme de cadignan the baron went on “but you know her” he said to me speaking of this cousin and by way of flattering me addressing himself to me as to a person who exiled amid the little clan was to m de charlus if not a citizen of his world at any rate a visitor to it “anyhow you must have seen her at mme de villeparisis’s” “is that the marquise de villeparisis who owns the chateau at baucreux” asked brichot with a captivated air “yes do you know her” inquired m de charlus dryly “no not at all” replied brichot “but our colleague norpois spends part of his holidays every year at baucreux i have had occasion to write to him there” i told morel thinking to interest him that m de norpois was a friend of my father but not a movement of his features shewed that he had heard me so little did he think of my parents so far short did they fall in his estimation of what my greatuncle had been who had employed morel’s father as his valet and as a matter of fact being unlike the rest of the family fond of not giving trouble had left a golden memory among his servants “it appears that mme de villeparisis is a superior woman but i have never been allowed to judge of that for myself nor for that matter have any of my colleagues for norpois who is the soul of courtesy and affability at the institute has never introduced any of us to the marquise i know of no one who has been received by her except our friend thureaudangin who had an old family connexion with her and also gaston boissier whom she was anxious to meet because of an essay which interested her especially he dined with her once and came back quite enthralled by her charm mme boissier however was not invited” at the sound of these names morel melted in a smile “ah thureaudangin” he said to me with an air of interest as great as had been his indifference when he heard me speak of the marquis de norpois and my father “thureaudangin why he and your uncle were as thick as thieves whenever a lady wanted a front seat for a reception at the academy your uncle would say ‘i shall write to thureaudangin’ and of course he got the ticket at once for you can understand that m thureaudangin would never have dared to refuse anything to your uncle who would have been certain to pay him out for it afterwards if he had i can’t help smiling either when i hear the name boissier for that was where your uncle ordered all the presents he used to give the ladies at the new year i know all about it because i knew the person he used to send for them” he had not only known him the person was his father some of these affectionate allusions by morel to my uncle’s memory were prompted by the fact that we did not intend to remain permanently in the hôtel de guermantes where we had taken an apartment only on account of my grandmother now and again there would be talk of a possible move now to understand the advice that charlie morel gave me in this connexion the reader must know that my greatuncle had lived in his day at 40bis boulevard malesherbes the consequence was that in the family as we were in the habit of frequently visiting my uncle adolphe until the fatal day when i made a breach between my parents and him by telling them the story of the lady in pink instead of saying ‘at your uncle’s’ we used to say ‘at 40bis’ if i were going to call upon some kinswoman i would be warned to go first of all ‘to 40bis’ in order that my uncle might not be offended by my not having begun my round with him he was the owner of the house and was i must say very particular as to the choice of his tenants all of whom either were or became his personal friends colonel the baron de vatry used to look in every day and smoke a cigar with him in the hope of making him consent to pay for repairs the carriage entrance was always kept shut if my uncle caught sight of a cloth or a rug hanging from one of the windowsills he would dash into the room and have it removed in less time than the police would take to do so nowadays all the same he did let part of the house reserving for himself only two floors and the stables in spite of this knowing that he was pleased when people praised the house we used always to talk of the comfort of the ‘little mansion’ as though my uncle had been its sole occupant and he allowed us to speak without uttering the formal contradiction that might have been expected the ‘little mansion’ was certainly comfortable my uncle having installed in it all the most recent inventions but there was nothing extraordinary about it only my uncle while saying with a false modesty ‘my little hovel’ was convinced or in any case had instilled into his valet the latter’s wife the coachman the cook the idea that there was no place in paris to compare for comfort luxury and general attractiveness with the little mansion charles morel had grown up in this belief nor had he outgrown it and so even on days when he was not talking to me if in the train i mentioned to anyone else the possibility of our moving at once he would smile at me and with a wink of connivance say “ah what you want is something in the style of 40bis that’s a place that would suit you down to the ground your uncle knew what he was about i am quite sure that in the whole of paris there’s nothing to compare with 40bis”

   the melancholy air which m de charlus had assumed in speaking of the princesse de cadignan left me in no doubt that the tale in question had not reminded him only of the little garden of a cousinto whom he was not particularly attached he became lost in meditation and as though he were talking to himself “the secrets of the princesse de cadignan” he exclaimed “what a masterpiece how profound how heartrending the evil reputation of diane who is afraid that the man she loves may hear of it what an eternal truth and more universal than might appear how far it extends” he uttered these words with a sadness in which nevertheless one felt that he found a certain charm certainly m de charlus unaware to what extent precisely his habits were or were not known had been trembling for some time past at the thought that when he returned to paris and was seen there in morel’s company the latter’s family might intervene and so his future happiness be jeopardised this eventuality had probably not appeared to him hitherto save as something profoundly disagreeable and painful but the baron was an artist to his finger tips and now that he had begun to identify his own position with that described by balzac he took refuge in a sense in the tale and for the calamity which was perhaps in store for him and did not in any case cease to alarm him he had the consolation of finding in his own anxiety what swann and also saintloup would have called something ‘quite balzacian’ this identification of himself with the princesse de cadignan had been made easy for m de charlus by virtue of the mental transposition which was becoming habitual with him and of which he had already furnished several examples it was enough in itself moreover to make the mere conversion of a woman as the beloved object into a young man immediately set in motion about him the whole sequence of social complications which develop round a normal love affair when for any reason we introduce once and for all time a change in the calendar or in the daily timetable if we make the year begin a few weeks later or if we make midnight strike a quarter of an hour earlier as the days will still consist of twentyfour hours and the months of thirty days everything that depends upon the measure of time will remain unaltered everything may have been changed without causing any disturbance since the ratio of the figures is still the same so it is with lives which adopt central european time or the eastern calendar it seems even that the gratification a man derives from keeping an actress played a part in these relations when after their first meeting m de charlus had made inquiries as to morel’s actual position he must certainly have learned that he was of humble extraction but a girl with whom we are in love does not forfeit our esteem because she is the child of poor parents on the other hand the well known musicians to whom he had addressed his inquiries had — and not even from any personal motive unlike the friends who when introducing swann to odette had described her to him as more difficult and more sought after than she actually was — simply in the stereotyped manner of men in a prominent position overpraising a beginner answered the baron “ah great talent has made a name for himself of course he is still quite young highly esteemed by the experts will go far” and with the mania which leads people who are innocent of inversion to speak of masculine beauty “besides it is charming to watch him play he looks better than anyone at a concert he has lovely hair holds himself so well his head is exquisite he reminds one of a violinist in a picture” and so m de charlus raised to a pitch of excitement moreover by morel himself who did not fail to let him know how many offers had been addressed to him was flattered by the prospect of taking him home with him of making a little nest for him to which he would often return for during the rest of the time he wished him to enjoy his freedom which was necessary to his career which m de charlus meant him however much money he might feel bound to give him to continue either because of the thoroughly ‘guermantes’ idea that a man ought to do something that he acquires merit only by his talent and that nobility or money is simply the additional cypher that multiplies a figure or because he was afraid lest having nothing to do and remaining perpetually in his company the violinist might grow bored moreover he did not wish to deprive himself of the pleasure which he found at certain important concerts in saying to himself “the person they are applauding at this moment is coming home with me tonight” fashionable people when they are in love and whatever the nature of their love apply their vanity to anything that may destroy the anterior advantages from which their vanity would have derived satisfaction

   morel feeling that i bore him no malice being sincerely attached to m de charlus and at the same time absolutely indifferent physically to both of us ended by treating me with the same display of warm friendship as a courtesan who knows that you do not desire her and that her lover has a sincere friend in you who will not attempt to part him from her not only did he speak to me exactly as rachel saintloup’s mistress had spoken to me long ago but what was more to judge by what m de charlus reported to me he used to say to him about me in my absence the same things that rachel had said about me to robert in fact m de charlus said to me “he likes you so much” as robert had said “she likes you so much” and just as the nephew on behalf of his mistress so it was on morel’s behalf that the uncle often invited me to come and dine with them there were for that matter just as many storms between them as there had been between robert and rachel to be sure after charlie morel had left us m de charlus would sing his praises without ceasing repeating — the thought of it was flattering to him — that the violinist was so good to him but it was evident nevertheless that often charlie even in front of all the faithful wore an irritated expression instead of always appearing happy and submissive as the baron would have wished this irritation became so violent in course of time owing to the weakness which led m de charlus to forgive morel his want of politeness that the violinist made no attempt to conceal if he did not even deliberately assume it i have seen m de charlus on entering a railway carriage in which morel was sitting with some of his soldier friends greeted with a shrug of the musician’s shoulders accompanied by a wink in the direction of his comrades or else he would pretend to be asleep as though this incursion bored him beyond words or he would begin to cough and the others would laugh derisively mimicking the affected speech of men like m de charlus would draw charlie into a corner from which he would return as though under compulsion to sit by m de charlus whose heart was pierced by all these cruelties it is inconceivable how he can have put up with them and these ever varied forms of suffering set the problem of happiness in fresh terms for m de charlus compelled him not only to demand more but to desire something else the previous combination being vitiated by a horrible memory and yet painful as these scenes came to be it must be admitted that at first the genius of the humble son of france traced for morel made him assume charming forms of simplicity of apparent frankness even of an independent pride which seemed to be inspired by disinterestedness this was not the case but the advantage of this attitude was all the more on morel’s side since whereas the person who is in love is continually forced to return to the charge to increase his efforts it is on the other hand easy for him who is not in love to proceed along a straight line inflexible and graceful it existed by virtue of the privilege of the race in the face — so open — of this morel whose heart was so tightly shut that face imbued with the neohellenic grace which blooms in the basilicas of champagne notwithstanding his affectation of pride often when he caught sight of m de charlus at a moment when he was not expecting to see him he would be embarrassed by the presence of the little clan would blush lower his eyes to the delight of the baron who saw in this an entire romance it was simply a sign of irritation and shame the former sometimes found expression for calm and emphatically decent as morel’s attitude generally was it was not without frequent contradictions sometimes indeed at something which the baron said to him morel would come out in the harshest tone with an insolent retort which shocked everybody m de charlus would lower his head with a sorrowful air make no reply and with that faculty which doting fathers possess of believing that the coldness the rudeness of their children has passed unnoticed would continue undeterred to sing the violinist’s praises m de charlus was not indeed always so submissive but as a rule his attempts at rebellion proved abortive principally because having lived among people in society in calculating the reactions that he might provoke he made allowance for the baser instincts whether original or acquired now instead of these he encountered in morel a plebeian tendency to spells of indifference unfortunately for m de charlus he did not understand that with morel everything else must give place when the conservatoire and the good reputation of the conservatoire but with this which was to be a more serious matter we are not at present concerned was in question thus for instance people of the middle class will readily change their surnames out of vanity noblemen for personal advantage to the young violinist on the contrary the name morel was inseparably linked with his first prize for the violin and so impossible to alter m de charlus would have liked morel to take everything from himself including a name going upon the facts that morel’s other name was charles which resembled charlus and that the place where they were in the habit of meeting was called les charmes he sought to persuade morel that a pleasant name easy to pronounce being half the battle for artistic fame the virtuoso ought without hesitation to take the name charmel a discreet allusion to the scene of their intimacy morel shrugged his shoulders as a conclusive argument m de charlus was unfortunately inspired to add that he had a footman of that name he succeeded only in arousing the furious indignation of the young man “there was a time when my ancestors were proud of the title of groom of butler to the king” “there was also a time” replied morel haughtily “when my ancestors cut off your ancestors’ heads” m de charlus would have been greatly surprised had he been told that even if abandoning the idea of ‘channel’ he made up his mind to adopt morel and to confer upon him one of the titles of the guermantes family which were at his disposal but which circumstances as we shall see did not permit him to offer the violinist the other would decline thinking of the artistic reputation attached to the name morel and of the things that would be said about him in ‘the class’ so far above the faubourg saintgermain did he place the rue bergère and so m de charlus was obliged to content himself with having symbolical rings made for morel bearing the antique device plvs vltra car’lvs certainly in the face of an adversary of a sort with which he was unfamiliar m de charlus ought to have changed his tactics but which of us is capable of that moreover if m de charlus made blunders morel was not guiltless of them either far more than the actual circumstance which brought about the rupture between them what was destined provisionally at least but this provisional turned out to be final to ruin him with m de charlus was that his nature included not only the baseness which made him lie down under harsh treatment and respond with insolence to kindness running parallel to this innate baseness there was in him a complicated neurasthenia of ill breeding which roused to activity on every occasion when he was in the wrong or was becoming a nuisance meant that at the very moment when he had need of all his politeness gentleness gaiety to disarm the baron he became sombre petulant tried to provoke discussions on matters where he knew that the other did not agree with him maintained his own hostile attitude with a weakness of argument and a slashing violence which enhanced that weakness for very soon running short of arguments he invented fresh ones as he went along in which he displayed the full extent of his ignorance and folly these were barely noticeable when he was in a friendly mood and sought only to please on the contrary nothing else was visible in his fits of sombre humour when from being inoffensive they became odious whereupon m de charlus felt that he could endure no more that his only hope lay in a brighter morrow while morel forgetting that the baron was enabling him to live in the lap of luxury gave an ironical smile of condescending pity and said “i have never taken anything from anybody which means that there is nobody to whom i owe a word of thanks”

   in the meantime and as though he had been dealing with a man of the world m de charlus continued to give vent to his rage whether genuine or feigned but in either case ineffective it was not always so however thus one day which must be placed as a matter of fact subsequent to this initial period when the baron was returning with charlie and myself from a luncheon party at the verdurins’ and expecting to spend the rest of the afternoon and the evening with the violinist at doncières the latter’s dismissal of him as soon as we left the train with “no i’ve an engagement” caused m de charlus so keen a disappointment that in spite of all his attempts to meet adversity with a brave face i saw the tears trickling down and melting the paint beneath his eyes as he stood helpless by the carriage door such was his grief that since we intended albertine and i to spend the rest of the day at doncières i whispered to her that i would prefer that we did not leave m de charlus by himself as he seemed i could not say why to be unhappy the dear girl readily assented i then asked m de charlus if he would not like me to accompany him for a little he also assented but declined to put my ‘cousin’ to any trouble i found a certain charm and one doubtless not to be repeated since i had made up my mind to break with her in saying to her quietly as though she were my wife “go back home by yourself i shall see you this evening” and in hearing her as a wife might give me permission to do as i thought fit and authorise me if m de charlus to whom she was attached needed my company to place myself at his disposal we proceeded the baron and i he waddling obesely his jesuitical eyes downcast and i following him to a café where we were given beer i felt m de charlus’s eyes turning uneasily towards the execution of some plan suddenly he called for paper and ink and began to write at an astonishing speed while he covered sheet after sheet his eyes glittered with furious fancies when he had written eight pages “may i ask you to do me a great service” he said to me “you will excuse my sealing this note i am obliged to do so you will take a carriage a motorcar if you can find one to get there as quickly as possible you are certain to find morel in his quarters where he has gone to change his clothes poor boy he tried to bluster a little when we parted but you may be sure that his heart is fuller than mine you will give him this note and if he asks you where you met me you will tell him that you stopped at doncières which for that matter is the truth to see robert which is not quite the truth perhaps but that you met me with a person whom you do not know that i seemed to be extremely angry that you thought you heard something about sending seconds i am as a matter of fact fighting a duel tomorrow whatever you do don’t say that i am asking for him don’t make any effort to bring him here but if he wishes to come with you don’t prevent him from doing so go my boy it is for his good you may be the means of averting a great tragedy while you are away i am going to write to my seconds i have prevented you from spending the afternoon with your cousin i hope that she will bear me no ill will for that indeed i am sure of it for hers is a noble soul and i know that she is one of the people who are strong enough not to resist the greatness of circumstances you must thank her on my behalf i am personally indebted to her and i am glad that it should be so” i was extremely sorry for m de charlus it seemed to me that charlie might have prevented this duel of which he was perhaps the cause and i was revolted if that were the case that he should have gone off with such indifference instead of staying to help his protector my indignation was increased when on reaching the house in which morel lodged i recognised the voice of the violinist who feeling the need of an outlet for his happiness was singing boisterously “some sunday morning when the weddingbells rrring” if poor m de charlus had heard him he who wished me to believe and doubtless believed himself that morel’s heart at that moment was full charlie began to dance with joy when he caught sight of me “hallo old boy i excuse me addressing you like that in this damned military life one picks up bad habits what luck seeing you i have nothing to do all evening do let’s go somewhere together we can stay here if you like or take a boat if you prefer that or we can have some music it’s all the same to me” i told him that i was obliged to dine at balbec he seemed anxious that i should invite him to dine there also but i refrained from doing so “but if you’re in such a hurry why have you come here” “i have brought you a note from m de charlus” at that moment all his gaiety vanished his face contracted “what he can’t leave me alone even here so i’m a slave am i old boy be a sport i’m not going to open his letter you can tell him that you couldn’t find me” “wouldn’t it be better to open it i fancy it contains something serious” “no certainly not you don’t know all the lies the infernal tricks that old scoundrel’s up to it’s a dodge to make me go and see him very well i’m not going i want to have an evening in peace” “but isn’t there going to be a duel tomorrow” i asked morel whom i supposed to be equally well informed “a duel” he repeated with an air of stupefaction “i never heard a word about it after all it doesn’t matter a damn to me the dirty old beast can go and get plugged in the guts if he likes but wait a minute this is interesting i’m going to look at his letter after all you can tell him that you left it here for me in case i should come in” while morel was speaking to me i was looking with amazement at the beautiful books which m de charlus had given him and which littered his room the violinist having refused to accept those labelled “i belong to the baron” etc a device which he felt to be insulting to himself as a mark of vassalage the baron with the sentimental ingenuity in which his illstarred love abounded had substituted others originated by his ancestors but ordered from the binder according to the circumstances of a melancholy friendship sometimes they were terse and confident as spes mea orexpectata non eludet sometimes merely resigned as j’attendrai others were gallant mesmes plaisir du mestre or counselled chastity such as that borrowed from the family of simiane sprinkled with azure towers and lilies and given a fresh meaning sustendant lilia turres others finally were despairing and appointed a meeting in heaven with him who had spurned the donor upon earth manet ultima caelo and finding the grapes which he had failed to reach too sour pretending not to have sought what he had not secured m de charlus said in one non mortale quod opto but i had not time to examine them all

   if m de charlus in dashing this letter down upon paper had seemed to be carried away by the demon that was inspiring his flying pen as soon as morel had broken the seal a leopard between two roses gules with the motto atavis et armis he began to read the letter as feverishly as m de charlus had written it and over those pages covered at breakneck speed his eye ran no less rapidly than the baron’s pen “good god” he exclaimed “this is the last straw but where am i to find him heaven only knows where he is now” i suggested that if he made haste he might still find him perhaps at a tavern where he had ordered beer as a restorative “i don’t know whether i shall be coming back” he said to his landlady and added in petto “it will depend on how the cat jumps” a few minutes later we reached the café i remarked m de charlus’s expression at the moment when he caught sight of me when he saw that i did not return unaccompanied i could feel that his breath his life were restored to him feeling that he could not get on that evening without morel he had pretended that somebody had told him that two officers of the regiment had spoken evil of him in connexion with the violinist and that he was going to send his seconds to call upon them morel had foreseen the scandal his life in the regiment made impossible and had hastened to the spot in doing which he had not been altogether wrong for to make his falsehood more plausible m de charlus had already written to two of his friends one was cottard asking them to be his seconds and if the violinist had not appeared we may be certain that in the frantic state in which m de charlus then was and to change his sorrow into rage he would have sent them with a challenge to some officer or other with whom it would have been a relief to him to fight during the interval m de charlus remembering that he came of a race that was of purer blood than the house of france told himself that it was really very good of him to take so much trouble over the son of a butler whose employer he would not have condescended to know on the other hand if his only amusement almost was now in the society of disreputable persons the profoundly ingrained habit which such persons have of not replying to a letter of failing to keep an appointment without warning you beforehand without apologising afterwards aroused in him since often enough his heart was involved such a wealth of emotion and the rest of the time caused him such irritation inconvenience and anger that he would sometimes begin to regret the endless letters over nothing at all the scrupulous exactitude of ambassadors and princes who even if unfortunately their personal charms left him cold gave him at any rate some sort of peace of mind accustomed to morel’s ways and knowing how little hold he had over him how incapable he was of insinuating himself into a life in which friendships that were vulgar but consecrated by force of habit occupied too much space and time to leave a stray hour for the great nobleman evicted proud and vainly imploring m de charlus was so convinced that the musician was not coming was so afraid of losing him for ever if he went too far that he could barely repress a cry of joy when he saw him appear but feeling himself the victor he felt himself bound to dictate the terms of peace and to extract from them such advantages as he might “what are you doing here” he said to him “and you” he went on gazing at myself “i told you whatever you did not to bring him back with you” “he didn’t want to bring me” said morel turning upon m de charlus in the artlessness of his coquetry a glance conventionally mournful and languorously oldfashioned with an air which he doubtless thought to be irresistible of wanting to kiss the baron and to burst into tears “it was i who insisted on coming in spite of him i come in the name of our friendship to implore you on my bended knees not to commit this rash act” m de charlus was wild with joy the reaction was almost too much for his nerves he managed however to control them “the friendship to which you appeal at a somewhat inopportune moment” he replied in a dry tone “ought on the contrary to make you support me when i decide that i cannot allow the impertinences of a fool to pass unheeded however even if i chose to yield to the prayers of an affection which i have known better inspired i should no longer be in a position to do so my letters to my seconds have been sent off and i have no doubt of their consent you have always behaved towards me like a little idiot and instead of priding yourself as you had every right to do upon the predilection which i had shewn for you instead of making known to the mob of serjeants or servants among whom the law of military service compels you to live what a source of incomparable satisfaction a friendship such as mine was to you you have sought to make excuses for yourself almost to make an idiotic merit of not being grateful enough i know that in so doing” he went on in order not to let it appear how deeply certain scenes had humiliated him “you are guilty merely of having let yourself be carried away by the jealousy of others but how is it that at your age you are childish enough and a child illbred enough not to have seen at once that your election by myself and all the advantages that must result for you from it were bound to excite jealousies that all your comrades while they egged you on to quarrel with me were plotting to take your place i have not thought it necessary to tell you of the letters that i have received in that connexion from all the people in whom you place most confidence i scorn the overtures of those flunkeys as i scorn their ineffective mockery the only person for whom i care is yourself since i am fond of you but affection has its limits and you ought to have guessed as much” harsh as the word flunkey might sound in the ears of morel whose father had been one but precisely because his father had been one the explanation of all social misadventures by ‘jealousy’ an explanation fatuous and absurd but of inexhaustible value which with a certain class never fails to ‘catch on’ as infallibly as the old tricks of the stage with a theatrical audience or the threat of the clerical peril in a parliament found in him an adherence hardly less solid than in françoise or the servants of mme de guermantes for whom jealousy was the sole cause of the misfortunes that beset humanity he had no doubt that his comrades had tried to oust him from his position and was all the more wretched at the thought of this disastrous albeit imaginary duel “oh how dreadful” exclaimed charlie “i shall never hold up my head again but oughtn’t they to see you before they go and call upon this officer” “i don’t know i suppose they ought i’ve sent word to one of them that i shall be here all evening and can give him his instructions” “i hope that before he comes i can make you listen to reason you will anyhow let me stay with you” morel asked him tenderly this was all that m de charlus wanted he did not however yield at once “you would do wrong to apply in this case the ‘whoso loveth well chasteneth well’ of the proverb for it is yourself whom i loved well and i intend to chasten even after our parting those who have basely sought to do you an injury until now their inquisitive insinuations when they dared to ask me how a man like myself could mingle with a boy of your sort sprung from the gutter i have answered only in the words of the motto of my la rochefoucauld cousins ‘’tis my pleasure’ i have indeed pointed out to you more than once that this pleasure was capable of becoming my chiefest pleasure without there resulting from your arbitrary elevation any degradation of myself” and in an impulse of almost insane pride he exclaimed raising his arms in the air “tantus ab uno splendor to condescend is not to descend” he went on in a calmer tone after this delirious outburst of pride and joy “i hope at least that my two adversaries notwithstanding their inferior rank are of a blood that i can shed without reproach i have made certain discreet inquiries in that direction which have reassured me if you retained a shred of gratitude towards me you ought on the contrary to be proud to see that for your sake i am reviving the bellicose humour of my ancestors saying like them in the event of a fatal issue now that i have learned what a little rascal you are ‘death to me is life’” and m de charlus said this sincerely not only because of his love for morel but because a martial instinct which he quaintly supposed to have come down to him from his ancestors filled him with such joy at the thought of fighting that this duel which he had originally invented with the sole object of making morel come to him he could not now abandon without regret he had never engaged in any affair of the sort without at once imagining himself the victor and identifying himself with the illustrious constable de guermantes whereas in the case of anyone else this same action of taking the field appeared to him to be of the utmost insignificance “i am sure it will be a fine sight” he said to us in all sincerity dwelling upon each word “to see sarah bernhardt in l’aiglon what is that but tripe mounetsully in oedipus tripe at the most it assumes a certain pallid transfiguration when it is performed in the arena of nîmes but what is it compared to that unimaginable spectacle the lineal descendant of the constable engaged in battle” and at the mere thought of such a thing m de charlus unable to contain himself for joy began to make passes in the air which recalled molière made us take the precaution of drawing our glasses closer and fear that when the swords crossed the combatants doctor and seconds would at once be wounded “what a tempting spectacle it would be for a painter you who know monsieur elstir” he said to me “you ought to bring him” i replied that he was not in the neighbourhood m de charlus suggested that he might be summoned by telegraph “oh i say it in his interest” he added in response to my silence “it is always interesting for a master — which he is in my opinion — to record such an instance of racial survival and they occur perhaps once in a century”

   but if m de charlus was enchanted at the thought of a duel which he had meant at first to be entirely fictitious morel was thinking with terror of the stories that might be spread abroad by the regimental band and might thanks to the stir that would be made by this duel penetrate to the holy of holies in the rue bergère seeing in his mind’s eye the ‘class’ fully informed he became more and more insistent with m de charlus who continued to gesticulate before the intoxicating idea of a duel he begged the baron to allow him not to leave him until the day after the next the supposed day of the duel so that he might keep him within sight and try to make him listen to the voice of reason so tender a proposal triumphed over m de charlus’s final hesitations he said that he would try to find a way out of it that he would postpone his final decision for two days in this fashion by not making any definite arrangement at once m de charlus knew that he could keep charlie with him for at least two days and make use of the time to fix future engagements with him in exchange for his abandoning the duel an exercise he said which in itself delighted him and which he would not forego without regret and in saying this he was quite sincere for he had always enjoyed taking the field when it was a question of crossing swords or exchanging shots with an adversary cottard arrived at length although extremely late for delighted to act as second but even more upset by the prospect he had been obliged to halt at all the cafés or farms by the way asking the occupants to be so kind as to shew him the way to ‘no 100’ or ‘a certain place’ as soon as he arrived the baron took him into another room for he thought it more correct that charlie and i should not be present at the interview and excelled in making the most ordinary room serve for the time being as throneroom or council chamber when he was alone with cottard he thanked him warmly but informed him that it seemed probable that the remark which had been repeated to him had never really been made and requested that in view of this the doctor would be so good as let the other second know that barring possible complications the incident might be regarded as closed now that the prospect of danger was withdrawn cottard was disappointed he was indeed tempted for a moment to give vent to anger but he remembered that one of his masters who had enjoyed the most successful medical career of his generation having failed to enter the academy at his first election by two votes only had put a brave face on it and had gone and shaken hands with his successful rival and so the doctor refrained from any expression of indignation which could have made no difference and after murmuring he the most timorous of men that there were certain things which one could not overlook added that it was better so that this solution delighted him m de charlus desirous of shewing his gratitude to the doctor just as the duke his brother would have straightened the collar of my father’s greatcoat or rather as a duchess would put her arm round the waist of a plebeian lady brought his chair close to the doctor’s notwithstanding the dislike that he felt for the other and not only without any physical pleasure but having first to overcome a physical repulsion as a guermantes not as an invert in taking leave of the doctor he clasped his hand and caressed it for a moment with the affection of a rider rubbing his horse’s nose and giving it a lump of sugar but cottard who had never allowed the baron to see that he had so much as heard the vaguest rumours as to his morals but nevertheless regarded him in his private judgment as one of the class of ‘abnormals’ indeed with his habitual inaccuracy in the choice of terms and in the most serious tone he said of one of m verdurin’s footmen “isn’t he the baron’s mistress” persons of whom he had little personal experience imagined that this stroking of his hand was the immediate prelude to an act of violence in anticipation of which the duel being a mere pretext he had been enticed into a trap and led by the baron into this remote apartment where he was about to be forcibly outraged not daring to stir from his chair to which fear kept him glued he rolled his eyes in terror as though he had fallen into the hands of a savage who for all he could tell fed upon human flesh at length m de charlus releasing his hand and anxious to be hospitable to the end said “won’t you come and take something with us as the saying is what in the old days used to be called a mazagran or a gloria drinks that are no longer to be found as archaeological curiosities except in the plays of labiche and the cafés of doncières a gloria would be distinctly suitable to the place eh and to the occasion what do you say” “i am president of the antialcohol league” replied cottard “some country sawbones has only got to pass and it will be said that i do not practise what i preach os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri” he added not that this had any bearing on the matter but because his stock of latin quotations was extremely limited albeit sufficient to astound his pupils m de charlus shrugged his shoulders and led cottard back to where we were after exacting a promise of secrecy which was all the more important to him since the motive for the abortive duel was purely imaginary it must on no account reach the ears of the officer whom he had arbitrarily selected as his adversary while the four of us sat there drinking mme cottard who had been waiting for her husband outside where m de charlus could see her quite well though he had made no effort to summon her came in and greeted the baron who held out his hand to her as though to a housemaid without rising from his chair partly in the manner of a king receiving homage partly as a snob who does not wish a woman of humble appearance to sit down at his table partly as an egoist who enjoys being alone with his friends and does not wish to be bothered so mme cottard remained standing while she talked to m de charlus and her husband but possibly because politeness the knowledge of what ‘ought to be done’ is not the exclusive privilege of the guermantes and may all of a sudden illuminate and guide the most uncertain brains or else because himself constantly unfaithful to his wife cottard felt at odd moments as a sort of compensation the need to protect her against anyone else who failed in his duty to her the doctor quickly frowned a thing i had never seen him do before and without consulting m de charlus said in a tone of authority “come léontine don’t stand about like that sit down” “but are you sure i’m not disturbing you” mme cottard inquired timidly of m de charlus who surprised by the doctor’s tone had made no observation whereupon without giving him a second chance cottard repeated with authority “i told you to sit down”

   presently the party broke up and then m de charlus said to morel “i conclude from all this business which has ended more happily than you deserved that you are incapable of looking after yourself and that at the expiry of your military service i must lead you back myself to your father like the archangel raphael sent by god to the young tobias” and the baron began to smile with an air of grandeur and a joy which morel to whom the prospect of being thus led home afforded no pleasure did not appear to share in the exhilaration of comparing himself to the archangel and morel to the son of tobit m de charlus no longer thought of the purpose of his speech which had been to explore the ground and see whether as he hoped morel would consent to come with him to paris intoxicated with his love or with his selflove the baron did not see or pretended not to see the violinist’s wry grimace for leaving him by himself in the café he said to me with a proud smile “did you notice how when i compared him to the son of tobit he became wild with joy that was because being extremely intelligent he at once understood that the father in whose company he was henceforth to live was not his father after the flesh who must be some horrible valet with moustaches but his spiritual father that is to say myself what a triumph for him how proudly he reared his head what joy he felt at having understood me i am sure that he will now repeat day by day ‘o god who didst give the blessed archangel raphael as guide to thy servant tobias upon a long journey grant to us thy servants that we may ever be protected by him and armed with his succour’ i had no need even” added the baron firmly convinced that he would one day sit before the throne of god “to tell him that i was the heavenly messenger he realised it for himself and was struck dumb with joy” and m de charlus whom his joy on the contrary did not deprive of speech regardless of the passersby who turned to stare at him supposing that he must be a lunatic cried out by himself and at the top of his voice raising his hands in the air “alleluia”

   this reconciliation gave but a temporary respite to m de charlus’s torments often when morel had gone out on training too far away for m de charlus to be able to go and visit him or to send me to talk to him he would write the baron desperate and affectionate letters in which he assured him that he was going to put an end to his life because owing to a ghastly affair he must have twentyfive thousand francs he did not mention what this ghastly affair was and had he done so it would doubtless have been an invention as far as the money was concerned m de charlus would willingly have sent him it had he not felt that it would make charlie independent of him and free to receive the favours of some one else and so he refused and his telegrams had the dry cutting tone of his voice when he was certain of their effect he hoped that morel would never forgive him for knowing very well that it was the contrary that would happen he could not help dwelling upon all the drawbacks that would be revived with this inevitable tie but if no answer came from morel he lay awake all night had not a moment’s peace so great is the number of the things of which we live in ignorance and of the interior and profound realities that remain hidden from us and so he would form every conceivable supposition as to the enormity which put morel in need of twentyfive thousand francs gave it every possible shape labelled it with one after another many proper names i believe that at such moments m de charlus in spite of the fact that his snobbishness which was now diminishing had already been overtaken if not outstripped by his increasing curiosity as to the ways of the lower orders must have recalled with a certain longing the lovely manycoloured whirl of the fashionable gatherings at which the most charming men and women sought his company only for the disinterested pleasure that it afforded them where nobody would have dreamed of ‘doing him down’ of inventing a ‘ghastly affair’ on the strength of which one is prepared to take one’s life if one does not at once receive twentyfive thousand francs i believe that then and perhaps because he had after all remained more ‘combray’ at heart than myself and had grafted a feudal dignity upon his germanic pride he must have felt that one cannot with impunity lose one’s heart to a servant that the lower orders are by no means the same thing as society that in short he did not ‘get on’ with the lower orders as i have always done

   the next station upon the little railway maineville reminds me of an incident in which morel and m de charlus were concerned before i speak of it i ought to mention that the halt of the train at maineville when one was escorting to balbec a fashionable stranger who to avoid giving trouble preferred not to stay at la raspelière was the occasion of scenes less painful than that which i am just about to describe the stranger having his light luggage with him in the train generally found that the grand hotel was rather too far away but as there was nothing until one came to balbec except small bathing places with uncomfortable villas had yielding to a preference for comfortable surroundings resigned himself to the long journey when as the train came to a standstill at maineville he saw the palace staring him in the face and never suspected that it was a house of ill fame “but don’t let us go any farther” he would invariably say to mme cottard a woman wellknown for her practical judgment and sound advice “there is the very thing i want what is the use of going on to balbec where i certainly shan’t find anything better i can tell at a glance that it has all the modern comforts i can quite well invite mme verdurin there for i intend in return for her hospitality to give a few little parties in her honour she won’t have so far to come as if i stay at balbec this seems to me the very place for her and for your wife my dear professor there are bound to be sitting rooms we can have the ladies there between you and me i can’t imagine why mme verdurin didn’t come and settle here instead of taking la raspelière it is far healthier than an old house like la raspelière which is bound to be damp and is not clean either they have no hot water laid on one can never get a wash now maineville strikes me as being far more attractive mme verdurin would have played the hostess here to perfection however tastes differ i intend anyhow to remain here mme cottard won’t you come along with me we shall have to be quick for the train will be starting again in a minute you can pilot me through that house which you must know inside out for you must often have visited it it is the ideal setting for you” the others would have the greatest difficulty in making the unfortunate stranger hold his tongue and still more in preventing him from leaving the train while he with the obstinacy which often arises from a blunder insisted gathered his luggage together and refused to listen to a word until they had assured him that neither mme verdurin nor mme cottard would ever come to call upon him there “anyhow i am going to make my headquarters there mme verdurin has only to write if she wishes to see me”

   the incident that concerns morel was of a more highly specialised order there were others but i confine myself at present as the train halts and the porter calls out ‘doncières’ ‘grattevast’ ‘maineville’ etc to noting down the particular memory that the wateringplace or garrison town recalls to me i have already mentioned maineville media villa and the importance that it had acquired from that luxurious establishment of women which had recently been built there not without arousing futile protests from the mothers of families but before i proceed to say why maineville is associated in my memory with morel and m de charlus i must make a note of the disproportion which i shall have occasion to examine more thoroughly later on between the importance that morel attached to keeping certain hours free and the triviality of the occupations to which he pretended to devote to them this same disproportion recurring amid the explanations of another sort which he gave to m de charlus he who played the disinterested artist for the baron’s benefit and might do so without risk in view of the generosity of his protector when he wished to have the evening to himself in order to give a lesson etc never failed to add to his excuse the following words uttered with a smile of cupidity “besides there may be forty francs to be got out of it that’s always something you will let me go for don’t you see it’s all to my advantage damn it all i haven’t got a regular income like you i have my way to make in the world it’s a chance of earning a little money” morel in professing his anxiety to give his lesson was not altogether insincere for one thing it is false to say that money has no colour a new way of earning them gives a fresh lustre to coins that are tarnished with use had he really gone out to give a lesson it is probable that a couple of louis handed to him as he left the house by a girl pupil would have produced a different effect on him from a couple of louis coming from the hand of m de charlus besides for a couple of louis the richest of men would travel miles which become leagues when one is the son of a valet but frequently m de charlus had his doubts as to the reality of the violin lesson doubts which were increased by the fact that often the musician pleaded excuses of another sort entirely disinterested from the material point of view and at the same time absurd in this morel could not help presenting an image of his life but one that deliberately and unconsciously too he so darkened that only certain parts of it could be made out for a whole month he placed himself at m de charlus’s disposal on condition that he might keep his evenings free for he was anxious to put in a regular attendance at a course of algebra come and see m de charlus after the class oh that was impossible the classes went on sometimes very late “even after two o’clock in the morning” the baron asked “sometimes” “but you can learn algebra just as easily from a book” “more easily for i don’t get very much out of the lectures” “very well then besides algebra can’t be of any use to you” “i like it it soothes my nerves” “it cannot be algebra that makes him ask leave to go out at night” m de charlus said to himself “can he be working for the police” in any case morel whatever objection might be made reserved certain evening hours whether for algebra or for the violin on one occasion it was for neither but for the prince de guermantes who having come down for a few days to that part of the coast to pay the princesse de luxembourg a visit picked up the musician without knowing who he was or being recognised by him either and offered him fifty francs to spend the night with him in the brothel at maineville a twofold pleasure for morel in the profit received from m de guermantes and in the delight of being surrounded by women whose sunburned breasts would be visible to the naked eye in some way or other m de charlus got wind of what had occurred and of the place appointed but did not discover the name of the seducer mad with jealousy and in the hope of finding out who he was he telegraphed to jupien who arrived two days later and when early in the following week morel announced that he would again be absent the baron asked jupien if he would undertake to bribe the woman who kept the establishment and make her promise to hide the baron and himself in some place where they could witness what occurred “that’s all right i’ll see to it dearie” jupien assured the baron it is hard to imagine to what extent this anxiety was agitating and by so doing had momentarily enriched the mind of m de charlus love is responsible in this way for regular volcanic upheavals of the mind in his which a few days earlier resembled a plain so uniform that as far as the eye could reach it would have been impossible to make out an idea rising above the level surface there had suddenly sprung into being hard as stone a chain of mountains but mountains as elaborately carved as if some sculptor instead of quarrying and carting his marble from them had chiselled it on the spot in which there writhed in vast titanic groups fury jealousy curiosity envy hatred suffering pride terror and love

   meanwhile the evening on which morel was to be absent had come jupien’s mission had proved successful he and the baron were to be there about eleven o’clock and would be put in a place of concealment when they were still three streets away from this gorgeous house of prostitution to which people came from all the fashionable resorts in the neighbourhood m de charlus had begun to walk upon tiptoe to disguise his voice to beg jupien not to speak so loud lest morel should hear them from inside whereas on creeping stealthily into the entrance hall m de charlus who was not accustomed to places of the sort found himself to his terror and amazement in a gathering more clamorous than the stock exchange or a sale room it was in vain that he begged the girls who gathered round him to moderate their voices for that matter their voices were drowned by the stream of announcements and awards made by an old ‘assistant matron’ in a very brown wig her face crackled with the gravity of a spanish attorney or priest who kept shouting at every minute in a voice of thunder ordering the doors to be alternately opened and shut like a policeman regulating the flow of traffic “take this gentleman to twentyeight the spanish room” “let no more in” “open the door again these gentlemen want mademoiselle noémie she’s expecting them in the persian parlour” m de charlus was as terrified as a countryman who has to cross the boulevards while to take a simile infinitely less sacrilegious than the subject represented on the capitals of the porch of the old church of corleville the voices of the young maids repeated in a lower tone unceasingly the assistant matron’s orders like the catechisms that we hear schoolchildren chanting beneath the echoing vault of a parish church in the country however great his alarm m de charlus who in the street had been trembling lest he should make himself heard convinced in his own mind that morel was at the window was perhaps not so frightened after all in the din of those huge staircases on which one realised that from the rooms nothing could be seen coming at length to the end of his calvary he found mlle noémie who was to conceal him with jupien but began by shutting him up in a sumptuously furnished persian sittingroom from which he could see nothing at all she told him that morel had asked for some orangeade and that as soon as he was served the two visitors would be taken to a room with a transparent panel in the meantime as some one was calling for her she promised them like a fairy godmother that to help them to pass the time she was going to send them a ‘clever little lady’ for she herself was called away the clever little lady wore a persian wrapper which she proposed to remove m de charlus begged her to do nothing of the sort and she rang for champagne which cost 40 francs a bottle morel as a matter of fact was during this time with the prince de guermantes he had for form’s sake pretended to go into the wrong room by mistake had entered one in which there were two women who had made haste to leave the two gentlemen undisturbed m de charlus knew nothing of this but was fidgeting with rage trying to open the doors sent for mlle noémie who hearing the clever little lady give m de charlus certain information about morel which was not in accordance with what she herself had told jupien banished her promptly and sent presently as a substitute for the clever little lady a ‘dear little lady’ who exhibited nothing more but told them how respectable the house was and called like her predecessor for champagne the baron foaming with rage sent again for mlle noémie who said to them “yes it is taking rather long the ladies are doing poses he doesn’t look as if he wanted to do anything” finally yielding to the promises the threats of the baron mlle noémie went away with an air of irritation assuring them that they would not be kept waiting more than five minutes the five minutes stretched out into an hour after which noémie came and tiptoed in front of m de charlus blind with rage and jupien plunged in misery to a door which stood ajar telling them “you’ll see splendidly from here however it’s not very interesting just at present he is with three ladies he is telling them about life in his regiment” at length the baron was able to see through the cleft of the door and also the reflexion in the mirrors beyond but a deadly terror forced him to lean back against the wall it was indeed morel that he saw before him but as though the pagan mysteries and enchantments still existed it was rather the shade of morel morel embalmed not even morel restored to life like lazarus an apparition of morel a phantom of morel morel ‘walking’ or ‘called up’ in that room in which the walls and couches everywhere repeated the emblems of sorcery that was visible a few feet away from him in profile morel had as though he were already dead lost all his colour among these women with whom one might have expected him to be making merry he remained livid fixed in an artificial immobility to drink the glass of champagne that stood before him his arm sapped of its strength tried in vain to reach out and dropped back again one had the impression of that ambiguous state implied by a religion which speaks of immorality but means by it something that does not exclude annihilation the women were plying him with questions “you see” mlle noémie whispered to the baron “they are talking to him about his life in the regiment it’s amusing isn’t it”— here she laughed —“you’re glad you came he is calm isn’t he” she added as though she were speaking of a dying man the women’s questions came thick and fast but morel inanimate had not the strength to answer them even the miracle of a whispered word did not occur m de charlus hesitated for barely a moment before he grasped what had really happened namely that whether from clumsiness on jupien’s part when he had called to make the arrangements or from the expansive power of a secret lodged in any breast which means that no secret is ever kept or from the natural indiscretion of these ladies or from their fear of the police morel had been told that two gentlemen had paid a large sum to be allowed to spy on him unseen hands had spirited away the prince de guermantes metamorphosed into three women and had placed the unhappy morel trembling paralysed with fear in such a position that if m de charlus had but a poor view of him he terrorised speechless not daring to lift his glass for fear of letting it fall had a perfect view of the baron

   the story moreover had no happier ending for the prince de guermantes when he had been sent away so that m de charlus should not see him furious at his disappointment without suspecting who was responsible for it he had implored morel still without letting him know who he was to make an appointment with him for the following night in the tiny villa which he had taken and which despite the shortness of his projected stay in it he had obeying the same insensate habit which we have already observed in mme de villeparisis decorated with a number of family keepsakes so that he might feel more at home and so next day morel turning his head every moment trembling with fear of being followed and spied upon by m de charlus had finally having failed to observe any suspicious passerby entered the villa a valet shewed him into the sittingroom telling him that he would inform ‘monsieur’ his master had warned him not to utter the word ‘prince’ for fear of arousing suspicions but when morel found himself alone and went to the mirror to see that his forelock was not disarranged he felt as though he were the victim of a hallucination the photographs on the mantelpiece which the violinist recognised for he had seen them in m de charlus’s room of the princesse de guermantes the duchesse de luxembourg mme de villeparisis left him at first petrified with fright at the same moment he caught sight of the photograph of m de charlus which was placed a little behind the rest the baron seemed to be concentrating upon morel a strange fixed glare mad with terror morel recovering from his first stupor never doubting that this was a trap into which m de charlus had led him in order to put his fidelity to the test sprang at one bound down the steps of the villa and set off along the road as fast as his legs would carry him and when the prince thinking he had kept a casual acquaintance waiting sufficiently long and not without asking himself whether it were quite prudent and whether the person might not be dangerous entered the room he found nobody there in vain did he and his valet afraid of burglary and armed with revolvers search the whole house which was not large every corner of the garden the basement the companion of whose presence he had been certain had completely vanished he met him several times in the course of the week that followed but on each occasion it was morel the dangerous person who turned tail and fled as though the prince were more dangerous still confirmed in his suspicions morel never outgrew them and even in paris the sight of the prince de guermantes was enough to make him take to his heels whereby m de charlus was protected from a betrayal which filled him with despair and avenged without ever having imagined such a thing still less how it came about

   but already my memories of what i have been told about all this are giving place to others for the b a g resuming its slow crawl continues to set down or take up passengers at the following stations

   at grattevast where his sister lived with whom he had been spending the afternoon there would sometimes appear m pierre de verjus comte de crécy who was called simply the comte de crécy a gentleman without means but of the highest nobility whom i had come to know through the cambremers although he was by no means intimate with them as he was reduced to an extremely modest almost a penurious existence i felt that a cigar a ‘drink’ were things that gave him so much pleasure that i formed the habit on the days when i could not see albertine of inviting him to balbec a man of great refinement endowed with a marvellous power of selfexpression snowwhite hair and a pair of charming blue eyes he generally spoke in a faint murmur very delicately of the comforts of life in a country house which he had evidently known from experience and also of pedigrees on my inquiring what was the badge engraved on his ring he told me with a modest smile “it is a branch of verjuice” and he added with a relish as though sipping a vintage “our arms are a branch of verjuice — symbolic since my name is verjus — slipped and leaved vert” but i fancy that he would have been disappointed if at balbec i had offered him nothing better to drink than verjuice he liked the most expensive wines because he had had to go without them because of his profound knowledge of what he was going without because he had a palate perhaps also because he had an exorbitant thirst and so when i invited him to dine at balbec he would order the meal with a refinement of skill but ate a little too much and drank copiously made them warm the wines that needed warming place those that needed cooling upon ice before dinner and after he would give the right date or number for a port or an old brandy as he would have given the date of the creation of a marquisate which was not generally known but with which he was no less familiar

   as i was in airne’s eyes a favoured customer he was delighted that i should give these special dinners and would shout to the waiters “quick lay number 25” he did not even say ‘lay’ but ‘lay me’ as though the table were for his own use and as the language of head waiters is not quite the same as of that of subheads assistants boys and so forth when the time came for me to ask for the bill he would say to the waiter who had served us making a continuous soothing gesture with the back of his hand as though he were trying to calm a horse that was ready to take the bit in its teeth “don’t go too fast” in adding up the bill “go gently very gently” then as the waiter was retiring with this guidance aimé fearing lest his recommendations might not be carried out to the letter would call him back “here let me make it out” and as i told him not to bother “it’s one of my principles that we ought never as the saying is to sting a customer” as for the manager since my guest was attired simply always in the same clothes which were rather threadbare albeit nobody would so well have practised the art of dressing expensively like one of balzac’s dandies had he possessed the means he confined himself out of respect for me to watching from a distance to see that everything was all right and ordering with a glance a wedge to be placed under one leg of the table which was not steady this was not to say that he was not qualified though he concealed his early struggles to lend a hand like anyone else it required some exceptional circumstance nevertheless to induce him one day to carve the turkeypoults himself i was out but i heard afterwards that he carved them with a sacerdotal majesty surrounded at a respectful distance from the servicetable by a ring of waiters who were endeavouring thereby not so much to learn the art as to make themselves conspicuously visible and stood gaping in openmouthed admiration visible to the manager for that matter as he plunged a slow gaze into the flanks of his victims and no more removed his eyes filled with a sense of his exalted mission from them than if he had been expected to read in them some augury they were certainly not the hierophant was not conscious of my absence even when he heard of it he was distressed “what you didn’t see me carving the turkeypoults myself” i replied that having failed so far to see rome venice siena the prado the dresden gallery the indies sarah in phèdre i had learned to resign myself and that i would add his carving of turkeypoults to my list the comparison with the dramatic art sarah in phèdre was the only one that he seemed to understand for he had already been told by me that on days of gala performances the elder coquelin had accepted a beginner’s parts even that of a character who says but a single line or nothing at all “it doesn’t matter i am sorry for your sake when shall i be carving again it will need some great event it will need a war” it did as a matter of fact need the armistice from that day onwards the calendar was changed time was reckoned thus “that was the day after the day i carved the turkeys myself” “that’s right a week after the manager carved the turkeys himself” and so this prosectomy furnished like the nativity of christ or the hegira the starting point for a calendar different from the rest but neither so extensively adopted nor so long observed

   the sadness of m de crécy’s life was due just as much as to his no longer keeping horses and a succulent table to his mixing exclusively with people who were capable of supposing that cambremers and guermantes were one and the same thing when he saw that i knew that legrandin who had now taken to calling himself legrand de méséglise had no sort of right to that name being moreover heated by the wine that he was drinking he broke out in a transport of joy his sister said to me with an understanding air “my brother is never so happy as when he has a chance of talking to you” he felt indeed that he was alive now that he had discovered somebody who knew the unimportance of the cambremers and the greatness of the guermantes somebody for whom the social universe existed so after the burning of all the libraries on the face of the globe and the emergence of a race entirely unlettered an old latin scholar would recover his confidence in life if he heard somebody quoting a line of horace and so if he never left the train without saying to me “when is our next little gathering” it was not so much with the hunger of a parasite as with the gluttony of a savant and because he regarded our symposia at balbec as an opportunity for talking about subjects which were precious to him and of which he was never able to talk to anyone else and analogous in that way to those dinners at which assemble on certain specified dates round the particularly succulent board of the union club the society of bibliophiles he was extremely modest so far as his own family was concerned and it was not from m de crécy that i learned that it was a very great family indeed and a genuine branch transplanted to france of the english family which bears the title of crecy when i learned that he was a true crécy i told him that one of mme de guermantes’s nieces had married an american named charles crecy and said that i did not suppose there was any connexion between them “none” he said “any more than — not of course that my family is so distinguished — heaps of americans who call themselves montgomery berry chandos or capel have with the families of pembroke buckingham or essex or with the duc de berry” i thought more than once of telling him as a joke that i knew mme swann who as a courtesan had been known at one time by the name odette de crécy but even if the duc d’alencon had shewn no resentment when people mentioned in front of him émilienne d’alencon i did not feel that i was on sufficiently intimate terms with m de crécy to carry a joke so far “he comes of a very great family” m de montsurvent said to me one day “his family name is saylor” and he went on to say that on the wall of his old castle above incarville which was now almost uninhabitable and which he although born to a great fortune was now too much impoverished to put in repair was still to be read the old motto of the family i thought this motto very fine whether applied to the impatience of a predatory race niched in that eyrie from which its members must have swooped down in the past or at the present day to its contemplation of its own decline awaiting the approach of death in that towering grim retreat it is indeed in this double sense that this motto plays upon the name saylor in the words “ne sçais l’heure”

   at hermenonville there would get in sometimes m de chevregny whose name brichot told us signified like that of mgr de cabrières a place where goats assemble he was related to the cambremers for which reason and from a false idea of what was fashionable the latter often invited him to féterne but only when they had no other guests to dazzle living all the year round at beausoleil m de chevregny had remained more provincial than they and so when he went for a few weeks to paris there was not a moment to waste if he was to ‘see everything’ in the time so much so that occasionally a little dazed by the number of spectacles too rapidly digested when he was asked if he had seen a particular play he would find that he was no longer sure but this uncertainty was rare for he had that detailed knowledge of paris only to be found in people who seldom go there he advised me which of the ‘novelties’ i ought to see “it’s worth your while” regarding them however solely from the point of view of the pleasant evening that they might help to spend and so completely ignoring the aesthetic point of view as never to suspect that they might indeed constitute a ‘novelty’ occasionally in the history of art so it was that speaking of everything in the same tone he told us “we went once to the opéracomique but the show there is nothing much it’s called pelléas et mélisande it’s rubbish périer always acts well but it’s better to see him in something else at the gymnase on the other hand they’re doing la châtelaine we went again to it twice don’t miss it whatever you do it’s well worth seeing besides it’s played to perfection you have frévalles marie magnier baron fils” and he went on to quote the names of actors of whom i had never heard and without prefixing monsieur madame or mademoiselle like the duc de guermantes who used to speak in the same ceremoniously contemptuous tone of the ‘songs of mademoiselle yvette guilbert’ and the ‘experiments of monsieur charcot’ this was not m de chevregny’s way he said “cornaglia and dehelly” as he might have said “voltaire and montesquieu” for in him with regard to actors as to everything that was parisian the aristocrat’s desire to shew his scorn was overcome by the desire to appear on familiar terms of the provincial

   immediately after the first dinnerparty that i had attended at la raspelière with what was still called at féterne ‘the young couple’ albeit m and mme de cambremer were no longer by any means in their first youth the old marquise had written me one of those letters which one can pick out by their handwriting from among a thousand she said to me “bring your delicious — charming — nice cousin it will be a delight a pleasure” always avoiding and with such unerring dexterity the sequence that the recipient of her letter would naturally have expected that i finally changed my mind as to the nature of these diminuendoes decided that they were deliberate and found in them the same corruption of taste — transposed into the social key — that drove saintebeuve to upset all the normal relations between words to alter any expression that was at all conventional two methods taught probably by different masters came into conflict in this epistolary style the second making mme de cambremer redeem the monotony of her multiple adjectives by employing them in a descending scale by avoiding an ending upon the perfect chord on the other hand i was inclined to see in these inverse gradations not an additional refinement as when they were the handiwork of the dowager marquise but an additional clumsiness whenever they were employed by the marquis her son or by his lady cousins for throughout the family to quite a remote degree of kinship and in admiring imitation of aunt zélia the rule of the three adjectives was held in great honour as was a certain enthusiastic way of catching your breath when you were talking an imitation that had passed into the blood moreover and whenever in the family circle a little girl while still in the nursery stopped short while she was talking to swallow her saliva her parents would say “she takes after aunt zélia” would feel that as she grew up her upper lip would soon tend to hide itself beneath a faint moustache and would make up their minds to cultivate her inherited talent for music it was not long before the cambremers were on less friendly terms with mme verdurin than with myself for different reasons they felt they must invite her to dine the ‘young’ marquise said to me contemptuously “i don’t see why we shouldn’t invite that woman in the country one meets anybody it needn’t involve one in anything” but being at heart considerably impressed they never ceased to consult me as to the way in which they should carry out their desire to be polite i thought that as they had invited albertine and myself to dine with some friends of saintloup smart people of the neighbourhood who owned the château of gourville and represented a little more than the cream of norman society for which mme verdurin while pretending never to look at it thirsted i advised the cambremers to invite the mistress to meet them but the lord and lady of féterne in their fear so timorous were they of offending their noble friends or so simple were they that m and mme verdurin might be bored by people who were not intellectual or yet again since they were impregnated with a spirit of routine which experience had not fertilised of mixing different kinds of people and making a social blunder declared that it would not be a success and that it would be much better to keep mme verdurin whom they would invite with all her little group for another evening for this coming evening — the smart one to meet saintloup’s friends — they invited nobody from the little nucleus but morel in order that m de charlus might indirectly be informed of the brilliant people whom they had in their house and also that the musician might help them to entertain their guests for he was to be asked to bring his violin they threw in cottard as well because m de cambremer declared that he had ‘a go’ about him and would be a success at the dinnertable besides it might turn out useful to be on friendly terms with a doctor if they should ever have anybody ill in the house but they invited him by himself so as not to ‘start any complications with the wife’ mme verdurin was furious when she heard that two members of the little group had been invited without herself to dine at féterne ‘quite quietly’ she dictated to the doctor whose first impulse had been to accept a stiff reply in which he said “we are dining that evening with mme verdurin” a plural which was to teach the cambremers a lesson and to shew them that he was not detachable from mme cottard as for morel mme verdurin had no need to outline a course of impolite behaviour for him he found one of his own accord for the following reason if he preserved with regard to m de charlus in so far as his pleasures were concerned an independence which distressed the baron we have seen that the latter’s influence was making itself felt more and more in other regions and that he had for instance enlarged the young virtuoso’s knowledge of music and purified his style but it was still at this point in our story at least only an influence at the same time there was one subject upon which anything that m de charlus might say was blindly accepted and put into practice by morel blindly and foolishly for not only were m de charlus’s instructions false but even had they been justifiable in the case of a great gentleman when applied literally by morel they became grotesque the subject as to which morel was becoming so credulous and obeyed his master with such docility was that of social distinction the violinist who before making m de charlus’s acquaintance had had no conception of society had taken literally the brief and arrogant sketch of it that the baron had outlined for him “there are a certain number of outstanding families” m de charlus had told him “first and foremost the guermantes who claim fourteen alliances with the house of france which is flattering to the house of france if anything for it was to aldonce de guermantes and not to louis the fat his consanguineous but younger brother that the throne of france should have passed under louiv xiv we ‘draped’ at the death of monsieur having the same grandmother as the king a long way below the guermantes one may however mention the families of la trémoïlle descended from the kings of naples and the counts of poitiers of d’uzès scarcely old as a family but the premier peers of luynes who are of entirely recent origin but have distinguished themselves by good marriages of choiseul harcourt la rochefoucauld add to these the family of the noailles notwithstanding the comte de toulouse montesquieu and castellane and i think i am right in saying those are all as for all the little people who call themselves marquis de cambremerde or de vatefairefiche there is no difference between them and the humblest private in your regiment it doesn’t matter whether you go and p —at comtesse s— t’s or s — t at baronne p—‘s it’s exactly the same you will have compromised yourself and have used a dirty rag instead of toilet paper which is not nice” morel had piously taken in this history lesson which was perhaps a trifle cursory and looked upon these matters as though he were himself a guermantes and hoped that he might some day have an opportunity of meeting the false la tour d’auvergnes in order to let them see by the contemptuous way in which he shook hands that he did not take them very seriously as for the cambremers here was his very chance to prove to them that they were no better than ‘the humblest private in his regiment’ he did not answer their invitation and on the evening of the dinner declined at the last moment by telegram as pleased with himself as if he had behaved like a prince of blood it must be added here that it is impossible to imagine how intolerable and interfering m de charlus could be in a more general fashion and even he who was so clever how stupid on all occasions when the flaws in his character came into play we may say indeed that these flaws are like an intermittent malady of the mind who has not observed the fact among women and even among men endowed with remarkable intelligence but afflicted with nerves when they are happy calm satisfied with their surroundings we cannot help admiring their precious gifts the words that fall from their lips are the literal truth a touch of headache the slightest injury to their selfesteem is enough to alter everything the luminous intelligence become abrupt convulsive and narrow reflects nothing but an irritated suspicious teasing self doing everything that it can to give trouble the cambremers were extremely angry and in the interval other incidents brought about a certain tension in their relations with the little clan as we were returning the cottards charlus brichot morel and i from a dinner at la raspelière one evening after the cambremers who had been to luncheon with friends at harambouville had accompanied us for part of our outward journey “you who are so fond of balzac and can find examples of him in the society of today” i had remarked to m de charlus “you must feel that those cambremers come straight out of the scènes de la vie de province” but m de charlus for all the world as though he had been their friend and i had offended him by my remark at once cut me short “you say that because the wife is superior to the husband” he informed me in a dry tone “oh i wasn’t suggesting that she was the muse du département or mme de bargeton although    ” m de charlus again interrupted me “say rather mme de mortsauf” the train stopped and brichot got out “didn’t you see us making signs to you you are incorrigible” “what do you mean” “why have you never noticed that brichot is madly in love with mme de cambremer” i could see from the attitude of cottard and charlie that there was not a shadow of doubt about this in the little nucleus i felt that it shewed a trace of malice on their part “what you never noticed how distressed he became when you mentioned her” went on m de charlus who liked to shew that he had experience of women and used to speak of the sentiment which they inspire with a natural air and as though this were the sentiment which he himself habitually felt but a certain equivocally paternal tone in addressing all young men — notwithstanding his exclusive affection for morel — gave the lie to the views of a womanloving man which he expressed “oh these children” he said in a shrill mincing singsong voice “one has to teach them everything they are as innocent as a newborn babe they can’t even tell when a man is in love with a woman i wasn’t such a chicken at your age” he added for he liked to use the expressions of the underworld perhaps because they appealed to him perhaps so as not to appear by avoiding them to admit that he consorted with people whose current vocabulary they were a few days later i was obliged to yield to the force of evidence and admit that brichot was enamoured of the marquise unfortunately he accepted several invitations to luncheon with her mme verdurin decided that it was time to put a stop to these proceedings quite apart from the importance of such an intervention to her policy in controlling the little nucleus explanations of this sort and the dramas to which they gave rise caused her an ever increasing delight which idleness breeds just as much in the middle classes as in the aristocracy it was a day of great emotion at la raspelière when mme verdurin was seen to disappear for a whole hour with brichot whom it was known she proceeded to inform that mme de cambremer was laughing at him that he was the joke of her drawingroom that he would end his days in disgrace having forfeited his position in the teaching world she went so far as to refer in touching terms to the laundress with whom he was living in paris and to their little girl she won the day brichot ceased to go to féterne but his grief was such that for two days it was thought that he would lose his sight altogether while in any case his malady increased at a bound and held the ground it had won in the meantime the cambremers who were furious with morel invited m de charlus on one occasion deliberately without him receiving no reply from the baron they began to fear that they had committed a blunder and deciding that malice made an evil counsellor wrote a little late in the day to morel an ineptitude which made m de charlus smile as it proved to him the extent of his power “you shall answer for us both that i accept” he said to morel when the evening of the dinner came the party assembled in the great drawingroom of féterne in reality the cambremers were giving this dinner for those fine flowers of fashion m and mme féré but they were so much afraid of displeasing m de charlus that although she had got to know the férés through m de chevregny mme de cambremer went into a fever when on the afternoon before the dinner she saw him arrive to pay a call on them at féterne she made every imaginable excuse for sending him back to beausoleil as quickly as possible not so quickly however that he did not pass in the courtyard the férés who were as shocked to see him dismissed like this as he himself was ashamed but whatever happened the cambremers wished to spare m de charlus the sight of m de chevregny whom they judged to be provincial because of certain little points which are overlooked in the family circle and become important only in the presence of strangers who are the last people in the world to notice them but we do not like to display to them relatives who have remained at the stage which we ourselves have struggled to outgrow as for m and mme féré they were in the highest sense of the words what are called ‘really nice people’ in the eyes of those who so defined them no doubt the guermantes the rohans and many others were also really nice people but their name made it unnecessary to say so as everybody was not aware of the exalted birth of mme féré‘s mother and the extraordinarily exelusive circle in which she and her husband moved when you mentioned their name you invariably added by way of explanation that they were ‘the very best sort’ did their obscure name prompt them to a sort of haughty reserve however that may be the fact remains that the férés refused to know people on whom a la trémoïlle would have called it needed the position of queen of her particular stretch of coast which the old marquise de cambremer held in the manche to make the férés consent to come to one of her afternoons every year the cambremers had invited them to dinner and were counting largely on the effect that would be made on them by m de charlus it was discreetly announced that he was to be one of the party as it happened mme féré had never met him mme de cambremer on learning this felt a keen satisfaction and the smile of the chemist who is about to bring into contact for the first time two particularly important bodies hovered over her face the door opened and mme de cambremer almost fainted when she saw morel enter the room alone like a private secretary charged with apologies for his minister like a morganatic wife vho expresses the prince’s regret that he is unwell so mme de clinchamp used to apologise for the duc d’aumale morel said in the airiest of tones “the baron can’t come he is not feeling very well at least i think that is why i haven’t seen him this week” he added these last words completing the despair of mme de cambremer who had told m and mme féré that morel saw m de charlus at every hour of the day the cambremers pretended that the baron’s absence gave an additional attraction to their party and without letting morel hear them said to their other guests “we can do very well without him can’t we it will be all the better” but they were furious suspected a plot hatched by mme verdurin and tit for tat when she invited them again to la raspelière m de cambremer unable to resist the pleasure of seeing his house again and of mingling with the little group came but came alone saying that the marquise was so sorry but her doctor had ordered her to stay in her room the cambremers hoped by this partial attendance at once to teach m de charlus a lesson and to shew the verdurins that they were not obliged to treat them with more than a limited politeness as princesses of the blood used in the old days to ‘shew out’ duchesses but only to the middle of the second saloon after a few weeks they were scarcely on speaking terms m de cambremer explained this to me as follows “i must tell you that with m de charlus it was rather difficult he is an extreme dreyfusard    ” “oh no” “yes    anyhow his cousin the prince de guermantes is they’ve come in for a lot of abuse over that i have some relatives who are very particular about that sort of thing i can’t afford to mix with those people i should quarrel with the whole of my family” “since the prince de guermantes is a dreyfusard that will make it all the easier” said mme de cambremer “for saintloup who is said to be going to marry his niece is one too indeed that is perhaps why he is marrying her” “come now my dear you mustn’t say that saintloup who is a great friend of ours is a dreyfusard one ought not to make such allegations lightly” said m de cambremer “you would make him highly popular in the army” “he was once but he isn’t any longer” i explained to m de cambremer “as for his marrying mlle de guermantesbrassac is there any truth in that” “people are talking of nothing else but you should be in a position to know” “but i repeat that he told me himself he was a dreyfusard” said mme de cambremer “not that there isn’t every excuse for him the guermantes are half german” “the guermantes in the rue de varenne you can say are entirely german” said cancan “but saintloup is a different matter altogether he may have any amount of german blood his father insisted upon maintaining his title as a great nobleman of france he rejoined the service in 1871 and was killed in the war in the most gallant fashion i may take rather a strong line about these matters but it doesn’t do to exaggerate either one way or the other in medio    virtus ah i forget the exact words it’s a remark doctor cottard made now there’s a man who can always say the appropriate thing you ought to have a small larousse in the house” to avoid having to give an opinion as to the latin quotation and to get away from the subject of saintloup as to whom her husband seemed to think that she was wanting in tact mme de cambremer fell back upon the mistress whose quarrel with them was even more in need of an explanation “we were delighted to let la raspelière to mme verdurin” said the marquise “the only trouble is she appears to imagine that with the house and everything else that she has managed to tack on to it the use of the meadow the old hangings all sorts of things which weren’t in the lease at all she should also be entitled to make friends with us the two things are entirely distinct our mistake lay in our not having done everything quite simply through a lawyer or an agency at féterne it doesn’t matter but i can just imagine the face my aunt de ch’nouville would make if she saw old mother verdurin come marching in on one of my days with her hair streaming as for m de charlus of course he knows some quite nice people but he knows some very nasty people too” i asked for details driven into a corner mme de cambremer finally admitted “people say that it was he who maintained a certain monsieur moreau morille morue i don’t remember nothing to do of course with morel the violinist” she added blushing “when i realised that mme verdurin imagined that because she was our tenant in the manche she would have the right to come and call upon me in paris i saw that it was time to cut the cable”

   notwithstanding this quarrel with the mistress the cambremers were on quite good terms with the faithful and would readily get into our carriage when they were travelling by the train just before we reached douville albertine taking out her mirror for the last time would sometimes feel obliged to change her gloves or to take off her hat for a moment and with the tortoiseshell comb which i had given her and which she wore in her hair would smooth the plaits pull out the puffs and if necessary over the undulations which descended in regular valleys to the nape of her neck push up her chignon once we were in the carriages which had come to meet us we no longer had any idea where we were the roads were not lighted we could tell by the louder sound of the wheels that we were passing through a village we thought we had arrived we found ourselves once more in the open country we heard bells in the distance we forgot that we were in evening dress and had almost fallen asleep when at the end of this wide borderland of darkness which what with the distance we had travelled and the incidents characteristic of all railway journeys seemed to have carried us on to a late hour of the night and almost half way back to paris suddenly after the crunching of the carriage wheels over a finer gravel had revealed to us that we had turned into the park there burst forth reintroducing us into a social existence the dazzling lights of the drawingroom then of the diningroom where we were suddenly taken aback by hearing eight o’clock strike that hour which we supposed to have so long since passed while the endless dishes and vintage wines followed one another round men in black and women with bare arms at a dinnerparty ablaze with light like any real dinnerparty surrounded only and thereby changing its character by the double veil sombre and strange that was woven for it with a sacrifice of their first solemnity to this social purpose by the nocturnal rural seaside hours of the journey there and back the latter indeed obliged us to leave the radiant and soon forgotten splendour of the lighted drawingroom for the carriages in which i arranged to sit beside albertine so that my mistress might not be left with other people in my absence and often for another reason as well which was that we could both do many things in a dark carriage in which the jolts of the downward drive would moreover give us an excuse should a sudden ray of light fall upon us for clinging to one another when m de cambremer was still on visiting terms with the verdurins he would ask me “you don’t think that this fog will bring on your choking fits my sister was terribly bad this morning ah you have been having them too” he said with satisfaction “i shall tell her that tonight i know that as soon as i get home the first thing she will ask will be whether you have had any lately” he spoke to me of my sufferings only to lead up to his sister’s and made me describe mine in detail simply that he might point out the difference between them and hers but notwithstanding these differences as he felt that his sister’s choking fits entitled him to speak with authority he could not believe that what ‘succeeded’ with hers was not indicated as a cure for mine and it irritated him that i would not try these remedies for if there is one thing more difficult than submitting oneself to a regime it is refraining from imposing it upon other people “not that i need speak a mere outsider when you are here before the areopagus at the fountainhead of wisdom what does professor cottard think about them” i saw his wife once again as a matter of fact because she had said that my ‘cousin’ had odd habits and i wished to know what she meant by that she denied having said it but finally admitted that she had been speaking of a person whom she thought she had seen with my cousin she did not know the person’s name and said faintly that if she was not mistaken it was the wife of a banker who was called lina linette lisette lia anyhow something like that i felt that ‘wife of a banker’ was inserted merely to put me off the scent i decided to ask albertine whether this were true but i preferred to speak to her with an air of knowledge rather than of curiosity besides albertine would not have answered me at all or would have answered me only with a ‘no’ of which the ‘n’ would have been too hesitating and the ‘o’ too emphatic albertine never related facts that were capable of injuring her but always other facts which could be explained only by them the truth being rather a current which flows from what people say to us and which we apprehend invisible as it may be than the actual thing that they say and so when i assured her that a woman whom she had known at vichy had a bad reputation she swore to me that this woman was not at all what i supposed and had never attempted to make her do anything improper but she added another day when i was speaking of my curiosity as to people of that sort that the vichy lady had a friend whom she albertine did not know but whom the lady had ‘promised to introduce to her’ that she should have promised her this could only mean that albertine wished it or that the lady had known that by offering the introduction she would be giving her pleasure but if i had pointed this out to albertine i should have appeared to be depending for my information upon her i should have put an end to it at once i should never have learned anything more i should have ceased to make myself feared besides we were at balbec the vichy lady and her friend lived at menton the remoteness the impossibility of the danger made short work of my suspicions often when m de cambremer hailed me from the station i had been with albertine making the most of the darkness and with all the more difficulty as she had been inclined to resist fearing that it was not dark enough “you know i’m sure cottard saw us anyhow if he didn’t he must have noticed how breathless we were from our voices just when they were talking about your other kind of breathlessness” albertine said to me when we arrived at the douville station where we were to take the little train home but this homeward like the outward journey if by giving me a certain poetical feeling it awakened in me the desire to travel to lead a new life and so made me decide to abandon any intention of marrying albertine and even to break off our relations finally also and by the very fact of their contradictory nature made this bleach more easy for on the homeward journey just as much as on the other at every station there joined us in the train or greeted us from the platform people whom we knew the furtive pleasures of the imagination were outweighed by those other continual pleasures of sociability which are so soothing so soporific already before the stations themselves their names which had suggested so many fancies to me since the day on which i first heard them the evening on which i travelled down to balbec with my grandmother had grown human had lost their strangeness since the evening when brichot at albertine’s request had given us a more complete account of their etymology i had been charmed by the ‘flower’ that ended certain names such as fiquefleur ronfleur fiers barfleur harfleur etc and amused by the‘beef that comes at the end of bricqueboeuf but the flower vanished and also the beef when brichot and this he had told me on the first day in the train informed us that fleur means a harbour like fiord and thatboeuf in norman budh means a hut as he cited a number of examples what had appeared to me a particular instance became general bricqueboeuf took its place by the side of elbeuf and indeed in a name that was at first sight as individual as the place itself like the name pennedepie in which the obscurities most impossible for the mind to elucidate seemed to me to have been amalgamated from time immemorial in a word as coarse savoury and hard as a certain norman cheese i was disappointed to find the gallic pen which means mountain and is as recognisable in pennemarck as in the apennines as at each halt of the train i felt that we should have friendly hands to shake if not visitors to receive in our carriage i said to albertine “hurry up and ask brichot about the names you want to know you mentioned to me marcouville l’orgueilleuse” “yes i love that orgueil it’s a proud village” said albertine “you would find it” brichot replied “prouder still if instead of turning it into french or even adopting a low latinity as we find in the cartulary of the bishop of bayeux marcouvilla superba you were to take the older form more akin to the norman marculplinvilla superba the village the domain of merculph in almost all these names which end in ville you might see still marshalled upon this coast the phantoms of the rude norman invaders at hermenonville you had standing by the carriage door only our excellent doctor who obviously has nothing of the nordic chief about him but by shutting your eyes ypu might have seen the illustrious hérimund herimundivilla although i can never understand why people choose those roads between loigny and balbecplage rather than the very picturesque roads that lead from loigny to old balbec mme verdurin has perhaps taken you out that way in her carriage if so you have seen incarville or the village of wiscar and tourville before you come to mme verdurin’s is the village of turold and besides there were not only the normans it seems that the germans alemanni came as far as here aumenancourt alemanicurtis — don’t let us speak of it to that young officer i see there he would be capable of refusing to visit his cousins there any more there were also saxons as is proved by the springs of sissonne” the goal of one of mme verdurin’s favourite excursions and quite rightly “just as in england you have middlesex wessex and what is inexplicable it seems that the goths miserable wretches as they are said to have been came as far as this and even the moors for mortagne comes from mauretania their trace has remained at gourville — gothorunvilla some vestige of the latins subsists also lagny latiniacum” “what i should like to have is an explanation of thorpehomme” said m de charlus “i understand homme” he added at which the sculptor and cottard exchanged significant glances “but thorpe” “homme does not in the least mean what you are naturally led to suppose baron” replied brichot glancing maliciously at cottard and the sculptor “homme has nothing to do in this instance with the sex to which i am not indebted for my motherhomme is holm which means a small island etc    as for thorpe or village we find that in a hundred words with which i have already bored our young friend thus in thorpehomme there is not the name of a norman chief but words of the norman language you see how the whole of this country has been germanised” “i think that is an exaggeration” said m de charlus “yesterday i was at orgeville” “this time i give you back the man i took from you in thorpehomme baron without wishing to be pedantic a charter of robert i gives us for orgeville otgervilla the domain of otger all these names are those of ancient lords octeville la venelle is a corruption of l’avenel the avenels were a family of repute in the middle ages bourguenolles where mme verdurin took us the other day used to be written bourg de môles for that village belonged in the eleventh century to baudoin de môles as also did la chaisebaudoin but here we are at doncières” “heavens look at all these subalterns trying to get in” said m de charlus with feigned alarm “i am thinking of you for it doesn’t affect me i am getting out here” “you hear doctor” said brichot “the baron is afraid of officers passing over his body and yet they have every right to appear here in their strength for doncières is precisely the same as saintcyr dominus cyriacus there are plenty of names of towns in which sanctus and sancta are replaced by dominus and domina besides this peaceful military town has sometimes a false air of saintcyr of versailles and even of fontainebleau”

   during these homeward as on the outward journeys i used to tell albertine to put on her things for i knew very well that at aumenancourt doncières epreville saintvast we should be receiving brief visits from friends nor did i at all object to these when they took the form of at hermenonville — the domain of herimund a visit from m de chevregny seizing the opportunity when he had come down to meet other guests of asking me to come over to luncheon next day at beausoleil or at doncières the sudden irruption of one of saintloup’s charming friends sent by him if he himself was not free to convey to me an invitation from captain de borodino from the officers’ mess at the cocqhardi or the serjeants’ at the faisan doré if saintloup often came in person during the whole of the time that he was stationed there i contrived without attracting attention to keep albertine a prisoner under my own watch and ward not that my vigilance was of any use on one occasion however my watch was interrupted when there was a long stop bloch after greeting us was making off at once to join his father who having just succeeded to his uncle’s fortune and having leased a country house by the name of la commanderie thought it befitting a country gentleman always to go about in a post chaise with postilions in livery bloch begged me to accompany him to the carriage “but make haste for these quadrupeds are impatient come o man beloved of the gods thou wilt give pleasure to my father” but i could not bear to leave albertine in the train with saintloup they might while my back was turned get into conversation go into another compartment smile at one another touch one another my eyes glued to albertine could not detach themselves from her so long as saintloup was there now i could see quite well that bloch who had asked me as a favour to go and say how d’ye do to his father in the first place thought it not very polite of me to refuse when there was nothing to prevent me from doing so the porters having told us that the train would remain for at least a quarter of an hour in the station and almost all the passengers without whom it would not start having alighted and what was more had not the least doubt that it was because quite decidedly — my conduct on this occasion furnished him with a definite proof of it — i was a snob for he was well aware of the names of the people in whose company i was in fact m de charlus had said to me some time before this and without remembering or caring that the introduction had been made long ago “but you must introduce your friend to me you are shewing a want of respect for myself” and had talked to bloch who had seemed to please him immensely so much so that he had gratified him with an “i hope to meet you again” “then it is irrevocable you won’t walk a hundred yards to say how d’ye do to my father who would be so pleased” bloch said to me i was sorry to appear to be wanting in good fellowship and even more so for the reason for which bloch supposed that i was wanting and to feel that he imagined that i was not the same towards my middle class friends when i was with people of ‘birth’ from that day he ceased to shew me the same friendly spirit and what pained me more had no longer the same regard for my character but in order to undeceive him as to the motive which made me remain in the carriage i should have had to tell him something — to wit that i was jealous of albertine — which would have distressed me even more than letting him suppose that i was stupidly worldly so it is that in theory we find that we ought always to explain ourselves frankly to avoid misunderstandings but very often life arranges these in such a way that in order to dispel them in the rare circumstances in which it might be possible to do so we must reveal either — which was not the case here — something that would annoy our friend even more than the injustice that he imputes to us or a secret the disclosure of which — and this was my predicament — appears to us even worse than the misunderstanding besides even without my explaining to bloch since i could not my reason for not going with him if i had begged him not to be angry with me i should only have increased his anger by shewing him that i had observed it there was nothing to be done but to bow before the decree of fate which had willed that albertine’s presence should prevent me from accompanying him and that he should suppose that it was on the contrary the presence of people of distinction the only effect of which had they been a hundred times more distinguished would have been to make me devote my attention exclusively to bloch and reserve all my civility for him it is sufficient that accidentally absurdly an incident in this case the juxtaposition of albertine and saintloup be interposed between two destinies whose lines have been converging towards one another for them to deviate stretch farther and farther apart and never converge again and there are friendships more precious than bloch’s for myself which have been destroyed without the involuntary author of the offence having any opportunity to explain to the offended party what would no doubt have healed the injury to his selfesteem and called back his fugitive affection

   friendships more precious than bloch’s is not for that matter saying very much he had all the faults that most annoyed me it so happened that my affection for albertine made them altogether intolerable thus in that brief moment in which i was talking to him while keeping my eye on robert bloch told me that he had been to luncheon with mme bontemps and that everybody had spoken about me with the warmest praise until the ‘decline of helios’ “good” thought i “as mme bontemps regards bloch as a genius the enthusiastic support that he must have given me will do more than anything that the others can have said it will come round to albertine any day now she is bound to learn and i am surprised that her aunt has not repeated it to her already that i am a ‘superior person’” “yes” bloch went on “everybody sang your praises i alone preserved a silence as profound as though i had absorbed in place of the repast poor as it happened that was set before us poppies dear to the blessed brother of thanatos and lethe the divine hypnos who enwraps in pleasant bonds the body and the tongue it is not that i admire you less than the band of hungry dogs with whom i had been bidden to feed but i admire you because i understand you and they admire you without understanding you to tell the truth i admire you too much to speak of you thus in public it would have seemed to me a profanation to praise aloud what i carry in the profoundest depths of my heart in vain might they question me about you a sacred pudor daughter of kronion made me remain mute” i had not the bad taste to appear annoyed but this pudor seemed to me akin — far more than to kronion — to the modesty that prevents a critic who admires you from speaking of you because the secret temple in which you sit enthroned would be invaded by the mob of ignorant readers and journalists — to the modesty of the statesman who does not recommend you for a decoration because you would be lost in a crowd of people who are not your equals to the modesty of the academician who refrains from voting for you in order to spare you the shame of being the colleague of x——who is devoid of talent to the modesty in short more respectable and at the same time more criminal of the sons who implore us not to write about their dead father who abounded in merit so that we shall not prolong his life and create a halo of glory round the poor deceased who would prefer that his name should be borne upon the lips of men to the wreaths albeit laid there by pious hands upon his tomb

   if bloch while he distressed me by his inability to understand the reason that prevented me from going to speak to his father had exasperated me by confessing that he had depreciated me at mme bontemps’s i now understood why albertine had never made any allusion to this luncheonparty and remained silent when i spoke to her of bloch’s affection for myself the young israelite had produced upon m de charlus an impression that was quite the opposite of annoyance

   certainly bloch now believed not only that i was unable to remain for a second out of the company of smart people but that jealous of the advances that they might make to him m de charlus for instance i was trying to put a spoke in his wheel and to prevent him from making friends with them but for his part the baron regretted that he had not seen more of my friend as was his habit he took care not to betray this feeling he began by asking me various questions about bloch but in so casual a tone with an interest that seemed so assumed that one would have thought he did not hear the answers with an air of detachment an intonation that expressed not merely indifference but complete distraction and as though simply out of politeness to myself “he looks intelligent he said he wrote has he any talent” i told m de charlus that it had been very kind of him to say that he hoped to see bloch again the baron made not the slightest sign of having heard my remark and as i repeated it four times without eliciting a reply i began to wonder whether i had not been the dupe of an acoustic mirage when i thought i heard m de charlus utter those words “he lives at balbec” intoned the baron with an air so far from questioning that it is a nuisance that the written language does not possess a sign other than the mark of interrogation with which to end these speeches which are apparently so little interrogative it is true that such a sign would scarcely serve for m de charlus “no they have taken a place near here la commanderie” having learned what he wished to know m de charlus pretended to feel a contempt for bloch “how appalling” he exclaimed his voice resuming all its clarion strength “all the places or properties called la commanderie were built or owned by the knights of the order of malta of whom i am one as the places called temple or cavalerie were by the templars that i should live at la commanderie would be the most natural thing in the world but a jew however i am not surprised it comes from a curious instinct for sacrilege peculiar to that race as soon as a jew has enough money to buy a place in the country he always chooses one that is called priory abbey minster chantry i had some business once with a jewish official guess where he lived at pontl’evêque when he came to grief he had himself transferred to brittany to pontl’abbé when they perform in holy week those indecent spectacles that are called ‘the passion’ half the audience are jews exulting in the thought that they are going to hang christ a second time on the cross at least in effigy at one of the lamoureux concerts i had a wealthy jewish banker sitting next to me they played the boyhood of christ by berlioz he was quite shocked but he soon recovered his habitually blissful expression when he heard the good friday music so your friend lives at the commanderie the wretch what sadism you shall shew me the way to it” he went on resuming his air of indifference “so that i may go there one day and see how our former domains endure such a profanation it is unfortunate for he has good manners he seems to have been well brought up the next thing i shall hear will be that his address in paris is rue du temple” m de charlus gave the impression by these words that he was seeking merely to find a fresh example in support of his theory as a matter of fact he was aiming at two birds with one stone his principal object being to find out bloch’s address “you are quite right” put in brichot “the rue du temple used to be called rue de la chevaleriedutemple and in that connexion will you allow me to make a remark baron” said the don “what what is it” said m de charlus tartly the proffered remark preventing him from obtaining his information “no it’s nothing” replied brichot in alarm “it is with regard to the etymology of balbec about which they were asking me the rue du temple was formerly known as the rue barredubac because the abbey of bac in normandy had its bar of justice there in paris” m de charlus made no reply and looked as if he had not heard which was one of his favourite forms of insolence “where does your friend live in paris as three streets out of four take their name from a church or an abbey there seems every chance of further sacrilege there one can’t prevent jews from living in the boulevard de la madeleine faubourg sainthonoré or place saintaugustin so long as they do not carry their perfidy a stage farther and pitch their tents in the place du parvis notredame quai de l’archevêché rue chanoinesse or rue de l’avemaria we must make allowance for their difficulties” we could not enlighten m de charlus not being aware of bloch’s address at the time but i knew that his father’s office was in the rue des blancsmanteaux “oh is not that the last word in perversity” exclaimed m de charlus who appeared to find a profound satisfaction in his own cry of ironical indignation “rue des blancsmanteaux” he repeated dwelling with emphasis upon each syllable and laughing as he spoke “what sacrilege imagine that these white mantles polluted by m bloch were those of the mendicant brethren styled serfs of the blessed virgin whom saint louis established there and the street has always housed some religious order the profanation is all the more diabolical since within a stone’s throw of the rue des blancsmanteaux there is a street whose name escapes me which is entirely conceded to the jews there are hebrew characters over the shops bakeries for unleavened bread kosher butcheries it is positively the judengasse of paris that is where m bloch ought to reside of course” he went on in an emphatic arrogant tone suited to the discussion of aesthetic matters and giving by an unconscious strain of heredity the air of an old musketeer of louis xiii to his backwardtilted face “i take an interest in all that sort of thing only from the point of view of art politics are not in my line and i cannot condemn wholesale because bloch belongs to it a nation that numbers spinoza among its illustrious sons and i admire rembrandt too much not to realise the beauty that can be derived from frequenting the synagogue but after all a ghetto is all the finer the more homogeneous and complete it is you may be sure moreover so far are business instincts and avarice mingled in that race with sadism that the proximity of the hebraic street of which i was telling you the convenience of having close at hand the fleshpots of israel will have made your friend choose the rue des blancsmanteaux how curious it all is it was there by the way that there lived a strange jew who used to boil the host after which i think they boiled him which is stranger still since it seems to suggest that the body of a jew can be equivalent to the body of our lord perhaps it might be possible to arrange with your friend to take us to see the church of the white mantles just think that it was there that they laid the body of louis d’orléans after his assassination by jean sans peur which unfortunately did not rid us of the orléans personally i have always been on the best of terms with my cousin the duc de chartres still after all they are a race of usurpers who caused the assassination of louis xvi and dethroned charles x and henri v one can see where they get that from when their ancestors include monsieur who was so styled doubtless because he was the most astounding old woman and the regent and the rest of them what a family” this speech antijew or prohebrew — according as one regards the outward meaning of its phrases or the intentions that they concealed — had been comically interrupted for me by a remark which morel whispered to me to the fury of m de charlus morel who had not failed to notice the impression that bloch had made murmured his thanks in my ear for having ‘given him the push’ adding cynically “he wanted to stay it’s all jealousy he would like to take my place just like a yid” “we might have taken advantage of this halt which still continues to ask your friend for some explanations of his ritual couldn’t you fetch him back” m de charlus asked me with the anxiety of uncertainty “no it’s impossible he has gone away in a carriage and besides he is vexed with me” “thank you thank you” morel breathed “your excuse is preposterous one can always overtake a carriage there is nothing to prevent your taking a motorcar” replied m de charlus in the tone of a man accustomed to see everyone yield before him but observing my silence “what is this more or less imaginary carriage” he said to me insolently and with a last ray of hope “it is an open post chaise which must by this time have reached la commanderie” before the impossible m de charlus resigned himself and made a show of jocularity “i can understand their recoiling from the idea of a new brougham it might have swept them clean” at last we were warned that the train was about to start and saintloup left us but this was the only day when by getting into our carriage he unconsciously caused me pain when i thought for a moment of leaving him with albertine in order to go with bloch the other times his presence did not torment me for of her own accord albertine to save me from any uneasiness would upon some pretext or other place herself in such a position that she could not even unintentionally brush against robert almost too far away to have to hold out her hand to him and turning her eyes away from him would plunge as soon as he appeared into ostentatious and almost affected conversation with any of the other passengers continuing this makebelieve until saintloup had gone so that the visits which he paid us at doncières causing me no pain no inconvenience even were in no way discordant from the rest all of which i found pleasing because they brought me so to speak the homage and invitation of this land already as the summer drew to a close on our journey from balbec to douville when i saw in the distance the wateringplace at saintpierre des ifs where for a moment in the evening the crest of the cliffs glittered rosy pink as the snow upon a mountain glows at sunset it no longer recalled to my mind i do not say the melancholy which the sight of its strange sudden elevation had aroused in me on the first evening when it filled me with such a longing to take the train back to paris instead of going on to balbec but the spectacle that in the morning elstir had told me might be enjoyed from there at the hour before sunrise when all the colours of the rainbow are refracted from the rocks and when he had so often wakened the little boy who had served him one year as model to paint him nude upon the sands the name saintpierre des ifs announced to me merely that there would presently appear a strange intelligent painted man of fifty with whom i should be able to talk about chateaubriand and balzac and now in the mists of evening behind that cliff of incarville which had filled my mind with so many dreams in the past what i saw as though its old sandstone wall had become transparent was the comfortable house of an uncle of m de cambremer in which i knew that i should always find a warm welcome if i did not wish to dine at la raspelière or to return to balbec so that it was not merely the placenames of this district that had lost their initial mystery but the places themselves the names already halfstripped of a mystery which etymology had replaced by reason had now come down a stage farther still on our homeward journeys at hermenonville at incarville at harambouville as the train came to a standstill we could make out shadowy forms which we did not at first identify and which brichot who could see nothing at all might perhaps have mistaken in the darkness for the phantoms of herimund wiscar and herimbald but they came up to our carriage it was merely m de cambremer now completely out of touch with the verdurins who had come to see off his own guests and as ambassador for his wife and mother came to ask me whether i would not let him ‘carry me off’ to keep me for a few days at féterne where i should find successively a lady of great musical talent who would sing me the whole of gluck and a famous chessplayer with whom i could have some splendid games which would not interfere with the fishing expeditions and yachting trips on the bay nor even with the verdurin dinnerparties for which the marquis gave me his word of honour that he would ‘lend’ me sending me there and fetching me back again for my greater convenience and also to make sure of my returning “but i cannot believe that it is good for you to go so high up i know my sister could never stand it she would come back in a fine state she is not at all well just now indeed you have been as bad as that tomorrow you won’t be able to stand up” and he shook with laughter not from malevolence but for the same reason which made him laugh whenever he saw a lame man hobbling along the street or had to talk to a deaf person “and before this what you haven’t had an attack for a fortnight do you know that is simply marvellous really you ought to come and stay at féterne you could talk about your attacks to my sister” at incarville it was the marquis de montpeyroux who not having been able to go to féterne for he had been away shooting had come ‘to meet the train’ in top boots with a pheasant’s feather in his hat to shake hands with the departing guests and at the same time with myself bidding me expect on the day of the week that would be most convenient to me a visit from his son whom he thanked me for inviting adding that he would be very glad if i would make the boy read a little or else m de crécy come out to digest his dinner he explained smoking his pipe accepting a cigar or indeed more than one and saying to me “well you haven’t named a day for our next lucullus evening we have nothing to discuss allow me to remind you that we left unsettled the question of the two families of montgomery we really must settle it i am relying upon you” others had come simply to buy newspapers and many others came and chatted with us who i have often suspected were to be found upon the platform of the station nearest to their little mansion simply because they had nothing better to do than to converse for a moment with people of their acquaintance a scene of social existence like any other in fact these halts on the little railway the train itself appeared conscious of the part that had devolved upon it had contracted a sort of human kindliness patient of a docile nature it waited as long as they pleased for the stragglers and even after it had started would stop to pick up those who signalled to it they would then run after it panting in which they resembled itself but differed from it in that they were running to overtake it at full speed whereas it employed only a wise slowness and so hermenonville harambouville incarville no longer suggested to me even the rugged grandeurs of the norman conquest not content with having entirely rid themselves of the unaccountable melancholy in which i had seen them steeped long ago in the moist evening air doncières to me even after i had come to know it and had awakened from my dream how much had long survived in that name of pleasantly glacial streets lighted windows succulent flesh of birds doncières now it was nothing more than the station at which morel joined the train egleville aquilae villa that at which we generally found waiting for us princess sherbatoff maineville the station at which albertine left the train on fine evenings when if she was not too tired she felt inclined to enjoy a moment more of my company having if she took a footpath little if any farther to walk than if she had alighted at parville paterni villa not only did i no longer feel the anxious dread of isolation which had gripped my heart the first evening i had no longer any need to fear its reawakening nor to feel myself a stranger or alone in this land productive not only of chestnut trees and tamarisks but of friendships which from beginning to end of the journey formed a long chain interrupted like that of the blue hills hidden here and there in the anfractuosity of the rock or behind the lime trees of the avenue but delegating at each stage an amiable gentleman who came to interrupt my course with a cordial handclasp to prevent me from feeling it too long to offer if need be to continue the journey with me another would be at the next station so that the whistle of the little tram parted us from one friend only to enable us to meet others between the most isolated properties and the railway which skirted them almost at the pace of a person who is walking fast the distance was so slight that at the moment when from the platform outside the waitingroom their owners hailed us we might almost have imagined that they were doing so from their own doorstep from their bedroom window as though the little departmental line had been merely a street in a country town and the isolated mansionhouse the town residence of a family and even at the few stations where no ‘good evening’ sounded the silence had a nourishing and calming fulness because i knew that it was formed from the slumber of friends who had gone to bed early in the neighbouring manor where my arrival would have been greeted with joy if i had been obliged to arouse them to ask for some hospitable office not to mention that a sense of familiarity so fills up our time that we have not after a few months a free moment in a town where on our first arrival the day offered us the absolute disposal of all its twelve hours if one of these had by any chance fallen vacant it would no longer have occurred to me to devote it to visiting some church for the sake of which i had come to balbec in the past nor even to compare a scene painted by elstir with the sketch that i had seen of it in his studio but rather to go and play one more game of chess at m féré‘s it was indeed the degrading influence as it was also the charm that this country round balbec had had that it should become for me in the true sense a friendly country if its territorial distribution its sowing along the whole extent of the coast with different forms of cultivation gave of necessity to the visits which i paid to these different friends the form of a journey they also reduced that journey to nothing more than the social amusement of a series of visits the same placenames so disturbing to me in the past that the mere country house year book when i turned over the chapter devoted to the department of the manche caused me as keen an emotion as the railway timetable had become so familiar to me that in the timetable itself i could have consulted the page headed balbec to douville via doncières with the same happy tranquillity as a directory of addresses in this too social valley along the sides of which i felt assembled whether visible or not a numerous company of friends the poetical cry of the evening was no longer that of the owl or frog but the ‘how goes it’ of m de criquetot or the ‘chaire’ of brichot its atmosphere no longer aroused my anguish and charged with effluvia that were purely human was easily breathable indeed unduly soothing the benefit that i did at least derive from it was that of looking at things only from a practical point of view the idea of marrying albertine appeared to me to be madnessembed"
