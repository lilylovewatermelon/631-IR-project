with a corncob pipe and a button nose
and eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made of snow but the children know
that he came to life one day
there must have been some magic
in that old silk hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
oh frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me
thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
look at frosty go thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
so he said lets run and well have some fun
now before i melt away
down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
runnin here and there all around the square
sayin catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
he only paused a moment
when he heard him holler stop
because ol frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye sayin dont you cry
ill be back again some day ill be back again some day
ill be back again some dayyou might also likeembed"
