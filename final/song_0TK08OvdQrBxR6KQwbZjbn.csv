youll face trials on the road for miles and miles
but dont look back on this worndown barn and twolane town
just keep rollin
rollin southbound

now im up here on this stage in shinin lights
its just you and me and a sixstring here tonight
life will come and pass you by
unless you chase it down
so ill keep rollin
rollin southbound

papa wore the tread off his old boots
and it would end it to get us through
he sent me on my way
and im here to make him proud
so ill keep rollin
rollin southbound

mm
whoa

i can promise you wont think i aint changin
ill always be that boy from pennsylvania
ill thank the lord above for every face out in this crowd
and for their own he keeps me rollin southbound
so ill keep rollin
