everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
cause you feel like home youre like a dream come true
but if by chance youre here alone
can i have a moment before i go
cause ive been by myself all night long
hoping youre someone i used to know

prechorus
you look like a movie you sound like a song
my god this reminds me of when we were young

chorus
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie it was just like a song

verse 2
i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that youd be here
and i swear youd moved overseas
thats what you said when you left me

you still look like a movie you still sound like a song
my god this reminds me of when we were young

chorus
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie it was just like a song

postchorus
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young

bridge
its hard to admit that when we were young
everything just takes me back when we were young
to when you were there when we were young
to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on when we were young
just in case it hasnt gone when we were young
i guess i still care when we were young
do you still care
break
it was just like a movie it was just like a song
my god this reminds me of when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young

chorus
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
when we were young when we were young
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
when we were young when we were young
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
when we were young when we were young
oh im so mad im getting old it makes me reckless
when we were young when we were young
it was just like a movie it was just like a song
when we were young94embed"
