with everything ahead of us
we left everything behind
but nothing that we needed
at least not at this time

and now the feeling that im feeling
well its feeling like my life is finally mine
with nothing to go back to we just continue to drive

chorus
without you i was broken
and id rather be broke down with you by my side
so without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my side
verse 2
i didnt know what i was looking for
so i didnt know what id find
i didnt know what i was missing
i guess youve been just a little too kind

and if i find just what i need
ill put a little peace in my mind
maybe youve been looking too
or maybe you dont even need to try

without you i was broken
and id rather be broke down with you by my side
so without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my side

verse 3
with everything in the past
fading faster and faster until it was gone
found out i was losing so much more than i knew all along
because everything ive been working for
was only worth nickels and dimes

bridge
but if i had a minute for every hour that ive wasted
id be rich in time id be doing fine
chorus
cause without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my side
so without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my side
so without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my side
so without you i was broken
but id rather be broke down with you by my sideembed"
