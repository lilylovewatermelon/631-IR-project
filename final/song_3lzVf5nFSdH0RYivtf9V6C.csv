can yall hear me out here
are those speakers on yeah
yeah they are

verse 1
i knew a girl whod wear my tshirts when she went to sleep at night
shed make sure im breathin in the morning
we were locked inside a room i ate a pill shaped like the moon
put her tongue into my mouth like she wanted it
we cant hide this secret anymore
im inside i let you take control
once we met i cannot love someone again
cut my chest gave you my heart and soul

prechorus
wait where ya goin

chorus
close my eyes
she said im comin with you tonight
yeah close my eyes
count to ten and see if i die

verse 2
i knew a girl who saw me cry before cause i was broken
i was in hell burning alive how did you find me here
she wrapped her arms around my body and said dont stop holding
now start the car baby and take me the fuck out of here
rip my shirt i feel your skin on mine
this is yours you can take my life
drip my words onto the paint
your knife did not work no
we couldve died
