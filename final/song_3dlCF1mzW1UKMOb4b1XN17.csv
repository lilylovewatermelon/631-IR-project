it was yesterday it was years ago
we were singin every word on the radio
kinda like them songs could save our souls
somehow someway
we was fallin fast we was jumpin in
bluejean halo hangin off the limb
two american kids just like them
every time they played
and it blew us away

chorus
do you turn it up do you sing along
every time you hear that song
like we did then
like we did when
do you close your eyes does it make you laugh
do the memories take you back
to sixpacks and a chevy cheyenne
way back when i was jack and you were diane

postchorus
yeah and the music played

verse 2
yeah we were never growin up or growin old
breakin up or lettin go
girl just like rock n roll
where has it gone
but i hope like hell every now and again
i blow across your mind like that summer wind
and youre holdin on to sixteen long as you can
every time that it comes on
