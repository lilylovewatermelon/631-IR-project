ive got you deep in the heart of me
so deep in my heart youre really a part of me
ive got you under my skin

ive tried so not to give in
ive said to myself this affair never will go so well
but why should i try to resist when darling i know so well
ive got you under my skin

sacrifice anything having you near
in spite of the warning that repeats

dont you know you never can win
use your mentality wake up to reality
but each time i do just the thought of you
makes me stop before i begin

oh baby under my skin
baby baby you under my skin

dont you know that each time i do
just the thought of you makes me stop before i begin
under my skin

never win never win
never win never win
no no never win never win
never win never win
no no never win never win
never win never win
no no never win never win
never win never winsee the four seasons liveget tickets as low as 50you might also like1embed"
