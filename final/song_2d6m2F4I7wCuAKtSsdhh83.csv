now i know that i cant make you stay
but wheres your heart
but wheres your heart
but wheres your—
and i know theres nothing i can say
to change that part

verse 1
so many bright lights to cast a shadow
but can i speak
well is it hard understanding
im incomplete
a life thats so demanding
i get so weak
a love thats so demanding
i cant speak

chorus
i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone
honey if you stay youll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home

can you see my eyes are shining bright
cause im out here on the other side
of a jet black hotel mirror
and im so weak
is it hard understanding
im incomplete
a love thats so demanding
i get weak

chorus
i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone
honey if you stay youll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home
i am not afraid to keep on living
i am not afraid to walk this world alone
honey if you stay youll be forgiven
nothing you can say can stop me going home
