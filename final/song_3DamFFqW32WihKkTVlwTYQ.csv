you would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
lit up the world as i fell asleep
cause theyd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
youd think me rude but i would just stand and stare

chorus
id like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
its hard to say that id rather stay awake when im asleep
cause everything is never as it seems

verse 2
cause id get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
as they tried to teach me how to dance
a foxtrot above my head a sock hop beneath my bed
a disco ball is just hanging by a thread

chorus
id like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
its hard to say that id rather stay awake when im asleep
cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep

bridge
leave my door open just a crack
please take me away from here
cause i feel like such an insomniac
please take me away from here
why do i tire of counting sheep
please take me away from here
when im far too tired to fall asleep
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likeverse 3
to ten million fireflies im weird cause i hate goodbyes
i got misty eyes as they said farewell they said farewell
but ill know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar jar jar jar

chorus
id like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
its hard to say that id rather stay awake when im asleep
cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
id like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
its hard to say that id rather stay awake when im asleep
cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep

outro
id like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
its hard to say that id rather stay awake when im asleep
because my dreams are bursting at the seams95embed"
