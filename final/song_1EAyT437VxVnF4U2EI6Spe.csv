life could slip away in absent minded numbness
i’m only sayin this ‘cause i wish for the best
when you always stay in selfincarceration
i think it’s such a shame

chorus
don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home oh
if he don’t have to he don’t want to
don’t stay home this time no don’t say no

verse 2
oh how i’d like to diffuse your time bomb anger
it’s screaming danger danger
this kind of world don’t care if you’re home
so you better get some

chorus
don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home oh
if he don’t have to he don’t want to
don’t stay home this time no don’t say no

verse 3
everything i’m sayin’ you can dismiss
because i sat alone on this past christmas
i deserved to be alone but
i guess i should have gone home
see 311 liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likebridge
hey don’t break the mold kid just eat around it yeah that’s what i did
i’ll be running around the block for no apparent reason
somethin’ you’ll catch me doin’ in any given season
gotta break a sweat man gotta go bust out
biddybybybyby goodbye to the drought uh

chorus
don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home oh
if he don’t have to he don’t want to
don’t stay home this time no don’t say no

outro
don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home
if he don’t have to he don’t want to
don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home3embed"
