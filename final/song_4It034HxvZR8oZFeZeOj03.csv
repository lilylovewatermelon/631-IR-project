whiskeys got me seeing sideways
blame the devil for all my mistakes
lord help me wash these sins away

cause i am lost
yeah i am lost
and i aint been found

always standing too close to the fire
never could say no to my desire
i keep rolling on my four flat tires

cause i am lost
yeah i am lost
and i aint been found uh huh uh huh

mamma was an angel
poppa was a saint
look what became of the prayers they prayed uh huh uh huh
