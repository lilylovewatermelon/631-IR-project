they wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
they love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
on the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
thats how country boys roll
yeah they work work work all week til the job gets done
weekends they barbque and have a cold one
they run on a big ol heart and a pinch of skoal
thats how country boys roll

chorus
yeah theyre spinning their wheels
casting their reels
way back on them all county roads
singing in bars
souping their cars just to see how fast theyll go
from a ball and glove to them falling in love
they do everything heart and soul
thats how country boys roll

verse 2
well if you dont know your way around
theyll draw you a map
and if youre broke and you ask
theyll give you the shirt off their back
all they need is a little gas
a few dollars to fold
thats how country boys roll
