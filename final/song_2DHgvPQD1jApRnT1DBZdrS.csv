can anybody fly this thing
before my head explodes or my head starts to ring

weve been livin life inside a bubble
weve been livin life inside a bubble

chorus
confidence in you is confidence in me
is confidence in a high speed

verse 2
can anybody stop this thing
before my head explodes or my head starts to ring

weve been living life inside a bubble
weve been livin life inside a bubble

chorus
confidence in you is confidence in me
is confidence in a high speed
