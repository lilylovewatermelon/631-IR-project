what i hate most in this life is a long night
four walls and no calls and no lights
but the moonlight creepin through the blinds
ceiling fan on high spinnin
im beginning to believe that tonight is the night
dead by dawn
ill shred my palms to the end of my arm
im spread and gone embalmed
put me in the dirt where i belong
existence is overrated anyway
fifty years later they wont remember youre dead
six billion people living as civilians and i hated them all
i should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp
at least id have scales to protect me from the pain

verse 2 lick loth
enter the void with my wrist shackled up
codeine and water that fill up my cup
visuals glisten when i get fucked up
rehabs for quitters and i dont give up
cockin the nine if you wanna act tough
this all by design i dont have any luck
when it comes to them dollars dont make me get buck
hollow tip showers when i go and bust
tell me the reason you wanna be us
ill tell you good riddance and then get the fuck
used to fuck bitches in back of the bus
nothin has changed bitch im still bustin nuts
always complainin bout bitches and love
when i dont feel nothing no not even lust
triple six demons in satan we trust
killing these motherfuckers is a mustsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like50embed"
