i live off crumpled dollars from an old pickle jar
i live off what im growin in the back of the yard
folgers hot in the mornin
sun shinin on my doublewide
i live off seven hours with a dog in the bed
i live off of them letters written in crimson red
sunday talks with my mama
porch pickin and my chicken fried

chorus
i live off a back road in a small town
story like my daddy before me and his daddy before that
i live off a hard days work penny saved penny earned
just to keep this shirt on my back aw yeah

with tough in his blood and a heart of pure gold
from the very first breath i breathe to my last yall
i aint ever gonna turn the way i live off
