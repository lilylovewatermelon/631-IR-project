when i passed that city limit sign
i knew that i was finally on my own
so i put my foot down on the gas
to see how fast those wheels could get me going
everything about that place made me who i am
but they say once you leave you cant go back again

chorus
so i took it with me that cloud of red dust rolling up
that georgia blue sky setting sun straight up highway 41
i took it with me that wild street that fighting size
that on the run on a friday night
that standing tall small town crowd
i took it with me

verse 2
they say this world can change you fast
kick you right on back where you belong
i rolled my sleeves up every day
thats just what you do where i come from
everything i ever knew i bottled up inside
what id leave your side at back home
it aint hard to find

chorus
so i took it with me that cloud of red dust rolling up
that georgia blue sky setting sun straight up highway 41
i took it with me that wild street that fighting size
that on the run on a friday night
that standing tall small town crowd
i took it with me
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
id be a thousand miles away
but its still crystal clear
i see that picture in my mind
i keep with right here

chorus
so i took it with me that cloud of red dust rolling up
that georgia blue sky setting sun straight up highway 41
i took it with me that wild street that fighting size
that on the run on a friday night
that standing tall small town crowd
i took it with me1embed"
