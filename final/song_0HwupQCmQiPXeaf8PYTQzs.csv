i saw you standing there from across the room
your eyes they locked with mine i wanted to talk to you
i saw you smile at me but i had to look away
i’d sing a song for you if i could find the words to say
i wish that i could find my loving lady
i love you girl but this world is so damn crazy
i’d walk over over mountain tops and sail the ocean too
there ain’t nothing girl nothing i won’t do for you

foundation good vibration
good things come come from inspiration

it’s just one of those days

verse 2
life is an open road everything just stop and go
give me the green light i just feel like
we running out of time but i’m not done chasing
things fall in place when you stop racing
and here i stand alone i’m just kicking stones
i got nowhere to go i’m just breathing
try to see there good things coming
i know there’s love among us
i love the earth and sun and
the moon the stars above us

verse 3
when it’s time to go when it’s all said and done
i’m not the only one who had a lot of fun
when i look around i see my reflection
of me once upon a time a time when i was young
there is this world out there sometimes i just don’t care
love is in the air can you feel it
lets go for a ride lets spread the good vibes
lets all gettogether​ everything will be alright
