all at once
the world can overwhelm me
theres almost nothing that you could tell me
that could ease my mind
which way will you run
when its always all around you
and the feeling lost and found you again
a feeling that we have no control

around the sun
some say
theres going to be the new hell
some say
its still too early to tell
some say
it really is no myth at all
keep asking ourselves are we really
strong enough
theres so many things that we got
too proud of
were too proud of
were too proud of
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likei want to take the preconceived
out from underneath your feet
we could shake it off
instead well plant some seeds
well watch them as they grow
and with each new beat
from your heart the roots grow deeper

the branches will they reach for what
nobody really knows
but underneath it all
theres this heart all alone

chorus
what about when its gone
and it really wont be so long
sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singing from at all

verse 2
theres a world weve never seen
theres still hope between the dreams
the weight of it all
could blow away with a breeze
if youre waiting on the wind
dont forget to breathe
cause as the darkness gets deeper
well be sinking as we reach for love
at least something we could hold
but ill reach to you from where time just cant go
