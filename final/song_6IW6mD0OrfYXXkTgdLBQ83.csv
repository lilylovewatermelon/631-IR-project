id change my name to find a space to get some rest
id give my face to find a place to put my head
but this is who we are theres no glamor to it
i board the plane and sleep my way to lax
i cried at the rain but theres no way that im depressed
oh if i think too hard im scared i might lose it

chorus
oh
the hollywood sign dont catch my eye much anymore
oh oohooh
leave it to time to make me feel im getting old
im living with it
give me the open mind that i had before

postchorus

they sense the blame that comes with failure and success
would it make me famous if i break down in the press
and give them what they want theres no effort to it

im living with it

i miss the days when one was better than the last
i miss the taste of growing pains i knew would pass
oh i miss those thoughts and that fear of losing
chorus
oh
i dont know why i see no light in anything
oh oohooh
leave it to life to turn my strengths back into weaknesses
but im living with em
so give me the open mind that i had before
