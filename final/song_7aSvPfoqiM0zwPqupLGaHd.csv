i got these girls tryna lock me down
and i always up and leave
but for the first time in a while
i wanna throw away the key
and i know youve been in a couple more relationships than me
cause you talk a different talk
and you kiss me differently

prechorus
now i dont know where to go
after you loved me this way
after you loved me so good
how are you gonna tell me you dont wanna stay oh

chorus
you tell me im too young but
i gave you what you wanted
baby how dare you treat me just like
like a boy
you wont wake up beside me
cause i was born in the 90s
baby how dare you treat me just like
like a boy go and treat me like
boy go and treat me like
boy ooh
