oh yeah got you drinking out them white cups sodas
all this shit so foreign to you thick smoke choking
baby get familiar with the order
just crack it then pour it then sip slow then tip low
my eyes red but my brim low that xo
she climbing straight to the top forgetting why she there in the first place
no more crying heart rate slow put that rum down you dont wanna die tonight
i promise when you’re finished we’ll head to where i’m living
the party won’t finish it’s a fucking celebration oh yeah
for my niggas out tonight
and they high off shakespeare lines
theres enough to pass around you dont gotta wait in line
and the clocks dont work you dont gotta check the time
and the blinds dont work you dont gotta check the sky
well be going all night til light

chorus
i got a test for you
you say you want my heart
well baby you can have it all
theres just something that i need from you
is to meet my boys

verse 2
and youve been going hard baby
now you rolling with some big boys baby
got a lot you wanna show off baby
close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
dont mind all my writings on the wall
i thought i passed my peak and im experiencing fall
and all i wanna do is leave cause ive been zoning for a week
and i aint left this little room tryna concentrate to breathe
cause this piff so potent killing serotonin
in that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
on that all black voodoo heavy gum chewing
go on if you thirsty baby if you thirsty
grab a cup of that xo baby i been leaning
back from the come down girl ive been fiending
for another round dont you blame it on me
when youre grinding up your teeth and its fucking hard to sleep

and we can make you right
and if you get too high

verse 3
baby come over here and
ride it out ride it out
work that back til i tire out
roll that weed bring that fire out
taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
bed so wet when i eat you out
girls friends scream that im creeping out
if theyre not down better keep em out
exman hollering keep him out
hard to let go i could teach you how
take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
bet a shot of this cognac ease you out
just one night trying to fucking leave you out
baby baby
chorus
i got a test for you
