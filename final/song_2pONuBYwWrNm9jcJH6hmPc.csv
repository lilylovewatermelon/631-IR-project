verse 1
some say now suffer all the children
and walk away a savior
or a madman and polluted
from gutter institutions
dont you breathe for me
undeserving of your sympathy
cause there aint no way that im sorry for what i did

prechorus
and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i dont feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye

and sleep
just sleep
the hardest part
is letting go of your dreams

verse 2
a drink for the horror that im in
for the good guys and the bad guys
for the monsters that ive been
three cheers for tyranny
unapologetic apathy
cause there aint no way that im coming back again

prechorus
and through it all
how could you cry for me
cause i dont feel bad about it
so shut your eyes
kiss me goodbye

chorus
and sleep
just sleep
the hardest parts
the awful things that ive seen

sometimes i see flames
and sometimes i see the people that i love dying
and its always—
—i see flames
and sometimes i see the people that i love dying
just sleep
and its always—
—i see flames
and sometimes i see the people that i love dying
just sleep
and its always—
