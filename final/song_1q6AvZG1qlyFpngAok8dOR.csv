shes like staring at the sun
she could easily blind someone
other women i see none
shes like staring at the sun

chorus
she gets on to you under your skin like a tattoo
shell always be there
she holds on stuck in your head like an old song
she aint going nowhere

verse 2
shes like standing in the rain
washes all my cares away
at the end of a long hot day
shes like standing in the rain oh

chorus
she gets on to you under your skin like a tattoo
shell always be there
she holds on stuck in your head like an old song
she aint going nowhere

shell always be there
she holds on stuck in your head like an old song
she aint going nowhere

outro
shes like finally coming home
and seeing that light in the window on
after being gone too long
shes like finally coming home standing in the rain
staring at the sun1embed"
