looking out the window waiting for your headlights
to pull up in the driveway its really comin down tonight
youre scared that i wont make it through the storm
you should be here with me safe and warm

chorus the band perry  justin bieber
ill be waiting under the mistletoe
while youre drivin here through the winter snow
baby think of me
if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
home this christmas

verse 2 justin bieber with the band perry
pacing down the hallway tryna fight the urge to call
i could almost hear a pin drop except for the clock on the wall yeah yeah
and im scared that you wont make it through the storm
you should be here with me safe and warm

chorus the band perry  justin bieber
ill be waiting under the mistletoe
while youre driving here through the winter snow
baby think of me
if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
home this christmas

im praying that you make it home tonight
so we can lay down by the fireside
you and i til christmas morning
theres nothing else that i want this year i want this year
more than just to have you here ill be waiting

chorus the band perry  justin bieber
ill be waiting under the mistletoe
while youre driving here through the winter snow
baby think of me
if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
home this christmas
