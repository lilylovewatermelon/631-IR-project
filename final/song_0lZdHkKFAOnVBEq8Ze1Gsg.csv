whats up whats down
ladies and gentleman we are entering into the fifth dimension
and did i mention we gone ha ha ha we gone we gone
bob bob give it to em shortie

verse 1 bob
girl im eons and eons beyond these peons
another human like me there will never be one
the planet that im from i cant even speak on
the stars is what i sleep on
the moon i put my feet on
the way my aura glow youd swear im made of neon
cooler than the freon thats in your dodge neon
they say the future is now to me it hasnt begun
stay tuned to me and their will never be a rerun
so come and leap on my body and as we come
youll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
we gone we out it no we dont need rockets
we hop up on the mother ship an we gone we slidin
we slippin through dimensions we hyper space glidin
blastin through the atmosphere
frightenin in the lightenin
i know im out my mind girl but you know you like it
so hope up on my cosmic highway so can ride it
you might also likechorus ricco barrino
shorty are you going my way
come and ride on my my cosmic highway
ooh lets go
ooh lets go
look shorty i cant stay on the earth no more
another galaxy we must go

verse 2 bob
well fresh up out the sky im like a meteorite
so when the studio no i dont need to go write
man i just came up in the game cause yall just needed more life
so so by the time im done their aint gonna be no more mics
and people ask me bob what kind of language is that
cause i may blast into the future i may never come back
and im a leave with a 30000 light year leap
headed to a distant planet called bob
and then im gone
man they not ignoring me
taking off from half court air jordan
all systems go in 10 seconds im orbiting
hanging in the cosmos like a space ornament
heat em up like a solar panel yes i bring the pain
similar to asteroid thats headed to your brain
my lane is something that they really cannot explain
they try to hold me down but man its me they cant contain
chorus ricco barrino
shorty are you going my way
come and ride on my my cosmic highway
ooh lets go
ooh lets go
look shorty i cant stay on the earth no more
another galaxy we must go

bridge ricco barrino
come and go with me ill take you to my galaxy
im talkin bout venus jupiter mars mars mars
and im sayin girl lets ride all night
and i need you for this ship girl to take flight
lets go lets go
come on baby let me take it off
another second we gone blast it off

chorus ricco barrino
shorty are you going my way
come and ride on my my cosmic highway
ooh lets go
ooh lets go
look shorty i cant stay on the earth no more
another galaxy we must goembed"
