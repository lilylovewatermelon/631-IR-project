took my first breath where the muddy brazos
spills into the gulf of mexico
where the skyline’s colored by chemical plants
t’put bread on the table of the working man
where the working man does his best to provide
safety and shelter for kids and a wife
given little of his soul every day
making over time to keep the wolves away

verse 2
well i was barely thirteen when the company man
tried to dig my dad his grave
it happened on a french owned tanker ship
spillin poison in the galveston bay
where the liquid fire filled his lungs and his eyes
silenced any mortal cries
cold and the grip of death stinging pain
he fought like hell to keep the wolves away

verse 3
for the next few years dad was sick as a dog
but he made a recovery just to spite the odds
the settlement came and we moved out of town
where the sky isn’t heavy with refinery clouds
yeah he’s still alive he’s doing good he’s in his fifties
but the moneys running out n he’s pinching for pennies
so goin’ for broke with every song i’ve made
cause now it’s my turn to keep the wolves awayyou might also like2embed"
