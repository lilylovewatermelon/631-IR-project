well ive been over drinkin
cause ive been overthinkin
cause i get so damn anxious at night
chemicals and nicotine friends ask how you been
and you just learn to say youre alright

chorus
poems and closing time oh sweet love of mine
i found it so hard to find truth
poems and closing time oh sweet love of mine
itll always just be me and you

verse 1
and those bastards get richer
while the poor dig ditches
to bury their dreamin in
and labor dont cheat
baby 5 am is the reason theyre sleepin in
oh men build churches
so the kids find worth in
somethin bigger than themselves
but the uncorruptible dont exist
and you cant buy your way outta hell

closin time
im lost again past two
closin time
itll always just be me and you

prechorus
and ive been over drinkin
cause ive been overthinkin
cause i get so damn anxious at night
chemicals and nicotine friends ask me how ive been
you just learn to say youre alright

chorus
poems and closing time oh sweet love of mine
i found it so hard to find truth
poems and closing time only true friend of mine
itll always just be me and you

outro
so dont try to pain me and dont try play me
as one of your sorry fools
poems and closing time oh sweet love of mine
in a world thats growing so cruelembed"
