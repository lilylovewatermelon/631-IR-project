verse 1 patrick stump
im not a crybaby

a caterpillar that got stuck
mr moth come quick with any luck
a long walk to a dark house
a roman candle heart keep us far apart

they only want the best wishes for me
oh three two one we go live

but youll be faded soon
stuck on a little hot mess little hot mess
whoa whoaoh oh
