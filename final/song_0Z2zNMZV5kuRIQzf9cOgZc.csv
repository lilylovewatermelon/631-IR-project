see myself in the pouring home
see the light come over now
i see myself in the pouring rain
i watch hope come over me

here we are now going to the east side
i pick up my friends and we start to ride
ride all night yeah we ride all day
some may come and some may stay here— here— here—

verse 2
here we are in the pouring home
i watch a light man fold a comb
i watch a line move across the screen
i watch the light come over me here— here— here—

chorus
here we are now going to the west side
weapons in hand as we go for a ride
some may come love and some may stay
watching out for a sunny day

love and darkness and my sidearm

here we are now going to the north side
i look at my friends as they start to ride
ride at night yeah we ride all day
looking out for a sunny day

ride at night ride through heaven and hell
come back and feel so well8embed"
