used to pray for a key ask god to send me a bird
got the drop on my opps im never gon say a word
its time to go berserk ive been dying to go berserk
grey poupon spillin wine on your shirt
went on a stain after i hit it had to go to church
selling cocaine cookin up chickens dont nobody care
and i done spent countless nights workin inside the kitchen
drivin in the car smoke an ounce in sixty minutes
used to pray for a key ask god to send me a bird
got the drop on my opps im never gon say a word
its time to go berserk ive been dying to go berserk
grey poupon spillin wine on your shirt
went on a stain after i hit it had to go to church
selling cocaine cookin up chickens dont nobody care
and i done spent countless nights workin inside the kitchen
drivin in the car smoke an ounce in sixty minutes

verse 1
smoking green loud grape gushers yeah
hangin in the trap where i learned to hustle yeah
