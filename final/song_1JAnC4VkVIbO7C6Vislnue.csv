yo mika
i said suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
i said suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down

suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
i said suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down

say love say love
oh loves gonna get you down
say love say love
oh loves gonna get you down

i went walking with my mamma one day
when she warned me what people say
“live your life until love is found
cuz love’s gonna get you down”

“take a look at the girl next door
she’s a player and a downright bore
jesus love’s her but she wants more
oh bad girls get you down”
sing it

oh loves gonna get you down
suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down

oh loves gonna get you down

mamma told me what i should know
too much candy gonna rot your soul
if she loves you let her go
cuz love only gets you down

now take a look at a boy like me
never stood on my own two feet
now i’m blue as i can be
oh love come get me down
sing it

suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
say love
say love
oh loves gonna get you down
i went walking with my mamma one day
when she warned me what people say
“live your life until love is found
or love’s gonna get you down”
sing it

suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
suckin too hard on your lollipop
oh loves gonna get you down
say love

oh loves gonna get you down

mamma told me what i should know
too much candy gonna rot your soul
if she loves you let her go
cuz love only gets you down11embed"
