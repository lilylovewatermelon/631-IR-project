crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

verse 1 chester bennington
theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming confusing
this lack of selfcontrol i fear is neverending
controlling i cant seem

prechorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
to find myself again my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
im convinced that theres just too much pressure to take
ive felt this way before so insecure

chorus chester bennington
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

verse 2 chester bennington  mike shinoda
discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting distracting reacting reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection my own reflection
its haunting its haunting how i cant seem
