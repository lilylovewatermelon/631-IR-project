so lock and load mercenaries
i see the smoke from the hilltop
they march one by one

verse 1
the battled starts adversaries
we bathe in our blood
the worst is yet to come
weve reached the covenant
to kill what we have started
kill the machines
weve spawned to fight in the darkest hour

prechorus
they really need to know
we really gotta go
we fight to live we fight for pride
they really need to know
we wont back down the weak wont survive
we really gotta go

chorus
we stay here tonight
dont let them find us or were dead
promise me you wont leave my side
the warmest place to lie my head
and when the sun comes up we fight
dont let them find us or were dead
so promise me you wont leave my side

trace the blood back to the grave

verse 2
the smoke has cleared
thousands are destroyed
they send signals no salvation
we fight in lock out
scope is ready to go
armed with explosives
spartans stand alone

prechorus
they really need to know
we really gotta go
we fight to live we fight for pride
they really need to know
we wont back down the weak wont survive
we really gotta go

chorus
we stay here tonight
dont let them find us or were dead
promise me you wont leave my side
the warmest place to lie my head
and when the sun comes up we fight
dont let them find us or were dead
so promise me you wont leave my side
bridge
with my breath

guitar solo

chorus
we stay here tonight
dont let them find us or were dead
promise me you wont leave my side
the warmest place to lie my head
and when the sun comes up we fight
dont let them find us or were dead
so promise me you wont leave my side

verse 3
charge the gates with rust on their gears
they seek destruction and kill the functions
charge the gates with rust on their gears
they seek destruction and kill the functions
charge the gates with rust on their gears
they seek destruction and kill the functions
charge the gates with rust on their gears1embed"
