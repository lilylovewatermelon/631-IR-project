i felt for sure last night that once we said goodbye
no one else will know these lonely dreams
no one else will know that part of me
im still driving away and im sorry every day
i wont always love these selfish things
i wont always live not stopping

verse 2
it was my turn to decide
i knew this was our time
no one else will have me like you do
no one else will have me only you

chorus
youll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
what are you hoping for
im here im now im ready
holding on tight
dont give away the end
the one thing that stays mine

verse 3
amazing still it seems
ill be 23
i wont always love what ill never have
i wont always live in my regrets

dont give away the end
