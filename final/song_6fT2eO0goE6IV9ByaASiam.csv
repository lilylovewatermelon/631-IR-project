the first time ever i saw your face i thought the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
to the dark and the endless sky my love
and the first time ever i kissed your mouth
i felt the earth move through my hands
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
that was there at my command
and the first time ever i lay with you
i felt your heart so close to mine
and i know our joy would fill the earth
and last till the end of time my love
