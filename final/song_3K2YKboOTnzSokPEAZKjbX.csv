and getting there with no directions
and underneath the arch it turned into a march
and there he found the spark to set this fucker off

set it off set it off now children alright
set it off set it off now children set a fire
set it off set it off now children

and he lay in need of some attention
and there he played his card going into shock
the last thing that he said was set this fucker off

and it all adds up inside your head
