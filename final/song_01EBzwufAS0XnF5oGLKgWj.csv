city streets at night
can be so intimidating
im not the toughest guy
i gotta keep my eyes open
you came out of nowhere

chorus
man you really freak me out
im so afraid of you
and when i lose my cool
i dont know what to do
i know you dont mean no harm
youre just doing your thing
but man you really freak me out

verse 2
did i hurt you
are you okay
can i buy you a drink
oh whats the world coming to
you came out of nowhere

chorus
man you really freak me out
im so afraid of you
and when i lose my cool
i dont know what to do
i know you dont mean no harm
youre just doing your thing
but man you really freak me out
