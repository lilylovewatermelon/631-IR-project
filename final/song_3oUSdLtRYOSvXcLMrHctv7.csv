verse 1
loving alone is what you make it
make it make it
stay for the storm if you can take it
take it take it
but pray for a raincoat to bare the brunt of mistakes
i know you worry a lot if i’ll be here for you
do i care enough do i feel for you
i can guarantee

prechorus
count on this one whoa whoa

chorus
and i didn’t know you tried cause you wanted more
and i didn’t know you cried cause you wanted more
things dont happen the way you hoped to
i’m just keeping a little hope baby
and i didn’t know you tried cause you wanted more

dying of daydreams in your bedroom

been waiting so long said you’d be here soon

when hell over earth came i stood for you
will you stand for me

verse
funny how life is turning out
i dont have much to talk about
don’t have much to write about
got a shitload to cry about
funny the words i do kick
funny the niggas i do pick
it’s funny what sticks
go figure
mama said i’m sensitive
i gotta work on that
not really
tired of using adjectives i gotta build on that
you feel me
not really

outro
