i cannot ever find a way
to throw these darkened thoughts away
need a place to hide
its thrown in my face every day
guess thats the price i have to pay
for whats inside my mind
alive

chorus
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive

verse 2
little things tick me every day
contemplate how i like to play
better not cross that line
voices in my head happen to be saved
its something i cant throw away
whats inside my mind

chorus
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive
bridge
i bide my time
im intertwined
im falling in this place
i thought i left behind
i bide my time
im intertwined
im falling in this place
i thought i left behind
i bide my time feeling so alone
im intertwined
im falling in this place
i thought i left behind
i bide my time feeling so alone
im intertwined
im falling in this place
i thought i left behind

i am alive
i will never run away

my heart screams inside with pride

now i wipe away the tears
once i died
