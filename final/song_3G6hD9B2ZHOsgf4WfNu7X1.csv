wait till youre announced
weve not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and shell
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out
send the call out send the call out

verse 1
call all the ladies out
theyre in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in
their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother
while he glows through the room

prechorus
dancin around the lies we tell
dancin around big eyes as well
even the comatose
they dont dance and tell

we live in cities youll never see onscreen
not very pretty but we sure know how to run things
livin in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know were on each others team

postchorus

verse 2
so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasnt my fault
and everyones competing
for a love they wont receive
cause what this palace wants is release

chorus
we live in cities youll never see onscreen
not very pretty but we sure know how to run things
livin in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know were on each others team

postchorus
im kind of over gettin told to throw my hands up in the air
so there
im kind of older than i was when i reveled without a care
so there
