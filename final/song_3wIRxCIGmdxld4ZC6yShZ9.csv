packing while youre asleep
you were the catalyst
i dont know what it is about how you breathe
about how you breathe
i want to be alone
hate it that no one knows youre good to everyone
all them but me
all them but me

prechorus
and if you hear me leaving in the morning
could you just pretend that it was only wind
cause i cant love you even if i want to
got a lot to work through
you dont know where ive been

chorus
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming

verse 2
say something sweet to me
it never meant a thing
used to the turbulence
i wore long sleeves
i wore long sleeves
fought til you tethered me
swept under surfaces
never enough of it
you didnt think
you didnt think
you might also likeprechorus
if you hear me leaving in the morning
could you please pretend that it was only wind
cause i cant love you even if i want to
got a lot to work through
you dont know where ive been

chorus
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming
its been a long time coming

im coming down im coming down im coming down

im coming down im coming down im coming down
coming down im coming down im coming down
im coming down im coming down im coming down
im coming down im coming down im coming down
