verse 1
boy look at you lookin at me
i know you know how i feel
lovin you is hard bein heres harder

i dont wanna do this anymore
its so surreal
i cant survive
if this is all thats real

chorus
all i wanna do is get high by the beach
get high by the beach get high

when you would pay tribute to me cause i know that
all i wanted to do was get high by the beach
get high baby baby byebye

verse 2
boy look at you lookin at me
i know you dont understand
you could be a bad motherfucker

because you got out of hand
