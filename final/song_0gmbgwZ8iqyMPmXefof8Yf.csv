never made it as a wise man
i couldnt cut it as a poor man stealing
tired of livin like a blind man
im sick of sight without a sense of feeling
and this is how you remind me

prechorus
this is how you remind me of what i really am
this is how you remind me of what i really am

chorus
its not like you to say sorry
i was waitin on a different story
this time im mistaken
for handing you a heart worth breakin
and ive been wrong ive been down
been to the bottom of every bottle
these five words in my head
scream are we havin fun yet

postchorus

yet yet yet no no
