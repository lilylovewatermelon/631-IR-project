well it was down some street we couldnt even pronounce
we were smoking a little from a half an ounce
the tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
neither one of us looking for three little words
unless those three words were do not disturb
checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in til three

chorus
she kept the hotel key
slipped it in her purse
i guess it makes her think of me
and that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
we both know we cant open the door no more
she kept the hotel key

verse 2
well i could still see her on the bed sitting indian style
with my tshirt on and a half drunk smile
she talked about austin and how shed get back there someday
we had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
we danced by the tv we never turned on
and wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away
but this isnt one of those stories that ends up that way no

chorus
she kept the hotel key
slipped it in her purse
i guess it makes her think of me
and that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
we both know we cant open the door no more
she kept the hotel key
yeah
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
we left the lights
we left the crowd
we left the world and locked it out
she left a picture in my head
she left the night i cant forget but

chorus
she kept the hotel key
slipped it in her purse
i guess it makes her think of me
and that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
we both know we cant open the door no more
she kept the hotel key
yeah she kept it
she kept the hotel key
slipped it in her purse
i guess it makes her think of me
and that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
we both know we cant open the door no more
she kept the hotel key

outro
yeah she kept it
she kept the hotel key ooh
she kept the hotel key3embed"
