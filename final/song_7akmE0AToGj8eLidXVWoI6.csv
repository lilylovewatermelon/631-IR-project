lord almighty
i feel my temperature rising
higher higher
its burning through to my soul
girl girl girl girl
youre gonna set me on fire
my brain is flaming
i dont know which way to go

chorus
your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love

verse 2
ooh ooh ooh
i feel my temperature rising
help me im flaming
i must be a hundred and nine
burning burning burning
and nothing can cool me
i just might turn into smoke
but i feel fine
you might also likechorus
cause your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
and you light my morning sky
with burning love

verse 3
its coming closer
the flames are now licking my body
wont you help me
i feel like im slipping away
its hard to breathe
and my chest is aheaving
lord have mercy
im burning a hole where i lay

chorus
your kisses lift me higher
like the sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love
with burning love
ah ah burning love

outro
im just a hunk a hunk of burning love
