they say that looks can be deceiving
and theres been rumors going round
one look at mes the same thing as believing
everything youve heard without hearing a sound

chorus
so if my eyes remind you of water in a well
its because your heart is the stone
i know sometimes it can seem like my mind
belongs to a child thats grown
but somewhere between you and me ive lost my way
and ive been trying to get home
trying like hell but its too soon to tell
if our love has all dried up like water in a well

verse 2
lord knows ive tried to move on
and get you out of my mind
you find your way in to all of my songs
every memory i manage to find

chorus
someday if im standing on some big old stage
and youre down in the crowd
trying to tell your friends i used to know him when
but in your heart youll know it aint true somehow
trying like hell but its too soon to tell
if our love has all dried up like water in a well
you might also likeinstrumental solo

outro
i know you see what its doing to me
im up here playing my part in this nobody town3embed"
