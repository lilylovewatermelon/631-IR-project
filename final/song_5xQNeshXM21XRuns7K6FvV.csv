tell me all the things that i dont understand
you wonder why i push away
you opened up a wound
taught me to be a man
now youre just not listening

chorus
i dont want to be like that
a spitting image of a man i once knew
i cant believe i fell for it
i feel so used

verse 2
tell me all the things that i dont want to hear
you think that you felt all my pain
you opened up a wound
you should open up your ears
because youre just not listening

chorus
i dont want to be like that
a spitting image of a man i once knew
i cant believe i fell for it
i feel so used

i dont want to
i dont want to
