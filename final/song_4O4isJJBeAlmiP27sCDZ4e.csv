put away your inhibitions
let the beast in you just get loose
we all young wild and different
we could all get lit from a lil goose
i know youre terrified by what the future lies
but there’s no compromising its my way or the highway
we all just slave the lust heart building breaking trust
she gon get wowed when we come out
like she gon get loud when the weed come out thats instant
give a fuck what your friends think
tell their bougie ass go wait in line
with them lame niggas talking real rap
tell em break your neck go and bust a rhyme

prechorus
blow one down pass it around ayayay
fuck with me now we running wild ayayayay
nobody game we own the town ayay ayay
never come down ill never come down

chorus
lose it
i might lose it
lose it
i might lose it

everybody got guilty pleasures
mine just tend to catch me cases
handcuffs police inspections
lawyers judges allegations
turn on your favorite station
you hear the same old song
i feel like nagasaki dog
im bout to drop the bomb

prechorus
blow one down pass it around ayayay
fuck with me now we’re running wild ayayayay
and nobody game we own the town ayayay
never come down i’ll never come down
blow one down pass it around ayayay
fuck with me now we’re running wild ayayayay
and nobody game we own the town ayay ayay
never come down i’ll never come down

chorus
lose it
i might lose it
i might lose it
i might lose it
lose it
i might lose it
i might lose it
i might lose it
instrumental break

chorus
