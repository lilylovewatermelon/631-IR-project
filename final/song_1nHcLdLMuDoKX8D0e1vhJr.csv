how much reassurance does a man need
why cant i just let a good thing be
is it just me something dont seem right
in my whole life ive never been so close
to anyone anything so girl i know
i gotta let go and give up the fight
you keep talking like everythings gonna be alright

chorus
so why do i feel like youre slipping away
so dark in my heart girl
too many times torn apart girl
i wanna believe what youre trying to say
girl im trying to listen
dont want my suspicions to drive you away
why do i why do i keep messing with a good thing
why do i feel

verse 2
trying to understand explain everything
over analyze us like were some game
trying to find pain where theres only love
its maybe just that ive never been this far
never walked through so many open doors
and when i get more its never enough
you and me babe
i know were right as rain

so why do i feel like youre slipping away
so dark in my heart girl
too many times torn apart girl
i wanna believe what youre trying to say
girl im trying to listen
dont want my suspicions to drive you away
why do i why do i keep messing with a good thing

bridge
why do i feel like that when it feels like this
better than the best its ever been
lost in your body here in the dark
your fingers my skin a match and a spark
i told myself id make a brand new start

chorus
i wanna believe what youre trying to say
girl im trying to listen
dont want my suspicions to drive you away
yeah im trying to listen
dont want my suspicions to drive you away
why do i why do i keep messing with a good thing
why do i feel
why do i feelembed"
