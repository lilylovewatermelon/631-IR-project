i cant sleep tonight
wide awake and so confused
everythings in line but i am bruised
i need a voice to echo
i need a light to take me home
i kinda need a hero
is it you

prechorus
i never see the forest for the trees
i could really use your melody
baby im a little blind
i think its time for you to find me

chorus
can you be my nightingale
sing to me
i know youre there
you could be my sanity
bring me peace
sing me to sleep
say youll be my nightingale

verse 2
somebody speak to me cause im feeling like hell
need you to answer me
im overwhelmed
i need a voice to echo
i need a light to take me home
i need a star to follow
i dont know
