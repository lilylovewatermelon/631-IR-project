i thought of angels choking on their halos
get them drunk on rose water water
see how dirty i can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
and clip their tiny wings clip their tiny wings

prechorus patrick with foxes
anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name it will be held against you
anything you say can and will be held against you
so only say my name

chorus patrick with foxes foxes
if heavens grief brings hells rain
then id trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
i know im bad news
for just one yesterday
i saved it all for you
i want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
still id trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
i know im bad news
for just one yesterday
i saved it all for you
for just one yesterday

letting people down is my thing baby find yourself a new gig
this town aint big enough for two of us
i dont have the right name or the right looks right looks
but i have twice the heart
prechorus patrick with foxes foxes
anything you say can and will be held against you
