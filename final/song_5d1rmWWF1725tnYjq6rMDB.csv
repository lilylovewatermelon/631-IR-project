star sign gemini
brown eyes fair hair in the light
we called time last night
and i cant stop thinkin’ bout her

refrain
and her lips upon mine
so soft feelings i dont know the name of
under the clothes we take off
used to be two hearts in love

prechorus
oh why oh why am i alone
did i did i do something wrong
am i the reason or have you found someone else
so tell me girl

chorus
how can i live without love
how can i be what you want
’cause when the morning comes around
youre still gone and ill say
how can i see through the dark
all i can do is wonder where you are
are you happy in someone elses arms
well thats the way to break my

verse 2
first love never dies
guess i’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
theres just one thing i remember

refrain
her lips upon mine
so soft feelings i don’t know the name of

used to be two hearts in love
