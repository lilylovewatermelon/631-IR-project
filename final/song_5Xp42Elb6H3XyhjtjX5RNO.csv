verse leighanne jade jesy perrie
lets take it back to where we first began
they turned us strangers into closest friends
turn the page and see the wonder
thats here for you and i i
was all so different once upon a time
but now the spark we got wont ever die
oh close your eyes and feel the magic
dont ever let it go

with a sprinkle of attitude
