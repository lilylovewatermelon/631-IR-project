tell me darlin true
to me you are the sea
vast as you can be
the deepest shade of blue

when youre feelin low
to whom else do you go
see id cry if you hurt
id give you my last shirt
because i love you so

now if my sky should fall
would you even call
ive opened up my heart
i never want to part
im givin you the ball

when i look in your eyes
i can feel the butterflies
i will love you when youre blue
but tell me darlin true
what am i to you

if my sky should fall
would you even call
ive opened up my heart
i never wanna part
im givin you the ball

i can feel the butterflies
could you find a love in me
would you carve me in a tree
dont fill my heart with lies
i will love you when youre blue
but tell me darlin true
what am i to youembed"
