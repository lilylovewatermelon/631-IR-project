and it was all a dream tryna get it out the mud

in my feelings tryna figure out if id see 21

verse 2 e40
i love my city but i had to get next to the money and get established stablished
came a long way from selling that goop and dropping off hella packages packages
raised in the trenches palbearing carrying hella caskets caskets
underground rapper underrated with a method to my madness madness
growing up in the ghetto was nothing short of unforgettable uh
horrific scenes helicopters people get flew to the hospital uh
pullin up to my estate state security guard at the gate gate
golf and a manmade lake lake celebrities stay where i stay stay
you can always tell always tell when youre livin lavish yall yall
aint no streetlights aint no streetlights or no sidewalks walks
you can miss me you can miss me with all that sidetalk talk
please forgive me please forgive me if you dont see me in the fall
