verse 1
ive been tryna call
ive been on my own for long enough
maybe you can show me how to love maybe
im goin through withdrawals
you dont even have to do too much
you can turn me on with just a touch baby

i look around and
sin citys cold and empty oh
no ones around to judge me oh
i cant see clearly when youre gone

i said ooh im blinded by the lights
no i cant sleep until i feel your touch
i said ooh im drowning in the night
oh when im like this youre the one i trust
hey hey hey
