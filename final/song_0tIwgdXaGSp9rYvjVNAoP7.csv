still 2 must i hear—shall hoarse 3 fitzgerald bawl
his creaking couplets in a tavern hall
and i not sing lest haply scotch reviews
should dub me scribbler and denounce my muse
prepare for rhyme—ill publish right or wrong
fools are my theme let satire be my song i
oh natures noblest gift—my grey goosequill
slave of my thoughts obedient to my will
torn from thy parent bird to form a pen
that mighty instrument of little men

the pen foredoomed to aid the mental throes
of brains that labour big with verse or prose
though nymphs forsake and critics may deride
the lovers solace and the authors pride
what wits what poets dost thou daily raise
how frequent is thy use how small thy praise
condemned at length to be forgotten quite
with all the pages which twas thine to write
but thou at least mine own especial pen ii
once laid aside but now assumed again

our task complete like hamets 4 shall be free
though spurned by others yet beloved by me
then let us soar today no common theme
no eastern vision no distempered dream 5
inspires—our path though full of thorns is plain
smooth be the verse and easy be the strain
when vice triumphant holds her sovreign sway
obeyd by all who nought beside obey iii
when folly frequent harbinger of crime
bedecks her cap with bells of every clime iv
when knaves and fools combined oer all prevail
and weigh their justice in a golden scale v
een then the boldest start from public sneers
afraid of shame unknown to other fears
more darkly sin by satire kept in awe
and shrink from ridicule though not from law
such is the force of wit i but not belong
to me the arrows of satiric song
the royal vices of our age demand
a keener weapon and a mightier hand vi

still there are follies een for me to chase
and yield at least amusement in the race
laugh when i laugh i seek no other fame
the cry is up and scribblers are my game
speed pegasus—ye strains of great and small
ode epic elegy—have at you all
i too can scrawl and once upon a time
i poured along the town a flood of rhyme
a schoolboy freak unworthy praise or blame
i printed—older children do the same

tis pleasant sure to see ones name in print
a books a book altho theres nothing int
not that a titles sounding charm can save vii
or scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave
this lamb 6 must own since his patrician name
failed to preserve the spurious farce from shame 7
no matter george continues still to write 8
tho now the name is veiled from public sight
moved by the great example i pursue
the selfsame road but make my own review
not seek great jeffreys yet like him will be
selfconstituted judge of poesy
a man must serve his time to every trade
save censure—critics all are ready made
take hackneyed jokes from miller 9 got by rote
with just enough of learning to misquote
a man well skilled to find or forge a fault
a turn for punning—call it attic salt
to jeffrey go be silent and discreet
his pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet

fear not to lietwill seem a sharper hit viii
shrink not from blasphemy twill pass for wit
care not for feeling—pass your proper jest
and stand a critic hated yet caressd
and shall we own such judgment no—as soon
seek roses in december—ice in june
hope constancy in wind or corn in chaff
believe a woman or an epitaph
or any other thing thats false before
you trust in critics who themselves are sore

or yield one single thought to be misled
by jeffreys heart or lambs boeotian head 10
to these young tyrants by themselves misplaced
combined usurpers on the throne of taste
to these when authors bend in humble awe
and hail their voice as truth their word as law
while these are censors twould be sin to spare 11
while such are critics why should i forbear
but yet so near all modern worthies run
tis doubtful whom to seek or whom to shun
nor know we when to spare or where to strike
our bards and censors are so much alike
then should you ask me 12 why i venture oer
the path which pope and gifford 13 trod before
if not yet sickened you can still proceed
go on my rhyme will tell you as you read
but hold exclaims a friend—heres some neglect
this—that—and tother line seem incorrect
what then the selfsame blunder pope has got
and careless dryden—aye but pye has not—

indeed—tis granted faith—but what care i
better to err with pope than shine with pye 14
time was ere yet in these degenerate days 15
ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise
when sense and wit with poesy allied
no fabled graces flourished side by side
from the same fount their inspiration drew
and reared by taste bloomed fairer as they grew
then in this happy isle a popes pure strain
sought the rapt soul to charm nor sought in vain

a polished nations praise aspired to claim
and raised the peoples as the poets fame
like him great dryden poured the tide of song
in stream less smooth indeed yet doubly strong
then congreves scenes could cheer or otways melt 16
for nature then an english audience felt—
but why these names or greater still retrace
when all to feebler bards resign their place
yet to such times our lingering looks are cast
when taste and reason with those times are past

now look around and turn each trifling page
survey the precious works that please the age
this truth at least let satires self allow
no dearth of bards can be complained of now ix
the loaded press beneath her labour groans x
and printers devils shake their weary bones
while southeys epics cram the creaking shelves xi
and littles lyrics shine in hotpressed twelves 17
thus saith the preacher nought beneath the sun
is new 18 yet still from change to change we run

what varied wonders tempt us as they pass
the cowpox tractors galvanism and gas 19
in turns appear to make the vulgar stare
till the swoln bubble bursts—and all is air
nor less new schools of poetry arise
where dull pretenders grapple for the prize
oer taste awhile these pseudobards prevail xii
each country bookclub bows the knee to baal
and hurling lawful genius from the throne
erects a shrine and idol of its own xiii

some leaden calf—but whom it matters not
from soaring southey down to groveling stott 20
behold in various throngs the scribbling crew
for notice eager pass in long review
each spurs his jaded pegasus apace
and rhyme and blank maintain an equal race
sonnets on sonnets crowd and ode on ode
and tales of terror 21 jostle on the road
immeasurable measures move along
for simpering folly loves a varied song

to strange mysterious dulness still the friend
admires the strain she cannot comprehend
thus lays of minstrels 22—may they be the last—
on halfstrung harps whine mournful to the blast
while mountain spirits prate to river sprites
that dames may listen to the sound at nights
and goblin brats of gilpin horners 23 brood
decoy young bordernobles through the wood
and skip at every step lord knows how high
and frighten foolish babes the lord knows why

while highborn ladies in their magic cell
forbidding knights to read who cannot spell
despatch a courier to a wizards grave
and fight with honest men to shield a knave
next view in state proud prancing on his roan
the goldencrested haughty marmion
now forging scrolls now foremost in the fight
not quite a felon yet but half a knight xiv
the gibbet or the field prepared to grace
a mighty mixture of the great and base

and thinkst thou scott by vain conceit perchance
on public taste to foist thy stale romance
though murray with his miller may combine
to yield thy muse just halfacrown per line 24
no when the sons of song descend to trade
their bays are sear their former laurels fade
let such forego the poets sacred name
who rack their brains for lucre not for fame
still for stern mammon may they toil in vain 25
and sadly gaze on gold they cannot gain 180
such be their meed such still the just reward xv
of prostituted muse and hireling bard
for this we spurn apollos venal son
and bid a long good night to marmion 26
these are the themes that claim our plaudits now
these are the bards to whom the muse must bow
while milton dryden pope alike forgot
resign their hallowed bays to walter scott
the time has been when yet the muse was young
when homer swept the lyre and maro sung

an epic scarce ten centuries could claim
while awestruck nations hailed the magic name
the work of each immortal bard appears
the single wonder of a thousand years 27
empires have mouldered from the face of earth
tongues have expired with those who gave them birth
without the glory such a strain can give
as even in ruin bids the language live
not so with us though minor bards content xvi
on one great work a life of labour spent

with eagle pinion soaring to the skies
behold the balladmonger southey rise
to him let camoëns milton tasso yield
whose annual strains like armies take the field
first in the ranks see joan of arc advance
the scourge of england and the boast of france
though burnt by wicked bedford for a witch
behold her statue placed in glorys niche
her fetters burst and just released from prison
a virgin phoenix from her ashes risen

next see tremendous thalaba come on 28
arabias monstrous wild and wondrous son
domdaniels dread destroyer who oerthrew
more mad magicians than the world eer knew
immortal hero all thy foes oercome
for ever reign—the rival of tom thumb 29
since startled metre fled before thy face
well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race
well might triumphant genii bear thee hence
illustrious conqueror of common sense

now last and greatest madoc spreads his sails
cacique in mexico 30 and prince in wales
tells us strange tales as other travellers do
more old than mandevilles and not so true
oh southey southey 31 cease thy varied song
a bard may chaunt too often and too long
as thou art strong in verse in mercy spare
a fourth alas were more than we could bear
but if in spite of all the world can say
thou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way

if still in berkeleyballads most uncivil
thou wilt devote old women to the devil 32
the babe unborn thy dread intent may rue
god help thee southey 33 and thy readers too
next comes the dull disciple of thy school 34
that mild apostate from poetic rule
the simple wordsworth framer of a lay
as soft as evening in his favourite may
who warns his friend to shake off toil and trouble
and quit his books for fear of growing double 35

who both by precept and example shows
that prose is verse and verse is merely prose
convincing all by demonstration plain
poetic souls delight in prose insane
and christmas stories tortured into rhyme
contain the essence of the true sublime
thus when he tells the tale of betty foy
the idiot mother of an idiot boy
a moonstruck silly lad who lost his way
and like his bard confounded night with day 36

so close on each pathetic part he dwells
and each adventure so sublimely tells
that all who view the idiot in his glory
conceive the bard the hero of the story
shall gentle coleridge pass unnoticed here 37
to turgid ode and tumid stanza dear
though themes of innocence amuse him best
yet still obscuritys a welcome guest
if inspiration should her aid refuse
to him who takes a pixy for a muse 38

yet none in lofty numbers can surpass
the bard who soars to elegize an ass
so well the subject suits his noble mind xvii
he brays the laureate of the longeared kind xviii
oh wonderworking lewis 39 monk or bard
who fain would make parnassus a churchyard xix
lo wreaths of yew not laurel bind thy brow
thy muse a sprite apollos sexton thou
whether on ancient tombs thou takst thy stand
by gibbring spectres hailed thy kindred band

or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page
to please the females of our modest age
all hail mp 40 from whose infernal brain
thinsheeted phantoms glide a grisly train
at whose command grim women throng in crowds
and kings of fire of water and of clouds
with small grey men—wild yagers and what not
to crown with honour thee and walter scott
again all hail if tales like thine may please
st luke alone can vanquish the disease

even satans self with thee might dread to dwell
and in thy skull discern a deeper hell
who in soft guise surrounded by a choir
of virgins melting not to vestas fire
with sparkling eyes and cheek by passion flushed
strikes his wild lyre whilst listening dames are hushed
tis little young catullus of his day
as sweet but as immoral in his lay
grieved to condemn the muse must still be just
nor spare melodious advocates of lust

pure is the flame which oer her altar burns
from grosser incense with disgust she turns
yet kind to youth this expiation oer
she bids thee mend thy line and sin no more xx
for thee translator of the tinsel song
to whom such glittering ornaments belong
hibernian strangford with thine eyes of blue 41
and boasted locks of red or auburn hue
whose plaintive strain each lovesick miss admires
and oer harmonious fustian half expires xxi

learn if thou canst to yield thine authors sense
nor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence
thinkst thou to gain thy verse a higher place
by dressing camoëns 42 in a suit of lace
mend strangford mend thy morals and thy taste
be warm but pure be amorous but be chaste
cease to deceive thy pilfered harp restore
nor teach the lusian bard to copy moore
behold—ye tarts—one moment spare the text xxii—
hayleys last work and worst—until his next

whether he spin poor couplets into plays
or damn the dead with purgatorial praise 43
his style in youth or age is still the same
for ever feeble and for ever tame
triumphant first see tempers triumphs shine
at least im sure they triumphed over mine
of musics triumphs all who read may swear
that luckless music never triumphd there 44
moravians rise bestow some meet reward 45
on dull devotion—lo the sabbath bard

sepulchral grahame 46 pours his notes sublime
in mangled prose nor een aspires to rhyme
breaks into blank the gospel of st luke xxiii
and boldly pilfers from the pentateuch
and undisturbed by conscientious qualms
perverts the prophets and purloins the psalms
hail sympathy thy soft idea brings xxiv
a thousand visions of a thousand things
and shows still whimpering thro threescore of years xxv
the maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers 330
and art thou not their prince harmonious bowles 47
thou first great oracle of tender souls
whether them singst with equal ease and grief xxvi
the fall of empires or a yellow leaf
whether thy muse most lamentably tells
what merry sounds proceed from oxford bells xxvii
or still in bells delighting finds a friend
in every chime that jingled from ostend
ah how much juster were thy muses hap
if to thy bells thou wouldst but add a cap xxviii

delightful bowles still blessing and still blest
all love thy strain but children like it best
tis thine with gentle littles moral song
to soothe the mania of the amorous throng
with thee our nursery damsels shed their tears
ere miss as yet completes her infant years
but in her teens thy whining powers are vain
she quits poor bowles for littles purer strain
now to soft themes thou scornest to confine xxix
the lofty numbers of a harp like thine

awake a louder and a loftier strain 48
such as none heard before or will again
where all discoveries jumbled from the flood
since first the leaky ark reposed in mud
by more or less are sung in every book
from captain noah down to captain cook
nor this alone—but pausing on the road
the bard sighs forth a gentle episode xxx 49
and gravely tells—attend each beauteous miss—
when first madeira trembled to a kiss 360
bowles in thy memory let this precept dwell
stick to thy sonnets man—at least they sell
but if some newborn whim or larger bribe
prompt thy crude brain and claim thee for a scribe
if chance some bard though once by dunces feared
now prone in dust can only be revered
if pope whose fame and genius from the first xxxi
have foiled the best of critics needs the worst
do thou essay each fault each failing scan
the first of poets was alas but man

rake from each ancient dunghill evry pearl
consult lord fanny and confide in curll 50
let all the scandals of a former age
perch on thy pen and flutter oer thy page
affect a candour which thou canst not feel
clothe envy in a garb of honest zeal
write as if st johns soul could still inspire
and do from hate what mallet 51 did for hire
oh hadst thou lived in that congenial time
to rave with dennis and with ralph to rhyme 52

thronged with the rest around his living head
not raised thy hoof against the lion dead
a meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains
and linked thee to the dunciad for thy pains 53
another epic who inflicts again
more books of blank upon the sons of men
boeotian cottle rich bristowas boast
imports old stories from the cambrian coast
and sends his goods to market—all alive
lines forty thousand cantos twentyfive

fresh fish from hippocrene 54 wholl buy wholl buy
the precious bargains cheap—in faith not i
your turtlefeeders verse must needs be flat xxxii
though bristol bloat him with the verdant fat
if commerce fills the purse she clogs the brain
and amos cottle strikes the lyre in vain
in him an authors luckless lot behold
condemned to make the books which once he sold
oh amos cottle—phoebus what a name
to fill the speakingtrump of future fame—

oh amos cottle for a moment think
what meagre profits spring from pen and ink
when thus devoted to poetic dreams
who will peruse thy prostituted reams
oh pen perverted paper misapplied
had cottle 55 still adorned the counters side
bent oer the desk or born to useful toils
been taught to make the paper which he soils
ploughed delved or plied the oar with lusty limb
he had not sung of wales nor i of him

as sisyphus against the infernal steep
rolls the huge rock whose motions neer may sleep
so up thy hill ambrosial richmond heaves
dull maurice 56 all his granite weight of leaves
smooth solid monuments of mental pain
the petrifactions of a plodding brain
that ere they reach the top fall lumbering back again
with broken lyre and cheek serenely pale
lo sad alcæus wanders down the vale
though fair they rose and might have bloomed at last

his hopes have perished by the northern blast
nipped in the bud by caledonian gales
his blossoms wither as the blast prevails
oer his lost works let classic sheffield weep
may no rude hand disturb their early sleep 57
yet say why should the bard at once resign xxxiii
his claim to favour from the sacred nine
for ever startled by the mingled howl
of northern wolves that still in darkness prowl
a coward brood which mangle as they prey

by hellish instinct all that cross their way
aged or young the living or the dead xxxiv
no mercy findthese harpies must be fed
why do the injured unresisting yield
the calm possession of their native field
why tamely thus before their fangs retreat
nor hunt the bloodhounds back to arthurs seat 58
health to immortal jeffrey once in name
england could boast a judge almost the same 59
in soul so like so merciful yet just
some think that satan has resigned his trust
and given the spirit to the world again
to sentence letters as he sentenced men
with hand less mighty but with heart as black
with voice as willing to decree the rack
bred in the courts betimes though all that law
as yet hath taught him is to find a flaw—
since well instructed in the patriot school
to rail at party though a party tool—
who knows if chance his patrons should restore

back to the sway they forfeited before
his scribbling toils some recompense may meet
and raise this daniel to the judgmentseat 60
let jeffreys shade indulge the pious hope
and greeting thus present him with a rope
heir to my virtues man of equal mind
skilled to condemn as to traduce mankind
this cord receive for thee reserved with care
to wield in judgment and at length to wear
health to great jeffrey heaven preserve his life

to flourish on the fertile shores of fife
and guard it sacred in its future wars
since authors sometimes seek the field of mars
can none remember that eventful day xxxv 61
that everglorious almost fatal fray
when littles leadless pistol met his eye 62
and bowstreet myrmidons stood laughing by
oh day disastrous on her firmset rock
dunedins castle felt a secret shock
dark rolled the sympathetic waves of forth

low groaned the startled whirlwinds of the north
tweed ruffled half his waves to form a tear
the other half pursued his calm career 63
arthurs steep summit nodded to its base
the surly tolbooth scarcely kept her place
the tolbooth felt—for marble sometimes can
on such occasions feel as much as man—
the tolbooth felt defrauded of his charms
if jeffrey died except within her arms 64

nay last not least on that portentous morn
the sixteenth story where himself was born
his patrimonial garret fell to ground
and pale edina shuddered at the sound
strewed were the streets around with milkwhite reams
flowed all the canongate with inky streams
this of his candour seemed the sable dew
that of his valour showed the bloodless hue
and all with justice deemed the two combined
the mingled emblems of his mighty mind
but caledonias goddess hovered oer

the field and saved him from the wrath of moore
from either pistol snatched the vengeful lead
and straight restored it to her favourites head
that head with greater than magnetic power
caught it as danäe caught the golden shower
and though the thickening dross will scarce refine
augments its ore and is itself a mine
my son she cried neer thirst for gore again
resign the pistol and resume the pen
oer politics and poesy preside

boast of thy country and britannias guide
for long as albions heedless sons submit
or scottish taste decides on english wit
so long shall last thine unmolested reign
nor any dare to take thy name in vain
behold a chosen band shall aid thy plan
and own thee chieftain of the critic clan
first in the oatfed phalanx 65 shall be seen
the travelled thane athenian aberdeen 66
herbert shall wield thors hammer 67 and sometimes

in gratitude thoult praise his rugged rhymes
smug sydney 68 too thy bitter page shall seek
and classic hallam 69 much renowned for greek
scott may perchance his name and influence lend
and paltry pillans 70 shall traduce his friend
while gay thalias luckless votary lamb xxxvi 71
damned like the devil—devillike will damn
known be thy name unbounded be thy sway
thy hollands banquets shall each toil repay
while grateful britain yields the praise she owes

to hollands hirelings and to learnings foes
yet mark one caution ere thy next review
spread its light wings of saffron and of blue
beware lest blundering brougham 72 destroy the sale
turn beef to bannocks cauliflowers to kail
thus having said the kilted goddess kist
her son and vanished in a scottish mist 73
then prosper jeffrey pertest of the train 74
whom scotland pampers with her fiery grain
whatever blessing waits a genuine scot 530
in double portion swells thy glorious lot
for thee edina culls her evening sweets
and showers their odours on thy candid sheets
whose hue and fragrance to thy work adhere—
this scents its pages and that gilds its rear 75
lo blushing itch coy nymph enamoured grown
forsakes the rest and cleaves to thee alone
and too unjust to other pictish men
enjoys thy person and inspires thy pen
illustrious holland hard would be his lot

his hirelings mentioned and himself forgot 76
holland with henry petty 77 at his back
the whipperin and huntsman of the pack
blest be the banquets spread at holland house
where scotchmen feed and critics may carouse
long long beneath that hospitable roof xxxvii
shall grubstreet dine while duns are kept aloof
see honest hallam 78 lay aside his fork
resume his pen review his lordships work
and grateful for the dainties on his plate xxxviii

declare his landlord can at least translate 79
dunedin view thy children with delight
they write for food—and feed because they write xxxix
and lest when heated with the unusual grape
some glowing thoughts should to the press escape
and tinge with red the female readers cheek
my lady skims the cream of each critique
breathes oer the page her purity of soul
reforms each error and refines the whole 80
now to the drama turn—oh motley sight

what precious scenes the wondering eyes invite
puns and a prince within a barrel pent xl 81
and dibdins nonsense yield complete content 82
though now thank heaven the rosciomanias oer 83
and fullgrown actors are endured once more
yet what avail their vain attempts to please
while british critics suffer scenes like these
while reynolds vents his dammes poohs and
zounds xli 84

and commonplace and common sense confounds
while kenneys 85 world—ah where is kenneys wit xlii— 570
tires the sad gallery lulls the listless pit
and beaumonts pilfered caratach affords
a tragedy complete in all but words xliii
who but must mourn while these are all the rage
the degradation of our vaunted stage
heavens is all sense of shame and talent gone
have we no living bard of merit—none
awake george colman 86 cumberland awake87
ring the alarum bell let folly quake
oh sheridan if aught can move thy pen

let comedy assume her throne again xliv
abjure the mummery of german schools
leave new pizarros to translating fools 88
give as thy last memorial to the age
one classic drama and reform the stage
gods oer those boards shall folly rear her head
where garrick trod and siddons lives to tread xlv 89
on those shall farce display buffoonerys mask
and hook conceal his heroes in a cask 90
shall sapient managers new scenes produce

from cherry 91 skeffington 92 and mother goose xlvi 93
while shakespeare otway massinger forgot
on stalls must moulder or in closets rot
lo with what pomp the daily prints proclaim
the rival candidates for attic fame
in grim array though lewis spectres rise
still skeffington and goose divide the prize
and sure great skeffington must claim our praise
for skirtless coats and skeletons of plays
renowned alike whose genius neer confines

her flight to garnish greenwoods gay designs xlvii 94
nor sleeps with sleeping beauties but anon
in five facetious acts comes thundering on
while poor john bull bewildered with the scene
stares wondering what the devil it can mean
but as some hands applaud a venal few
rather than sleep why john applauds it too
such are we now ah wherefore should we turn
to what our fathers were unless to mourn
degenerate britons are ye dead to shame

or kind to dulness do you fear to blame
well may the nobles of our present race
watch each distortion of a naldis face
well may they smile on italys buffoons
and worship catalanis pantaloons 95
since their own drama yields no fairer trace
of wit than puns of humour than grimace 96
then let ausonia skilld in every art
to soften manners but corrupt the heart
pour her exotic follies oer the town

to sanction vice and hunt decorum down
let wedded strumpets languish oer deshayes
and bless the promise which his form displays
while gayton bounds before th enraptured looks
of hoary marquises and stripling dukes
let highborn lechers eye the lively presle
twirl her light limbs that spurn the needless veil
let angiolini bare her breast of snow
wave the white arm and point the pliant toe
collini trill her loveinspiring song

strain her fair neck and charm the listening throng
whet 97 not your scythe suppressors of our vice
reforming saints too delicately nice
by whose decrees our sinful souls to save
no sunday tankards foam no barbers shave
and beer undrawn and beards unmown display
your holy reverence for the sabbathday
or hail at once the patron and the pile
of vice and folly greville and argyle 98
where yon proud palace fashions hallowd fane

spreads wide her portals for the motley train
behold the new petronius 99 of the day xlviii
our arbiter of pleasure and of play
there the hired eunuch the hesperian choir
the melting lute the soft lascivious lyre
the song from italy the step from france
the midnight orgy and the mazy dance
the smile of beauty and the flush of wine
for fops fools gamesters knaves and lords combine
each to his humour—comus all allows 650
champaign dice music or your neighbours spouse
talk not to us ye starving sons of trade
of piteous ruin which ourselves have made
in plentys sunshine fortunes minions bask
nor think of poverty except en masque 100
when for the night some lately titled ass
appears the beggar which his grandsire was
the curtain dropped the gay burletta oer
the audience take their turn upon the floor
now round the room the circling dowgers sweep

now in loose waltz the thinclad daughters leap
the first in lengthened line majestic swim
the last display the free unfettered limb
those for hibernias lusty sons repair
with art the charms which nature could not spare
these after husbands wing their eager flight
nor leave much mystery for the nuptial night
oh blest retreats of infamy and ease
where all forgotten but the power to please
each maid may give a loose to genial thought

each swain may teach new systems or be taught
there the blithe youngster just returned from spain
cuts the light pack or calls the rattling main
the jovial casters set and sevens the nick
or—done—a thousand on the coming trick
if mad with loss existence gins to tire
and all your hope or wish is to expire
heres powells 101 pistol ready for your life
and kinder still two pagets for your wife xlix
fit consummation of an earthly race

begun in folly ended in disgrace
while none but menials oer the bed of death
wash thy red wounds or watch thy wavering breath
traduced by liars and forgot by all
the mangled victim of a drunken brawl
to live like clodius 102 and like falkland fall103
truth rouse some genuine bard and guide his hand
to drive this pestilence from out the land
een i—least thinking of a thoughtless throng
just skilled to know the right and choose the wrong

freed at that age when reasons shield is lost
to fight my course through passions countless host 104
whom every path of pleasures flowry way
has lured in turn and all have led astray—
een i must raise my voice een i must feel
such scenes such men destroy the public weal
altho some kind censorious friend will say
what art thou better meddling fool 105 than they
and every brother rake will smile to see
that miracle a moralist in me

no matter—when some bard in virtue strong
gifford perchance shall raise the chastening song
then sleep my pen for ever and my voice
be only heard to hail him and rejoice
rejoice and yield my feeble praise though i
may feel the lash that virtue must apply
as for the smaller fry who swarm in shoals
from silly hafiz up to simple bowles 106
why should we call them from their dark abode
in broad st giless or tottenhamroad

or since some men of fashion nobly dare
to scrawl in verse from bondstreet or the square l
if things of ton their harmless lays indite
most wisely doomed to shun the public sight
what harm in spite of every critic elf
sir t may read his stanzas to himself
miles andrews 107 still his strength in couplets try
and live in prologues though his dramas die
lords too are bards such things at times befall
and tis some praise in peers to write at all

yet did or taste or reason sway the times
ah who would take their titles with their rhymes 108
roscommon 109 sheffield 110 with your spirits fled 111
no future laurels deck a noble head
no muse will cheer with renovating smile
the paralytic puling of carlisle li 112
the puny schoolboy and his early lay
men pardon if his follies pass away
but who forgives the seniors ceaseless verse
whose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse

what heterogeneous honours deck the peer
lord rhymester petitmaître pamphleteer 113
so dull in youth so drivelling in his age
his scenes alone had damned our sinking stage
but managers for once cried hold enough
nor drugged their audience with the tragic stuff
yet at their judgment let his lordship laugh lii
and case his volumes in congenial calf
yes doff that covering where morocco shines
and hang a calfskin on those recreant lines 114

with you ye druids rich in native lead
who daily scribble for your daily bread
with you i war not giffords heavy hand
has crushed without remorse your numerous band
on all the talents vent your venal spleen 115
want is your plea let pity be your screen
let monodies on fox regale your crew
and melvilles mantle 116 prove a blanket too
one common lethe waits each hapless bard
and peace be with you tis your best reward

such damning fame as dunciads only give liii
could bid your lines beyond a morning live
but now at once your fleeting labours close
with names of greater note in blest repose
far bet from me unkindly to upbraid
the lovely rosas prose in masquerade
whose strains the faithful echoes of her mind
leave wondering comprehension far behind 117
though cruscas bards no more our journals fill 118
some stragglers skirmish round the columns still

last of the howling host which once was bells liv
matilda snivels yet and hafiz yells
and merrys 119 metaphors appear anew
chained to the signature of o p q 120
when some brisk youth the tenant of a stall
employs a pen less pointed than his awl
leaves his snug shop forsakes his store of shoes
st crispin quits and cobbles for the muse
heavens how the vulgar stare how crowds applaud
how ladies read and literati laud 121

if chance some wicked wag should pass his jest
tis sheer illnature—dont the world know best
genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme
and capel lofft 122 declares tis quite sublime
hear then ye happy sons of needless trade
swains quit the plough resign the useless spade
lo burns and bloomfield nay a greater far
gifford was born beneath an adverse star
forsook the labours of a servile state
stemmed the rude storm and triumphed over fate

then why no more if phoebus smiled on you
bloomfield why not on brother nathan too 123
him too the mania not the muse has seized
not inspiration but a mind diseased
and now no boor can seek his last abode
no common be inclosed without an ode
oh since increased refinement deigns to smile
on britains sons and bless our genial isle
let poesy go forth pervade the whole
alike the rustic and mechanic soul

ye tuneful cobblers still your notes prolong
compose at once a slipper and a song
so shall the fair your handywork peruse
your sonnets sure shall please—perhaps your shoes
may moorland weavers 124 boast pindaric skill
and tailors lays be longer than their bill
while punctual beaux reward the grateful notes
and pay for poems—when they pay for coats
to the famed throng now paid the tribute due lv
neglected genius let me turn to you

come forth oh campbell give thy talents scope
who dares aspire if thou must cease to hope
and thou melodious rogers rise at last
recall the pleasing memory of the past 125
arise let blest remembrance still inspire
and strike to wonted tones thy hallowed lyre
restore apollo to his vacant throne
assert thy countrys honour and thine own
what must deserted poesy still weep
where her last hopes with pious cowper sleep

unless perchance from his cold bier she turns
to deck the turf that wraps her minstrel burns
no though contempt hath marked the spurious brood
the race who rhyme from folly or for food
yet still some genuine sons tis hers to boast
who least affecting still affect the most lvi
feel as they write and write but as they feel—
bear witness gifford 126 sotheby 127 macneil 128
why slumbers gifford once was asked in vain
why slumbers gifford let us ask again 129

are there no follies for his pen to purge
are there no fools whose backs demand the scourge
are there no sins for satires bard to greet
stalks not gigantic vice in every street
shall peers or princes tread pollutions path
and scape alike the laws and muses wrath
nor blaze with guilty glare through future time
eternal beacons of consummate crime
arouse thee gifford be thy promise claimed
make bad men better or at least ashamed

unhappy white 130 while life was in its spring
and thy young muse just waved her joyous wing
the spoiler swept that soaring lyre away lvii 131
which else had sounded an immortal lay
oh what a noble heart was here undone
when science self destroyed her favourite son
yes she too much indulged thy fond pursuit
she sowed the seeds but death has reaped the fruit
twas thine own genius gave the final blow
and helped to plant the wound that laid thee low

so the struck eagle stretched upon the plain
no more through rolling clouds to soar again
viewed his own feather on the fatal dart
and winged the shaft that quivered in his heart
keen were his pangs but keener far to feel
he nursed the pinion which impelled the steel
while the same plumage that had warmed his nest
drank the last lifedrop of his bleeding breast
there be who say in these enlightened days
that splendid lies are all the poets praise

that strained invention ever on the wing
alone impels the modern bard to sing
tis true that all who rhyme—nay all who write
shrink from that fatal word to genius—trite
yet truth sometimes will lend her noblest fires
and decorate the verse herself inspires
this fact in virtues name let crabbe 132 attest
though natures sternest painter yet the best
and here let shee 133 and genius find a place
whose pen and pencil yield an equal grace

to guide whose hand the sister arts combine
and trace the poets or the painters line
whose magic touch can bid the canvas glow
or pour the easy rhymes harmonious flow
while honours doubly merited attend lviii
the poets rival but the painters friend
blest is the man who dares approach the bower
where dwelt the muses at their natal hour
whose steps have pressed whose eye has marked afar
the clime that nursed the sons of song and war

the scenes which glory still must hover oer
her place of birth her own achaian shore
but doubly blest is he whose heart expands
with hallowed feelings for those classic lands
who rends the veil of ages long gone by
and views their remnants with a poets eye
wright 134 twas thy happy lot at once to view
those shores of glory and to sing them too
and sure no common muse inspired thy pen
to hail the land of gods and godlike men 880
and you associate bards 135 who snatched to light lvix
those gems too long withheld from modern sight
whose mingling taste combined to cull the wreath
while attic flowers aonian odours breathe
and all their renovated fragrance flung
to grace the beauties of your native tongue
now let those minds that nobly could transfuse
the glorious spirit of the grecian muse
though soft the echo scorn a borrowed tone lx
resign achaias lyre and strike your own

let these or such as these with just applause lxi
restore the muses violated laws
but not in flimsy darwins 136 pompous chime lxii
that mighty master of unmeaning rhyme
whose gilded cymbals more adorned than clear
the eye delighted but fatigued the ear
in show the simple lyre could once surpass
but now worn down appear in native brass
while all his train of hovering sylphs around
evaporate in similes and sound

him let them shun with him let tinsel die
false glare attracts but more offends the eye 137
yet let them not to vulgar wordsworth 138 stoop
the meanest object of the lowly group
whose verse of all but childish prattle void
seems blessed harmony to lamb and lloyd 139
let them—but hold my muse nor dare to teach
a strain far far beyond thy humble reach
the native genius with their being given
will point the path and peal their notes to heaven 910
and thou too scott 140 resign to minstrels rude
the wilder slogan of a border feud
let others spin their meagre lines for hire
enough for genius if itself inspire
let southey sing altho his teeming muse lxiii
prolific every spring be too profuse
let simple wordsworth 141 chime his childish verse
and brother coleridge lull the babe at nurse lxiv
let spectremongering lewis aim at most lxv
to rouse the galleries or to raise a ghost

let moore still sigh let strangford steal from moore lxvi
and swear that camoëns sang such notes of yore
let hayley hobble on montgomery rave
and godly grahame chant a stupid stave
let sonneteering bowles 142 his strains refine
and whine and whimper to the fourteenth line
let stott carlisle 143 matilda and the rest
of grub street and of grosvenor place the best
scrawl on till death release us from the strain
or common sense assert her rights again

but thou with powers that mock the aid of praise
shouldst leave to humbler bards ignoble lays
thy countrys voice the voice of all the nine
demand a hallowed harp—that harp is thine
say will not caledonias annals yield
the glorious record of some nobler field
than the vile foray of a plundering clan
whose proudest deeds disgrace the name of man
or marmions acts of darkness fitter food
for sherwoods outlaw tales of robin hood lxvii

scotland still proudly claim thy native bard
and be thy praise his first his best reward
yet not with thee alone his name should live
but own the vast renown a world can give
be known perchance when albion is no more
and tell the tale of what she was before
to future times her faded fame recall
and save her glory though his country fall
yet what avails the sanguine poets hope
to conquer ages and with time to cope

new eras spread their wings new nations rise
and other victors fill th applauding skies 144
a few brief generations fleet along
whose sons forget the poet and his song
een now what onceloved minstrels scarce may claim
the transient mention of a dubious name
when fames loud trump hath blown its noblest blast
though long the sound the echo sleeps at last
and glory like the phoenix 145 midst her fires
exhales her odours blazes and expires

shall hoary granta call her sable sons
expert in science more expert at puns
shall these approach the muse ah no she flies
even from the tempting ore of seatons prize lxviii
though printers condescend the press to soil
with rhyme by hoare 146 and epic blank by hoyle lxix 147
not him whose page if still upheld by whist
requires no sacred theme to bid us list 148
ye who in grantas honours would surpass
must mount her pegasus a fullgrown ass

a foal well worthy of her ancient dam
whose helicon 149 is duller than her cam lxx
there clarke 150 still striving piteously to please lxxi
forgetting doggerel leads not to degrees
a wouldbe satirist a hired buffoon
a monthly scribbler of some low lampoon 151
condemned to drudge the meanest of the mean
and furbish falsehoods for a magazine
devotes to scandal his congenial mind
himself a living libel on mankind

oh dark asylum of a vandal race 152
at once the boast of learning and disgrace
so lost to phoebus that nor hodgsons 153 verse
can make thee better nor poor hewsons 154 worse lxxii
but where fair isis rolls her purer wave
the partial muse delighted loves to lave
on her green banks a greener wreath she wove lxxiii
to crown the bards that haunt her classic grove
where richards wakes a genuine poets fires
and modern britons glory in their sires 155 lxxiv

for me who thus unasked have dared to tell
my country what her sons should know too well lxxv
zeal for her honour bade me here engage lxxvi
the host of idiots that infest her age
no just applause her honoured name shall lose
as first in freedom dearest to the muse
oh would thy bards but emulate thy fame
and rise more worthy albion of thy name
what athens was in science rome in power
what tyre appeared in her meridian hour

tis thine at once fair albion to have been—
earths chief dictatress oceans lovely queen lxxvii
but rome decayed and athens strewed the plain
and tyres proud piers lie shattered in the main
like these thy strength may sink in ruin hurled lxxviii
and britain fall the bulwark of the world
but let me cease and dread cassandras fate
with warning ever scoffed at till too late
to themes less lofty still my lay confine
and urge thy bards to gain a name like thine 156

then hapless britain be thy rulers blest
the senates oracles the peoples jest
still hear thy motley orators dispense
the flowers of rhetoric though not of sense
while cannings colleagues hate him for his wit
and old dame portland 157 fills the place of pitt
yet once again adieu ere this the sail
that wafts me hence is shivering in the gale
and africs coast and calpes adverse height 158
and stambouls minarets must greet my sight

thence shall i stray through beautys native clime 159
where kaff 160 is clad in rocks and crowned with snows sublime
but should i back return no tempting press lxxix
shall drag my journal from the desks recess
let coxcombs printing as they come from far
snatch his own wreath of ridicule from carr
let aberdeen and elgin 161 still pursue
the shade of fame through regions of virtù
waste useless thousands on their phidian freaks
misshapen monuments and maimed antiques

and make their grand saloons a general mart
for all the mutilated blocks of art
of dardan tours let dilettanti tell
i leave topography to rapid 162 gell 163
and quite content no more shall interpose
to stun the public ear—at least with prose lxxx
thus far ive held my undisturbed career
prepared for rancour steeled gainst selfish fear
this thing of rhyme i neer disdained to own—
though not obtrusive yet not quite unknown

my voice was heard again though not so loud
my page though nameless never disavowed
and now at once i tear the veil away—
cheer on the pack the quarry stands at bay
unscared by all the din of melbourne house 164
by lambs resentment or by hollands spouse
by jeffreys harmless pistol hallams rage
edinas brawny sons and brimstone page
our men in buckram shall have blows enough
and feel they too are penetrable stuff

and though i hope not hence unscathed to go
who conquers me shall find a stubborn foe
the time hath been when no harsh sound would fall
from lips that now may seem imbued with gall
nor fools nor follies tempt me to despise
the meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes
but now so callous grown so changed since youth
ive learned to think and sternly speak the truth
learned to deride the critics starch decree
and break him on the wheel he meant for me

to spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss
nor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss
nay more though all my rival rhymesters frown
i too can hunt a poetaster down
and armed in proof the gauntlet cast at once
to scotch marauder and to southern dunce
thus much ive dared if my incondite lay lxxx
hath wronged these righteous times let others say
this let the world which knows not how to spare
yet rarely blames unjustly now declare 165

the biography of gilpin horner and the marvellous pedestrian page who travelled twice as fast as his masters horse without the aid of sevenleagued boots are chefs doeuvre in the improvement of taste for incident we have the invisible but by no means sparing box on the ear bestowed on the page and the entrance of a knight and charger into the castle under the very natural disguise of a wain of hay marmion the hero of the latter romance is exactly what william of deloraine would have been had he been able to read and write the poem was manufactured for messrs constable murray and miller worshipful booksellers in consideration of the receipt of a sum of money and truly considering the inspiration it is a very creditable production if mr scott will write for hire let him do his best for his paymasters but not disgrace his genius which is undoubtedly great by a repetition of blackletter ballad imitations

constable paid scott a thousand pounds for marmion and

offered one fourth of the copyright to mr miller of albemarle
street and one fourth to mr murray of fleet street see line 173
both publishers eagerly accepted the proposal
…
a severe and unjust review of marmion by jeffrey appeared in the
edinburgh review for april 1808 accusing scott of a mercenary
spirit in writing for money … scott was much nettled by these
observations

footnote 23 it was the suggestion of the countess of dalkeith that
scott should write a ballad on the old border legend of gilpin horner
which first gave shape to the poets ideas and led to the lay of the
last minstrel
