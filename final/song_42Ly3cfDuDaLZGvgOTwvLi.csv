this view used to bring a smile to my face
lately its done nothing but remind me of the way
the way that you used to give me butterflies
took me twentyone days to walk our former paradise
paradise

chorus
step by step brick by brick im reclaiming whats mine
this city is way too small to give away to just one guy
street by street breath by breath from the back bay to the sky
im taking back my city im taking back my life

verse 2
the café where you asked me for my name
the bookstore we spent five hours hiding from the rain
its like a game of monopoly except i steal back all my property
and leave you on the ground
and i know that ill see you one day on the street with a girl on your arm
but i wont let that keep me from this town

prechorus
from this town
from this town

chorus
step by step brick by brick im reclaiming whats mine
this city is way too small to give away to just one guy
street by street breath by breath from the back bay to the sky
im taking back my city im taking back my life
