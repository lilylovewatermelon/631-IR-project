theres just a part of this that makes me sick
that makes me sick
and i saw him wearing my tshirt that you dressed him in
so nice
so nice

theres nothing thats left that feels so good
and nothing ive seens misunderstood
so turn on your radio
i want all your friends to know its me
were coming in stereo
were coming in stereo

and i felt bad
so bad i had to laugh
and let it pass me by
again
now ive lost my place
drifting through alleyways and common space
alone
alone

theres nothing thats left that feels so good
and nothing ive seens misunderstood
so turn on your radio
i want all your friends to know its me
were coming in stereo
were coming in stereo
you might also likeand if your ears are burning try to listen
because mine catch fire with every second

cause youll feel left out when im the only one they talk about
but you still know something i have for you
the final show
cause i theres nothing thats left that feels so good
cause i and nothing ive seens misunderstood
so turn on your radio
i want all your friends to know its me
were coming in stereo
were coming in stereoembed"
