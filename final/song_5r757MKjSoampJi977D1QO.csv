i was just walking that day aimlessly oh oh no
you picked a perfect day to bump into me perfect day
probably shouldve watched the stars in the sky the night before
but for some reason we still met at your store you baby
your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
and i have my whole life and i listen well hey
look ill be your confidant
tell me anything
but please start it off with how you tuck your wings
oh

chorus
theres nothin else that i have seen
theres no getting around it or in between
youre out of this world
except youre not green
look you dont know what you mean
to me to me

verse 2
all my friends meet you and say youre the one
youre the one youre the one yeah
and all my meaningless friendships should be done
i should just leave them alone
you had a friend but he did you wrong
but im a godsent sign that reads please move on with me
you taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
use my heart forget my eyes
and thats the way to his kingdom of eternal life
since youre an angel baby your jobs never done
too bad the world wont see you when they dial 911 thats right

like you yeah
so why is it so complicated so complicated
what are you afraid of

bridge
ive been asking everybody what they think
but i dont know why because they dont know you
im even asking other guys what would they say
but i dont know why cause they dont do what i do
girl i say an ultimatums for you
but youd probably take that and just run
now i gotta decide if ima help raise your mind
seems like the ultimatums on me thats no fun
