there are things that i said i would never do
there are fears that i cannot believe have come true
for my soul is too sick and too little and too late
and myself i have grown too weary to hate

chorus
the more i stay in here the more its not so clear
the more i stay in here the more i disappear
as far as i have gone i knew what side im on
but now im not so sure the line begins to blur

verse 2
is there somebody on top of me i dont know i dont know
isnt anybody stoppin me i dont know i dont know
well im tryin to hold my breath i dont know i dont know
just how far down can i go i dont know i dont know i dont know

chorus
as i lie here and stare the fabric starts to tear
its far beyond repair and i dont really care
as far as i have gone i knew what side im on
but now im not so sure the line begins to blursee nine inch nails liveget tickets as low as 118you might also like6embed"
