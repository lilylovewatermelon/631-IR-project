theres nothin i could say to you
nothin i could ever do
to make you see what you mean to me
all the pain the tears i cried
still you never said goodbye
and now i know how far you’d go

prechorus
i know i let you down
but its not like that now
this time ill never let you go

chorus
i will be all that you want
and get myself together
cause you keep me from fallin apart
all my life ill be with you forever
to get you through the day
and make everything okay

verse 2
i thought that i had everything
i didnt know what life could bring
but now i see honestly
youre the one thing i got right
the only one i let inside
now i can breathe cause youre here with me
