loving you i thought i couldnt get no higher
your november rain could set the night on fire night on fire
but we could only burn so long
counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
know youre lyin when youre lyin next to me next to me
how did we get so far gone

prechorus
i should know by now
you should know by now
we should know by now

chorus
somethings gotta give somethings gotta break
but all i do is give and all you do is take
somethings gotta change but i know that it wont
no reason to stay is a good reason to go
is a good reason to go ooh

verse 2
i have never heard a silence quite so loud
i walk in the room and you dont make a sound make a sound
youre good at makin me feel small
if it doesnt hurt me why do i still cry
if it didnt kill me then im half alive half alive
how did we get so far gone
