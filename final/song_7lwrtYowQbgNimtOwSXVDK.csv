mary mary why you wanna do me this way

verse 1
i was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to
now im sitting here going crazy trying to crawl back to you

chorus
mary mary why you wanna do me this way

verse 2
but i was smart enough to come to my senses
be who you need me to be
and if you say that im too late
ill curl up and die in misery

chorus
mary mary why you wanna do me this way

bridge
i remember our first kiss on the fourth of july
ill never miss another one of those
ill be by your side

verse 3
if my foolish heart was wrong
this truly was never meant to be
well i only hope that hell count his lucky stars
and loves you as much as me
