questions ive got some questions
i want to know you
but what if i could ask you only one thing
only this one time what would you tell me

well maybe you could give me a suggestion
so i could know you what would you tell me
maybe you could tell me what to ask you
because then id know you what would you tell me
please tell me that theres time

chorus
to make this work for all intents and purposes
and what are your intentions will you try will you try

verse 2
impressions youve made impressions
theyre going nowhere
theyre just going to wait here if you let them
please dont let them i want to know you
and if theyre going to haunt me

please collect them please just collect them
and now im begging
im begging you to ask me just one question
one simple question
because then youd know me ill tell you that theres time

to make this work for all intents and purposes

outro
what is a heart worth if its just left all alone
if you leave it long enough and watch it turn into stone
must we all always be untrue
be untrue be untrue be untrueembed"
