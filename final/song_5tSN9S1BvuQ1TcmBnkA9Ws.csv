where you are seems to be
as far as an eternity
outstretched arms open hearts
and if it never ends then when do we start

prechorus
ill never leave you behind
or treat you unkind
i know you understand
and with a tear in my eye
give me the sweetest goodbye
that i ever did receive

chorus
pushing forward and arching back
bring me closer to heart attack
say goodbye and just fly away
when you come back
i have some things to say
how does it feel to know you never have to be alone
when you get home

verse 2
dream away everyday
try so hard to disregard
the rhythm of the rain that drops
and coincides with the beating of my heart
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeprechorus
ill never leave you behind
or treat you unkind
i know you understand
yeah oh oh
and with a tear in my eye
give me the sweetest goodbye
that i ever ever ever did receive

chorus
how does it feel to know you never have to be alone
when you get home
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go
so i can show you how i feel

outro
how does it feel to know you never have to be alone
when you get home
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go
so i can show you how i feel feel feel feelembed"
