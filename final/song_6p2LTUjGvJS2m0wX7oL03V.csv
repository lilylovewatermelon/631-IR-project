it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you
it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you

verse 1
when i first saw you come across the room
and then you saw me then i knew what to do
i tried to play it cool and attached no strings
but by the end of the day i needed the whole thing

chorus
it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you
it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you

verse 2
you see i knew right then that this could last so long
i went home that night i wrote my first love song
and as the days went by i knew i had it made
well you could try to pretend your smile gave it away

chorus
it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you
it feels good to be the one that you want
when all i want is you
