sung
be our guest be our guest
put our service to the test
tie your napkin round your neck cherie
and well provide the rest

soup du jour
hot hors doeuvres
why we only live to serve
try the grey stuff its delicious
dont believe me ask the dishes

they can sing they can dance
after all miss this is france
and a dinner here is never second best
go on unfold your menu
take a glance and then youll
be our guest
oui our guest
be our guest

lumière  chorus
beef ragout
cheese soufflé
pie and pudding en flambé
you might also likelumière
well prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret
youre alone
and youre scared
but the banquets all prepared
no ones gloomy or complaining
while the flatwares entertaining
we tell jokes i do tricks
with my fellow candlesticks

chorus
and its all in perfect taste
that you can bet

lumière  chorus
come on and lift your glass
youve won your own free pass
to be our guest

if youre stressed
its fine dining we suggest

lumière  chorus
be our guest be our guest be our guest

life is so unnerving
for a servant whos not serving
hes not whole without a soul to wait upon
ah those good old days when we were useful
suddenly those good old days are gone
ten years weve been rusting
needing so much more than dusting
needing exercise a chance to use our skills
most days we just lay around the castle
flabby fat and lazy
you walked in and oopsadaisy

mrs potts
its a guest its a guest
sakes alive well ill be blessed
wines been poured and thank the lord
ive had the napkins freshly pressed
with dessert shell want tea
and my dear thats fine with me
while the cups do their softshoein

for you our guest
chorus

chorus

its been years since weve had anybody here
and were obsessed
