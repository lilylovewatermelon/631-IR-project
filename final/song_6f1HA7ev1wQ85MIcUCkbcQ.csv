what happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground
do you pick up the pieces all around
and if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
take your chances turn around and go

all the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray
strange our life coincides with the seasons of today

i can find the strength to make it through the day
