refrain
red lipstick rose petals heartbreak
i was his marilyn monroe
brown eyes tuxedo fast cars
a james dean on the low
dean on the low

verse
i ask you whats the matter
you say oh its nothing at all
hearts racing outta control
and you knew that i couldnt let it go
you used to be this boy i loved
and i used to be this girl of your dreams
who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally
you took the best years of my life
i took the best years of your life
felt like love struck me in the night
i prayed that love dont strike twice

refrain
red lipstick rose petals heartbreak
i was his marilyn monroe
brown eyes tuxedo fast cars
a james dean on the low

marilyn monroe
whats love without tragedy
whats love without tragedy

part ii mother mary

verse 1
mother mary i swear i wanna change
mister jesus id love to be a queen
but im from the left side of an island
never thought this many people would even know my name
as time flies way above me
for you ive cried tears ceding
oh glory the prayers carry me
ill be a star you keep directing me
lets make the best scene theyve ever seen

verse 2
lets capture the moment
cause even forever aint forever
i swear by the moment
cause together aint promise forever
lets live in the moment
as long as we got each other
die in the moment
im prepared to die in the moment
cause even forever aint forever
i swear by the moment
cause together aint promise forever
lets live by the moment
as long as we got each other
die in the moment
im prepared to die in the moment
to die in the moment
