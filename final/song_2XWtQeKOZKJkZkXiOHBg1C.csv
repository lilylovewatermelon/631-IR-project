if heaven aint alot like detroit

i dont wanna go

if heaven aint alot like detroit

i just a soon stay home

if they aint got no eight mile

it would be about the same to me

it would be about the same to me

paradime

from aretha to aaliyah

to bob segar to
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likejoe louis n his arena and now me

paradime the mic of overachievers

smoking sewer caps bottom feeders and parking meters

a bunch of bad dudes in the mad brew and tattoos

so think twice before you pass through

or get clapped through whack crews get hurt

we can take you for a ride ride

or take you for your shirt shirt

i did it in the bronx i did in in queens

and you can see me do it do it down in new orleans

youll be picking all your teeth up from the fuckin pavement

youll get found face down with your pockets hangin out

i got more love for detroit then youll ever know

i know cats that sling crack and cats that scrap

cats that bust beer bottles over baseball caps

cats that get drunk and like to spark up skull cats

they keep sawed off chillin up in the trunks

we pound cans of strohs

we run the mitten from the river way up to the farms

thats why we get these fuckin ds tattooed on our arms
