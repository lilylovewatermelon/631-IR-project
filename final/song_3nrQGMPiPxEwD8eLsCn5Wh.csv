verse 1 nicole scherzinger
sometimes i feel ive got to run away
ive got to get away from the pain
you drive into the heart of me
the love we share seems to go nowhere
i think ive lost my light
for i toss and turn i cant sleep at night

chorus nicole scherzinger
once i ran to you i ran
now i run from you
this tainted love youve given
give you all a girl could give you
take my tears and thats not nearly all

refrain the pussycat dolls
tainted love
tainted love

verse 2 carmit bachar
now i know ive got to run away
ive got to get away
you dont really want any more from me
to make things right
you need someone to hold you tight
and youll think love is to pray
but im sorry i dont pray that way

part 2 where did our love go

verse nicole scherzinger
baby baby baby dont leave me
ooh please dont leave me all by myself
ive got this burning yearning yearning
feeling inside me ooh deep inside me
and it hurts so bad
you came into my heart so tenderly
with a burning love that stings like a bee
and now that i surrender so helplessly
you now wanna leave ooh you want to meet me
baby baby where did our love go
ooh dont you want me
dont you want me no moreembed"
