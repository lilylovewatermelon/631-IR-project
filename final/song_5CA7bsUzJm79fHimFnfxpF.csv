when the birds fly south and the snow come down and the crops all die
bitch im outside rolling these bones now bones be high
if i ever go broke like i was last year im not even gon lie
bitch i might ride bitch i might steal bitch you might die
browning logo moving slow mo
cohoctah woods but im still in noho
eyes like gopros i catch the low low
i see what you dont i know what you dont
ghillie suits now lined with goose down
skeptic critics say that im the proof now
hope they hate me i really mean that
change the game bitch who brought the scene back
let the fans down i picked the fans up
looking bend down we got our bands up
everything is just like im dreaming
if you aint you bitch you aint leaving
you aint breathing we aint teasing
always dropping never take a breather
showing up is just conceding
they wanna be us they wanna be us but they cant
could ride in beamers but we ride in vans
wanna see us they surround the van
but the window tint make sure they cant
im just tryna get home safe
roll me up a big ol 8
im just tryna get home safe
roll me up a big ol 8
feeling something like joni mitchell
ive seen some shit and speak on the issue
you live in hand but you talking pistol
tell me how the fuck that work when they come with missiles
they banging now you laying down
spraying rounds so you praying now
dont be barking if you aint gon bite
cause we all know people that will tonightyou might also like2embed"
