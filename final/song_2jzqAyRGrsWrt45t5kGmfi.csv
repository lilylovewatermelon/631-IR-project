its hot as hell in here
everybody wants to lose control
the musics turned up loud the lights
well turn them low
wound up like a hurricane
and my head is about to explode
cant wait to selfdestruct
cant wait to let it go

prechorus
woahoh she hits the stage
woahoh she makes me crave
so come and get my money
woahohohoh

chorus
i can feel your fever taking over
can you see your fever taking over me
i can feel your fever taking over
got a dirty feeling that youre the remedy
woah come on

verse 2
so im looking for a spark
ive got a body to reignite
dont worry you wont get burned
so dont dont put up a fight
push hard to breaking point
and im ready to overload
no limits and no regrets
its time to sell my soul
