i remember wasnt so long ago
we had a one room shack and the livin was low
and my mama by herself raised me and my bro
wasnt easy but we did it with the little that go
worked hard got us up for school every day
and kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
gave us pride to survive really showed us the way
now i really understood what she was tryin to say

prechorus shaggy
she said son therell be times when the tides are high
and the boat may be rocky you can cry
just never give up
you can never give up uhuh
in this life you could lead if you only believe
and in order to achieve what you need
you can never give up
you can never give up

boomboom couldnt have made it alone
i got a wonderful life two kids on my own
with a strong foundation that was carved in stone
and my mama for the love that made my house a home
made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
all this for a humble little guy like me
and all i ever really wanted was a family
to teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

prechorus shaggy
she said son therell be times when the tides are high
and the boat may be rocky you can cry
just never give up
you can never give up uhuh
in this life you could lead if you only believe
and in order to achieve what you need
you can never give up
you can never give up
