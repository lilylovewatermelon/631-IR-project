im a bad man
james dean kinda steve mcqueen
straight out the badlands
i rolled in and rained down
like a storm cloud or a heat wave
made you stay undercover where its safe
dont give a damn about the plans you made
were staying in the bed all day

chorus
cause im selfish
restless like a river cant help it
im taking what you give me but i still want more
i still want more
cause im selfish
yeah im selfish im selfish for you

verse 2
have you seen yourself in a fulllength mirror
spinning around lately
id lie cheat and steal
feel the sweet scent overtake me
but the lord sent an angel to save me
so he cant blame me
when my hands get a mind of their own
girl if they get ahold of you i aint never letting go
