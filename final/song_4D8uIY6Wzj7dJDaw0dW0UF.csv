theres a story that my daddy tells religiously
like clockwork every time he sees an opening
in a conversation bout the way things used to be

verse 2
well i just roll my eyes and make a bline for the door
but id always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
hanging onto every word man the things i heard

bridge 1
it was harder times and longer days
five miles to school uphill both ways
we were caneswitch raised and dirt floor poor
course that was back before the war

prechorus 1
yea your uncle and i made quite a pair
flying f15s through hostile air
he went down but they missed me by a hair
hed always stop right there and say

chorus
thats something to be proud of
thats a life you can hang your hat on
as your chins held high as the tears fall down
gut sucked in chest stuck out
like a small town flag a flying
or a new born baby crying
in the arms of the woman that you love
thats something to be proud of

son graduating college that was mommas dream
and i was on my way to anywhere else when i turned eighteen
cause when you got a fast car and think you got everything

verse 4
i learned real quick those gtos dont run off faith
i ended up broken down in some town north of la
working maximum hours for minimum wage

bridge 2
well i fell in love next thing i know
the babies came and the car got sold
sure do miss that old hot rod
but you sure save gas in them foreign jobs

prechorus 2
dad i wonder if i ever let you down
if youre ashamed how i turned out
well he lowered his voice then he raised his brow
said let me tell you right now

chorus 2
thats something to be proud of
thats a life you can hang your hat on
you dont need to make a million just be thankful to be working
if youre doing what youre able
putting food there on the table
and providing for the family that you love
thats something to be proud of
prechorus 3
and if all you ever really do is the best you can
well you did it man

chorus
thats something to be proud of
thats a life you can hang your hat on
as your chins held high as the tears fall down
gut sucked in chest stuck out
like a small town flag a flying
or a new born baby crying
in the arms of the woman that you love
thats something to be proud of

outro
thats something to be proud of
now thats something to be proud of
thats something to be proud of
now thats something to be proud of1embed"
