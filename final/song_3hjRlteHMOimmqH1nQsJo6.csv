ticking clock
i walk away 
from the soundless room

windless night 
moonlight melts
my ghostly shadow 
to the lukewarm gloom

nightly dance
of bleeding swords
reminds me that
i still live

i will 
burn my dread
i once ran away from the god of fear
and he chained me to despairyeah
burn my dread
i will break the chain and run
till i see the sunlight again

ill lift my face
and run to the sunlight
you might also likevoiceless town
tapping feet
i clench my fist
in pockets tight
far in mist a tower waits
like a merciless tomb
devouring moonlight
clockwork maze 
end unknown
in frozen time 
a staircase stands
shadows crawl 
on bloodstained floor
i rush straight ahead 
with a sword in hands

cold touch of
my trembling gun
i close my eyes
to hear you breathe

burn my dread x2
i will
burn my dread
this time ill grapple down that god of fear
and throw him into hells fire
burn my dread
i will shrug the pain and run
till i see the sunlight again
oh i will run
burning all regret and dread
and i will face the sun 
with pride of the livingembed"
