used to be called a bunch of things before they called me now leopard
i froze up and shivered off the shards of cold weather with no effort
leather belt around my throat feels so better than the rope i had before
the results are the same but now im comfy when i go
i got hoes that burn their wrist with the blunt they rolled for me
and now im always stoned always home alone
in the back of the benz i got my squad i know
but i only see them on the road
and the rest i know just wanna use you
they always wanna use you
snakes in my face yeah i think im medusa
polo pajamas with the pockets ripped the red white and blue ones
thats why im always losing money but dont let that confuse you
cause now i got a mouth full of gold but baby im still a loser
