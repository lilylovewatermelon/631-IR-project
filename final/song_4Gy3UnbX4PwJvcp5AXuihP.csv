when faith alone is not enough
to keep our heads barely above
we look for reason and come up emptyhanded
and when our children fight our wars
while we sit back just keeping score
were teaching murder not understanding now

chorus
were setting the fires to light the way
were burning it all to begin again
with hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
we sing for change

verse 2
the lives our buried sons have laid
will cancel debts weve yet to pay
how could we justify anything now
as long as we blindly obey and do exactly what they say
well have no one to blame but ourselves now

chorus
were setting the fires to light the way
were burning it all to begin again
with hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
we sing for change

we run on the fumes of injustice
well never die with the fuel that you give us
keep it coming cause im prepared to burn
keep running from me at every turn
your life around
into something true into something true
so turn your life around
into something true something true

chorus
were setting the fires to light the way
were burning it all to begin again
with hope in our hearts and bricks in our hand
we sing for change3embed"
