we get further and further and further
from what we must do

i saw you asleep beside a wall
your skull inside a ball
your eyes blackened by the sound
and the thought of god

where should i hang my head
where would you like for me to hang my head

one absence of truth
the one horrible thing i saw
what you truly wanted to become
and who you thought i was
the fall the fall afraid to love
runs deeper than the grave
goes all the way down those tracks

everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
a complete contradiction a waste

in this hole that we have fixed
we get further and further
from what we must do
i know this i know this
you know this you know this

we get further and further and further
from what we must do

i saw you outside that wall
your skull outside that wall
your eyes perceived by the sound
and the light of god1embed"
