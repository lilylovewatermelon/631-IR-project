i could lift you up
i could show you what you want to see
and take you where you want to be
you could be my luck

i know that well be safe and sound

i could show you love
in a tidal wave of mystery
youll still be standing next to me
you could be my luck
even if were six feet underground
i know that well be safe and sound
were safe and sound
were safe and sound
