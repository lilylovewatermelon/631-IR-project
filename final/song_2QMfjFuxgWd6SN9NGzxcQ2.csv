ive been here a bunch of times
it all stats with the same old lines its over baby its over
nothing about it ever feels good
it knocks you down just like it should
but it goes away it always goes away
something about this time feels different
its like im in a fight im about to lose

chorus
this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting
it just keeps working on me
it just keeps picking on me
and these might be the tears that keep on falling
they wont stop coming on down
they wont stop raining on down
and baby its too early to know for certain
but this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting

verse 2
man ive tried to kill the pain by shooting whiskey through my brain
but it never works it only makes it worse
so tonight im here again throwing punches in the wind
at some memory that i cant even see
i know that i dont want to let it have me
but every time it hits i feel the truth
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting
it just keeps working on me
it just keeps picking on me
and these might be the tears that keep on falling
they wont stop coming on down
they wont stop raining on down
and baby its too early to know for certain
but this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting

bridge
tomorrow ill stand up again
and give it my best shot again
but tonight it sure feels like

chorus
these might be the tears that keep on falling
they wont stop coming on down
they wont stop raining on down
and baby its too early to know for certain
but this might be the heartache that dont stop hurting
