youre sweet just like the sun
but what happens when the sun doesnt stay
the night reminds me when you went away i dont care i dont care
now my mind was pacing heart is racing contemplating things that i lack
even though you left me by myself do i want you back

prechorus
will you stay or will you walk
will you let go
leave me all alone
im giving you one more chance
to make things last
ring around the roses then shell stay

chorus
leave me once
leave me twice
kiss goodbye that will suffice
when you go away
dont look back
leave me once and ill be fine
leave me twice ill make you mine
just one more chance to make it once again

verse 2
as the days go by i am asking why did you leave
you left me alone and then you walked out on me i dont care i dont care
thinking of days thinking of ways thinking of things to you that i should say
i want to be with you and thats the only way
