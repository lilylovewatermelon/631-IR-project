once out in the rain
i was able to strangle my shadow then shackle the chain chain
what what will you do
is it safe to play god in the garden and king of the zoo you
holes well they need to be filled
positions available yet some are quite hard to get out of or in in

chorus
spinning in the daffodils
dizzy from a dozen twirls
spinning in the daffodils

interlude
yeah yeah

verse 2
cold alone and alive
youre afraid but thats not what i asked wanna go for a ride
sharpen your teeth my darlings sharpen your minds
take a finger if the hand feeds you shit take one scalp at a time
get em or else yeah yeahyeah

verse 3
fail as big as the whale
like a canine that chases the bone thats tied to its tail
i wish i was a beautiful balloon
i could rise up above it all and then fade out of view fade
gracefully fade fade out of view
what have you turned me into
