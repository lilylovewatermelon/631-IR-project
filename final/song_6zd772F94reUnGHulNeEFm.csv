coward

chorus
spit
i think ill spit

verse 1
for all those girls who speak contradiction
the guy who crept through the shadows every day
to clutch his own conclusion
watch all the blood as it drips from your veins
you coward
godspeed
may your death come quickly

chorus
i think ill
take this hate and
spit
spit
spit

verse 2

i feel the blood rush come right over me
you know you will never be right
in the eyes of the ones who know
you trusted the devil she will betray you
you might also likebridge
low

outro
why do i get shit all the time
from you men you are swine
you think dick is the answer
but its not
why do i get shit all the time
from you men you are swine
you think dick is the answer
but its not1embed"
