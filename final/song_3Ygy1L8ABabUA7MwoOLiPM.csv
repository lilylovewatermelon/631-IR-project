oh
oh oh

verse 1
what a world that im livin in
will the rainstorms ever end
still i feel my path narrow i run again
seem happiness is gone again
and then you see em grey clouds up above mane
metaphoric to my life mane
still i feel my heart stronger than its ever been
strong will til my journey ends
until then i roll more than i ever rolled
not pills but the mary though
still i feel my eyes heavy when the day goes
nothin helpin when my head doze
but i aint sleep awake in another state
livin in a new space
still i feel my mind runnin at a steady pace
god help me so ill win the race until then i go

verse 2
grey clouds stuck together fam
lightning piercing through another land
over the desert where the lost play
soul searchin each and every way
and then you see the awesome sound so profound
when itâ€”itll grip you
you can see it if you hear it you can feel it too
somethin special i am runnin to
until then i go away very far away
to another universe where all the people say
its the newnew place for the special to embrace
like a martian who seemingly wandered out of place
take what you need from the valley of the hope where
even if you drown youll be floatin higher up and
you can say bye bye bye
sky might be fallin but remember you can fly high
chorus
ahh the sky might fall
ahh the sky might fall
ahh ahh but im not worried at all cmon cmon
ahh the sky might fall
ahh the sky might fall
ahh ahh but im not worried at all
