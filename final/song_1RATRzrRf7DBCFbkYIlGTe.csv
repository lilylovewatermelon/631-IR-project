this song is not for the living
this song is for the dead

verse corey taylor
with my face against the floor
i cant see who knocked me out of the way
i dont want to get back up
but i have to so it might as well be today
nothing appeals to me no one feels like me
im too busy being calm to disappear
im in no shape to be alone
contrary to the shit that you might hear

chorus corey taylor
so walk with me walk with me
dont let this symbolism kill your heart
walk with me walk with me
just like we shouldve done right from the start
walk with me walk with me
dont let this fucking world tear you apartsee slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also like26embed"
