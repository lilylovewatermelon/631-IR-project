he knew what he wanted to say
but he didnt know how to word it
the dirty little herbert was seeking an escape
but the place was wellguarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

i think you should know youre his favourite worst nightmare

that had led him to be in a position
on the brink of a mission
and every other episode

hes nearing the brink but he thinks first
