verse 1 lil baby
christian dior on my shoes
they cost a band i prolly wont wear again
lil mizzy just came on the news
im thinkin damn he back in trouble again
made me a mil cause i can
i know who i am and i give thanks to the man
the tiger just jumped out the can
thats my lil man right back gettin action again
that young nigga shit we still on it
my dawg goin through it i feel for him
she told me she love me i fell for it
got real niggas sittin in jail for it
buy the pack ima put it in the mail for it
on the hunt for the money i smell for it
i went big dawg on them this tom ford
that lil boy shit i aint goin for it
gettin money every day i wake up
dont ask me did me and lil shawty break up

ran the money up way up
life aint sweet aint no layup
drip for sale they gotta pay us
i stayed down and i came up
stayed the same and they changed up
i knew they was gon change up
money never gon change us
i just be in my lane stuck

verse 2 gunna
i parked the bentley inside the garage
i dont know how much hate i can dodge
i can get you knocked off with a nod
4 pockets full everyone got a knot
i say this shit from the heart
i knew you werent real you werent there from the start
anything good in my way came from god
go get on stage and i get an applause
damn young gunna done growed up
back to back the coupes they know its us
my bro took a loss and i picked him up
we stick together they aint rich as us
i wanna sit down she aint lit enough
every time i count cash swear i get a rush
my money long as the yellow bus
it aint no secret im livin plush
chorus lil baby
ran the money up way up
life aint sweet aint no layup
cook that shit up quay
drip for sale they gotta pay us
i stayed down and i came up
stayed the same and they changed up
i knew they was gon change up
money never gon change us
i just be in my lane stuck

outro lil baby
ran the money up way up
life aint sweet aint no layup
money never gon change us
i just be in my lane stuck
stayed the same and they changed up
i knew they was gon change up12embed"
