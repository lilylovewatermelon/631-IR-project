verse 1
for my theme song black
my leather black jeans on black
my byanymeans on
pardon im getting my scream on black
enter the kingdom black
but watch who you bring home
they see a black man with a white woman
at the top floor they gone come to kill king kong
middle america packed in black
came to see me in my black skin black
number one question theyre askin
fuck every question you askin black
if i dont get ran out by catholics black
here come some conservative baptists
claiming im overreactin
like them black kids in chiraq bitch

chorus
four in the mornin and im zonin
they say im possessed its an omen
i keep it 300 like the romans
300 bitches where the trojans

these niggas aint ready for action
ready—ready for action—action
chorus
four in the mornin and im zonin

ive been a menace for the longest
but i aint finished im devoted
and you know it and you know it
