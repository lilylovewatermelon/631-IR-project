well patience never was one of your true virtues
stop trying to control everything and fuck what they say
what do you have to prove

so why am i waiting
this time that im wasting
if thats what you mean
so why am i waiting
this time that im wasting
if thats what you mean

how will this be when all is said and done
will i know where im from remember me
where will i be
i guess im on the run
and time is catching up behind me
behind me yeah
behind me you
behind me

and im scared to be the only one
who sees the hourglass empty cuz too much time went by
why do i try to prove that i will be ready for everything thrown at me

so why am i waiting
this time that im wasting
if thats what you mean
so why am i waiting
this time that im wasting
if thats what you mean
