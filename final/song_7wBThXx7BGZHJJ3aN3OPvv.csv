chorus
these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man im throwed and i dont know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if im gonna tell it then i gotta tell it all all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
im so throwed i dont know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions

verse 1

got me talking to myself asking how im gon tell you
bout that chick on part one i told yall i was creepin with creepin with
said shes three months pregnant and shes keepin it
the first thing that came to mind was you
second thing was how do i know if its mine and is it true
third thing was me wishing that i never did what i did
how i aint ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

this by far is the hardest thing i think ive ever had to do
to tell you the woman i love

and hopefully youll give me another chance
this aint about my career
this aint about my life
