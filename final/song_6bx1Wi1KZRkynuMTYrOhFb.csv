you know life ain’t tied with a bow but it’s still a gift though
yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
it’s a blessing just to be here

hook
i know you’re money hungry
can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
and you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
i understand the ups and the downs street niggas gon’ relate
it’s a struggle man i’m with you all the way
this for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
i gotta thank god for everything
it’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
everything 1k

verse 1
i woke up in the morning on a cold slab
how the hell i’m in a damn cell
i’m in jail taking cold baths
i went down the wrong path
lil boy don’t go that way
you prolly won’t last
before i had the fame i had the name
i earned my stripes like adidas
sliding base like i’m derek jeter
growing up with no father it’ll make you evil
how he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him
youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the desert eagle
look how she left i bet she told you she won’t never leave you
the same nigga was hating i turned them to believers
i done made it through the rain and i ain’t called fema

i know you’re money hungry
can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
and you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
i understand the ups and the downs street niggas gon’ relate
it’s a struggle man i’m with you all the way
this for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
i gotta thank god for everything
it’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face

verse 2
i probably thank god ‘cause without him who is me
he unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
jailbird i was caged in he came and set me free
i was just on the news now i’m on mtv
hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
grinding for a mil and i ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
my mama need a crib i been thinking ‘bout a condo
you nothing when you down it’s crazy how people treat you
come around now you can’t even hit the reefer
i pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
brother from the same struggle cut from the same cloth
hook
i know you’re money hungry
can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
and you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
i understand the ups and the downs street niggas gon’ relate
it’s a struggle man i’m with you all the way
this for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
i gotta thank god for everything
it’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
