theres no reason theres no compromise
change in seasons living the high life
i dont know you so dont freak on me
i cant control you youre not my destiny

chorus
straight out of line i cant find a reason
why i should justify my ways
straight out of line i dont need a reason
you dont need to lie to me

verse 2
ill confess this youre my tragedy
i laid you to rest just as fast as you turned on me
gone forever banished the memories
displays of pleasure are masked by your misery

chorus
straight out of line i cant find a reason
why i should justify my ways
straight out of line i dont need a reason
you dont need to lie to me
lie to me
