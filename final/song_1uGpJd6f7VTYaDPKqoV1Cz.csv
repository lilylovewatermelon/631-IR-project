yeah i told you before
and ill tell you again
this life i live
has been forged
and im backwards fire
with some hella wind
so when i walk through that door
get me a heavy pour

ive had a long damn day
im a grown ass man
dont care about the jukebox
dont give a damn
only plan is let the hell out around tonight
ive been down and ive been up
ive been through hell and ive had enough
so when i walk through that door
get me a heavy pour
