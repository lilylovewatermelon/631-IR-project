i am eight years old
daddy is cutting my hair
aqua velva on his hands
momma is in the kitchen
got fried green tomatoes
popping in the pan
i see a home run a goal line
holding my friend getting baptized
i see her beautiful face under that veil
as she is walking down the aisle

chorus
i can hear the sirens coming
smell the gasoline and smoke
i am pinned against this steering wheel
pretty sure my arm is broke
i can see the flames and my life
flashing right before my eyes
i hope they get to me in time

verse 2
i could see the headlights swerve
so i cut the wheel to the right
last thing i saw was that bottle turned up
as he crossed that center line
i see tiny hands brown eyes
falling to sleep to that lullaby
and you slide over next to me
as i turn out the lights

verse 3
please lord i am begging you
do not let me go like this
there is so much left that i want to do
so much i do not want to miss

i can see the flames and my life
flashing right before my eyes
i hope they get to me in time
just get to me in time
please get to me in in timeembed"
