i close my front door and turn on the light
i let out a breath and hold in a sigh
aint nothin new aint that much in sight
and if im counting days dream fruition aint what its looking like

chorus
but strictly speaking im still on track
strictly speaking im holding on
more than a minor setback
but strictly speaking im still on track
and all of my dreams are still in sight
cause strictly speaking ive got my whole life
i lost a wheel a while back
but strictly speaking im still on track
challenges falling in my lap
strung out again but still on track

verse 2
i know its unrealistic overoptimistic
i know i tried before this i know its nearly august
i know i cant ignore this looking forward to all this
sayin babe i just adore this and babe can we afford this
i know its been a slow year nothin much to show here
i didnt really go for it so not a lot to show for it

the hardest part is over adjusting makes it slower
so glad youre comin over a wall to bring us closer
the world aint waitin for ya nothin to lose it over
were just a little older the rest comes easy
the rest comes easy

chorus
cause lifes like that
but strictly speaking im still on track
strictly speaking im holding back
troubles keep falling in my lap
yeah but strictly speaking im still on track
so tell everyone ill be alright
cause strictly speaking ive got my whole life
more than one major setback
but strictly speaking im still on track yeah

refrain
the hardest part is over adjusting makes it slower ooh
so glad youre comin over a wall to bring us closer still on track motherfucker
the world aint waitin for ya nothin to lose it over
were just a little older the rest gets easy
