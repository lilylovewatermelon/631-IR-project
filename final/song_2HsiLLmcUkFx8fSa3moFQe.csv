downtown tonight
i saw an old friend
someone who i use to take comfort from long before i met you
i saw a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire
with a word or a touch i couldve rekindled that fire

chorus
but old flames cant hold a candle to you
no one can light up the night like you do
flickering embers of love ive known one or two
but old flames cant hold a candle to you

verse 2
sometimes at night i think of old lovers ive known
remember em holding them helps me not feel so alone
and i feel you beside me
and even their memories are gone like stars in the night
lost in the sweet light of dawn

chorus
but old flames cant hold a candle to you
no one can light up the night like you do
flickering embers of love
flickering embers of love ive known one or two
old flames cant hold a candle to you mmmyou might also likeembed"
