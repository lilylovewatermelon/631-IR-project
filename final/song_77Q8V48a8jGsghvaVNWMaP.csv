the night is gettin late the crowds headed home
its just you and me girl on the lake shore
i know i just met you but i cant let you go
forget about your friends baby ill drive you home yeah

verse 2
ill set you on the tailgate well take it nice and slow
i know it aint your stop but i wont tell a soul no

prechorus
i know you gotta wake up for that nine to five
but whats the point of livin girl
if you dont feel alive

chorus
we can sleep when were dead the night is still young
pour another drink talk that song
bout small town lovers hot summer nights
midnight dancin in the headlights
some day we might regret leavin that love out by the lake
if youre gettin tired honey well put that thought to bed
but we can sleep when were dead

verse 3
put your pretty arms around me now get in nice and close
whisper in my ear what youd like to know
now you can tell me bout your family or tell me bout your day
or our lips can do the talking lets listen baby what do you say

i know its kinda crazy for a tuesday night
but sometimes a good thing dont need time

chorus
we can sleep when were dead the night is still young
pour another drink talk that song
bout small town lovers hot summer nights
midnight dancin in the headlights
some day we might regret leavin that love out by the lake
if youre gettin tired honey well put that thought to bed

bridge
with a smile she pulled me to water
them southern girls man they just dont get any hotter
i said no girl got on my good jeans
she looked at me boy like what do you mean

chorus
we can sleep when were dead the night is still young
jump on in lets have a little fun
small town lovers hot summer nights
out here swimmin in the moonlight
some day we might regret leavin this love out by the lake
but no matter what you do dont forget what we said
we can sleep when were dead
we can sleep when were dead aww yeah
we can sleep when were deadembed"
