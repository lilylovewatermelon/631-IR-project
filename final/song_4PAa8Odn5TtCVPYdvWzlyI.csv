somebody give me a sign
that everythings going as planned
and then everything falls away
into the darkness of this shallow place
the detail is striking the rooms cold and frightening
youll kick and youll scream youll try everything to survive
but you should know your fate by now

prechorus
they told me how i should be
but i broke the mold somehow

chorus
its too late too late
you keep trying to resolve the past right now
but i swear ill be the one
to let the world know what youve done to me

verse 2
you you know you gotta assert yourself
leave what you need for now
its not the time or place youre searching for
all i can give thems my worst of intentions
youre nothing to me and everyone can see that your lifes a lie
theres nowhere left to hide
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likeprechorus
they told me how i should be
but i broke the mold somehow

chorus
its too late too late
you keep trying to resolve the past right now
but i swear ill be the one
to let the world know what youve done to me
its too late too late
you keep trying to resolve the past right now
but i swear ill be the one
to let the world know what youve done to me

bridge
watch your back youll lose yourself
this is a battleground
when will they know
your lifes a lie

chorus
its too late too late
you keep trying to resolve the past right now
but i swear ill be the one
to let the world know what youve done
somebody give me a sign
its too late too late
that everythings going as planned
you keep trying to resolve the past right now
and then everything falls away
but i swear ill be the one
into the darkness of this shallow place
to let the world know what youve done
