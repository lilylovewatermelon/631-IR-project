you asked if i was feeling it im psycho high
know you wont remember in the morning when i speak my mind
lights are on and theyve gone home but who am i
oh how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses
we told you this was melodrama
oh how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses
our only wish is melodrama
oh how fast the evening passes
cleaning up the champagne glasses

verse 2
and the terror and the horror
when we wonder why we bother whoa whoa
and the terror and the horror
god i wonder why we bother whoa whoa
all the glamour and the trauma
and the fuckin melodrama whoa whoa
all the gun fights and the lime lights
and the holy sick divine nights whoa
holy sick divine nights whoa
theyll talk about us all the lovers
how we kiss and kill each other whoa
theyll talk about us and discover
how we kissed and killed each other whoa
and well tell them
