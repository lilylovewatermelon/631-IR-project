i am my mothers only one
its enough
i wear my garment so it shows
now you know

chorus
only love is all maroon
gluey feathers on a flume
sky is womb and shes the moon

verse 2
i am my mother on the wall
with us all
i move in water shore to shore
nothings more

chorus
only love is all maroon
lapping lakes like leery loons
leaving rope burns reddish rouge
instrumental break

chorus
only love is all maroon
gluey feathers on a flume
sky is womb and shes the moonyou might also like26embed"
