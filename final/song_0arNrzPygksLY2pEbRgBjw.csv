late night brakes lock hear the tires squeal
red light cant stop so i spin the wheel
my world goes black before i feel an angel lift me up
and i open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white
they flip the siren hit the lights
close the doors and i am gone

verse 1
now i lay here owing my life to a stranger
and i realize that empty words are not enough
im left here with the question of just
what have i to show except
the promises i never kept
i lie here shaking on this bed
under the weight of my regrets

chorus
i hope that i will never let you down
i know that this can be more than just
flashing lights and sound

verse 2
look around and youll see that at times
it feels like no one really cares
it gets me down but im still gonna try to do whats right
i know that theres
a difference between sleight of hand
and giving everything you have
theres a line drawn in the sand
im working up the will to cross it
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
i hope that i will never let you down
i know that this can be more than just
flashing lights and sound

bridge
rhetoric cant raise the dead
im sick of always talking when theres no change
rhetoric cant raise the dead
im sick of empty words lets lead and not follow

late night brakes lock hear the tires squeal
red light cant stop so i spin the wheel
my world goes black before i feel an angel steal me from the
greedy jaws of death and chance and
pull me in with steady hands
theyve given me a second chance
the artist in the ambulance

outro
i hope that i will never let you down
i know that this can be more than just
flashing lights and sound
can we pick you off the ground
more than flashing lights and sound1embed"
