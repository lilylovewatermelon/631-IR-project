the bluest skies dont seem so blue
and the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
now that youre around you put em all to shame
let me break it down cause what im trying to say is

chorus
no one gets me like you when you kiss me
girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
i thought i knew what love was but i didnt have a clue
i never found anything that makes me feel like i do about you

verse 2
gotta whole new direction it seems these days
i used to rush off to work and get home late
but now i show up late and rush back home
my priorities are different i cant leave you alone

chorus
no one gets me like you when you kiss me
girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
i thought i knew what love was but i didnt have a clue
i never found anything that makes me feel like i do about you
