verse 1
yeah look aye
you got that heat
boy i came to kill the game you aint gotta ask twice
if you aint ready for the fame get up out my lane nigga this the fast life
im tryna cop a couple chains and a diamond rang shining like a flashlight
and have them sayin damn thats nice i aint never seen nothin that bright
like thats right
i know you heard about the name you aint gotta act like it
besides im worried bout the deals making hella sales
tryna get the cash right
i wanna eat the type of meals niggas probably still couldnt get at half price
and buy a crib up in the hills for a couple mil did it with my skill
niggas better act right beside me
if its drama there you cant find me
niggas sell they soul you cant buy me
i aint never gettin on my knees
i dont want friends or colleagues
why the fuck you worried about what i eat
if a nigga hungry come try me i got seafood and chinese
i serve em like its nothin til im stuntin overseas
bitch stop frontin hoe you know you cant put nothin over me
im the hottest fuckin youngin they been bumpin my releases
you gon see this wavy flow gon make them sea sick

okay look
aaron may commit murders
aaron may cop converters
aaron may switch the flow up to some shit you never ever heard of
fuck anyone who say he not the way he bring hell better pray he stop
the minute this blow he a school dropout
have you seen an ap with an ap watch
or a bentley a brand new range
hundred thousand inside the bank
my dreams are just not the same i aint finna work for no pocket change
and i dont ask nigga i proclaim
i let you know we is not the same
i give you work i do not complain
im winnin now who you got to blame
