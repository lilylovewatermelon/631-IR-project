its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
i swore that i would change when no one was around
now im gasping for air like im about to drown
but here i go with that codeine in that white cup with the cocaine on that counter
swear to god i wasnt looking for no problems when i found them
its a long way when you falling down when you sitting on top of that mountain
cause ive been living life with no boundaries

prechorus
ive been living with a heart thats full of coke
ooh im so out of control
im better off being alone
ooh im so out of control

chorus jelly roll
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
i swore that i would change but i aint changed yеt im fucked up
i swore that i would change but i aint changеd yet

verse 2 merkules
what up jelly
im still tryna learn all the dos and the donts
abusive im used to just losing control
what a loser i choose to be stupid i know
im using this music its sooth for the soul
its hard for me to admit this is reality
im still tryna cope with this addictive personality
ive been feeling like the victim to insanity
thats probably why i keep on drinking through the agony
i start my day with a shot and a cigarette
i noticed if im drunk then im not gonna get upset
even had a dream that i lost all my innerrest
sevenday bender all i gots like a mickey left
now i gotta try to drown all the voices
got a lot of problems but im bound to avoid em
guess i gotta learn how to make choices
im drunk right now so its pointless

ive been living with a heart thats full of coke
ooh im so out of control
im better off being alone
ooh im so out of control

chorus jelly roll
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
i swore that i would change but i aint changed yet im fucked up
i swore that i would change but i aint changed yet

verse 3 futuristic
i know how it goes
here i go with that double cup
had a good thing ima fuck it up
couple old homies used to run with us
got themselves jumped like double dutch
cause the  they been out of bounds
i been round the town young and wylin out
look at my accounts know im really winning
but inside an ocean in my mind i drown
i aint wanna be all that
they wonder how i seen all that
now i really been a fiend ah yeah
lost you cause the dream all bad
my problems solved when that bottle calls
then my psycho runs like the the dryer
i take two hits to get higher
look outside the sun start to rising
chorus jelly roll
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
its 5 am and im fucked up again
about to watch the sun come busting in
i swore that i would change but i aint changed yet im fucked up
i swore that i would change but i aint changed yet swore that i would change but i aint changed yetembed"
