im alive again
more alive than i have ever been
and now im climbing climbing to the top to win
and nothings gonna stop stop me in the end victorious

prechorus
and every day that i awake
i say a prayer and i give thanks
that im alive and i am glad
that ive been given one more chance
my eyes are open now i see
the powers dwelling within me
ive done the deeds ive cleared my head
now i am clean back from the dead

chorus
whoa i rise above it all and im not coming down
whoa because a champion is what they call me now
and im not backing down i will stand my ground
whoa because a champion is what they call me now

verse 2
look how far ive come the wars that i have won
i think out loud victorious and proud
the years behind the tears i try to hide
this pain wont last time to remove this mask

my eyes are open now i see
the powers dwelling within me
ive done the deeds ive cleared my head
now i am clean back from the dead

chorus

verse 3
i got this new head on my shoulders and im looking for justice
so gladly seeking out bitches that decided to talk shit
you want conflict well i got it and i aint gonna stop
until i drop or take that motherfucking place on top
aint given it back when i take that place as a matter of fact lets cut to the chase
gonna take that spot on top of the list quick call it statutory rape
you want some beef better bring a fork cause im never gonna pass the torch
gonna keep going with the flows exposing you hoes to show you im more important
a little bit of dirt mixed with the mud a little bit of rock mixed with a thug
got a good heart inside my chest and a little bit of gangster in my blood
been to jail ive been to prison went to hell and had a vision
was presented with decision to change how i was living
gotta give it up gotta give it back ive had enough gotta get intact
as a matter of fact gotta get these kats in check and stack these fucking racks
gotta get that cheese gotta get that bread gotta get that dough gotta get ahead
gotta cut no slack to these motherfucking punks that held me down back from the dead go
breakdown
yeah

chorus
whoa i rise above it all and im not coming down
whoa because a champion is what they call me
whoa i rise above it all and im not coming down
whoa because a champion is what they call me now
and im not backing down i will stand my ground
whoa because a champion is what they call me a champion is what they call me now6embed"
