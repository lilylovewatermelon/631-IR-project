do you know whats worth fightin for
when its not worth dyin for
does it take your breath away
and you feel yourself suffocatin
does the pain weigh out the pride
and you look for a place to hide
did someone break your heart inside
youre in ruins

chorus
one twentyone guns
lay down your arms give up the fight
one twentyone guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i

verse 2
when youre at the end of the road
and you lost all sense of control
and your thoughts have taken their toll
when your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
your faith walks on broken glass
and the hangover doesnt pass
nothings ever built to last
youre in ruins

one twentyone guns
lay down your arms give up the fight
one twentyone guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i

bridge
did you try to live on your own
when you burned down the house and home
did you stand too close to the fire
like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

verse 3
when its time to live and let die
and you cant get another try
somethin inside this heart has died
youre in ruins

chorus
one twentyone guns
lay down your arms give up the fight
one twentyone guns
throw up your arms into the sky
one twentyone guns
lay down your arms give up the fight
one twentyone guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i91embed"
