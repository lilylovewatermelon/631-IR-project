if i could kill a word and watch it die
id poison never shoot goodbye
beat regret when i felt i had the nerve
yeah id pound fear to a pile of sand
choke lonely out with my bare hands
id hang hate so that it cant be heard
if i could only kill a word

verse 2
id take brokeness out back
and break heartbreak stand there and laugh
right in its face while shootin it the bird
id put upset down in its place
id squeeze the life out of disgrace
lay over under six cold feet of dirt
if i could only kill a word

chorus
give me sticks give me stones
bend my body break my bones
use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
cause you cant unhear you cant unsay
but if it were up to me to change
id turn lies and hate to love and truth
if i could only kill a word
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
id knock out temptations teeth
id sever evil let it bleed
then light up wicked stand and watch it burn
id take vice and id take vile
tie em up there with hostile
hang em high and leave em for the birds
if i could only kill a word

chorus
so give me sticks give me stones
bend my body break my bones
use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
cause you cant unhear you cant unsay
but if it were up to me to change
id turn lies and hate to love and truth
if i could only kill a word
if i could only kill a word6embed"
