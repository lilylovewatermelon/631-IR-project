very superstitious
writings on the wall
very superstitious
ladders bout to fall
thirteen month old baby
broke the looking glass
seven years of bad luck
the good things in your past

chorus
when you believe in things
that you dont understand
then you suffer
superstition aint the way yeah

verse 2
ooh very superstitious
wash your face and hands
rid me of the problem
do all that you can
keep me in a daydream
keep me going strong
you dont want to save me
sad is my song

when you believe in things
that you dont understand
then you suffer
superstition aint the way yeah

verse 3
very superstitious
nothing more to say
very superstitious
the devils on his way
thirteen month old baby
broke the looking glass
seven years of bad luck
good things in your past

chorus
when you believe in things
that you dont understand
then you suffer
superstition aint the way
