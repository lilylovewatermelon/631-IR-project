hello yeah

verse 1 kid cudi
uh little homie in the room
inin the room boy on the moon
hadhad nono one no one to hang out with
talk that shit to just my little homies
one year younger they aint get where i was going
took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely hmm
lonely in my room
ii mean me up on the moon
entertained myself laughed at myself
as i grew to be a teen i disguised myself
had the lowest selfesteem especially with the girls
tried every sport just to impress all the girls
instead of all the ladies cause they talked down
i was too artsy known to be a clown hmm
ahhuh and now my facebook poppin
cause i told the same girls i would be the hot shit
one day

chorus kid cudi  billy craven

yeah yeah uh big homie made the move
mademade the move flew off the moon
still had nono one no one to hang out with
talk that shit to just my brooklyn niggas
all i would wonder is when will my time come
had mad jobs and i lost damn near all of them
thinkin bout my bosses yep i hated all of them
studio at night had me hustlin to most of them
nigga i was late damn near every day
but ima be on time when my stars align
when my soul was happy on my ramen diet
followed by a loosey was the meal of grinders
if you knowin the truth all you think about is that thing
always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
until you meet a kid like ki
niggas thought i was crazy my mama know i stay high
we getting money mom

chorus kid cudi  billy craven
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world

and none of yall had a clue about me

and none of yall really knew about me
i was heavyheavyheavy on my grizzle
and none of yall really cared about me
and none of yall really cared about me
