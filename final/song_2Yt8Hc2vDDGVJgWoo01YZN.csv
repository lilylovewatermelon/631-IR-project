well grey clouds wrapped round the town like elastic
cars stood like toys made of taiwanese plastic
the boy laughed at the spastic
dancing around in the rain

while laundrettes cleaned clothes
high heels rubbed toes
puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
dressed in their suits and their boots
well they all looked the same

prechorus
i took myself down to the cafe to find all
the boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
and carved out a poem
above the urinal that read

chorus
dont you cry for the lost
smile for the living
get what you need and
give what youre given
lifes for the living so live it
or youre better off dead

while the evening pulled the moon out of its packet
stars shone like buttons on an old mans jacket
we needed a nail
but we tacked it til it fell off the wall

while pigeons pecked trains
sparks flew like planes
the rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
and we all had new iphones
but no one had no one to call

prechorus
and i stumbled down
to the stomach of the town
where the widow takes memories
to slowly drown
with a hand to the sky
and a mist in her eye she said

chorus
dont you cry for the lost
smile for the living
get what you need and
give what youre given
lifes for the living so live it
or youre better off dead
verse 3
well im sick of this town
this blind mans forage
they take your dreams down
and they stick em in storage
you can have em back son
when youve paid off your mortgage and loans

oh hell with this place
ill go it my own way
ill stick out my thumb
and i trudge down the highway
someday someone
must be going my way home

prechorus
til then ill make my bed
from a disused car
with a mattress of leaves
and a blanket of stars
and ill stitch the words into my heart
with a needle and thread

chorus
dont you cry for the lost
smile for the living
get what you need and
give what youre given
you know lifes for the living so live it
or youre better off dead
dont you cry for the lost
smile for the living
get what you need and
give what youre given
lifes for the living so live it
or youre better off dead4embed"
