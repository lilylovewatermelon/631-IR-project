while bullets shower the earth
we turn our heads and cover our faces
now flames devour the sky
and i hear these words in the back of my mind

chorus
here we stand at this fork in the road
weve got no time to waste oh which way shall we go
is the world spinning out of control
which way shall we go which way shall we go
i cant believe this it makes me sick

verse 2
fresh smell of death on your tongue
you bait the hook and here come the children
another grave stone to sell
while you get rich in the valley of hell

chorus
here we stand at this fork in the road
weve got no time to waste oh which way shall we go
is the world spinning out of control
which way shall we go which way shall we go
i cant believe this it makes me sick
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likeverse 3
the devils creeping hes got us eating from his dirty hands
we feast on lies which makes it hard for us to take a stand
out in the desert theres a forest full of fallen trees
its what they want but no its not what we need

verse 4
screaming at the ceiling doesnt make it better
slipped into a coma lost my favorite sweater
ask them no more questions youll never catch them lying
its time to make our move and strike them right between the eyes

chorus
here we stand at this fork in the road
weve got no time to waste oh which way shall we go
is the world spinning out of control
which way shall we go which way shall we go4embed"
