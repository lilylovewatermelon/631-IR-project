food and liquor stores rest on every corner
from 45th and state to the last standing henry horner
jjs harolds chicken good finger lickin
while they sin gin sin sin at rothschilds and kenwood liquors
the winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
searchin for the truth
they rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
they get high off that trunk bass and 2020 rims
they rock braids air force ones and timbs
they drink hennessy hypnotiq and 40s
they call they women hoes bust downs and shorties
they keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
prisons packed bubblin over in brown sugar
they keep empty westside lots crowded hypes powdered
the well is running dry
the days of malcolm and martin have ended
our hope has descended and off to the side
waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
but god has another solution that has evolved from the hood
i present one who turns the fiasco to good

lupe fiasco
auzu billahi min ash shaitani r rajimi
bismi llahi rrahmani rrahim
dedicated to my grandmother
peace and much love to you
