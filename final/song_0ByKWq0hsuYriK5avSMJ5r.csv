dont you know that ill be around to guide you
through your weakest moments to leave them behind you
returning nightmares only shadows

chorus
well cast some light and youll be alright
well cast some light and youll be alright for now

verse 2
crosses all over heavy on your shoulders
the sirens inside you waiting to step forward
disturbing silence darkens your sight

chorus
well cast some light and youll be alright
well cast some light and youll be alright for now

bridge
crosses all over the boulevard
crosses all over the boulevard
crosses all over the boulevard
crosses all over the boulevard
crosses all over the boulevard

verse 3
the streets outside your window overflooded
people staring they know youve been broken
repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces

ignore them tonight and youll be alright
well cast some light and youll be alright17embed"
