eighteen  thousandyearold soul
midwest shooting star
in the days she waits
but she moonlights rock n roll
playing a raindance with her guitar
sometimes you only get one chance

chorus
you got a look in your eyes your eyes
i knew you in a past life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops
ships pass in the night
i dont want to wait til the next life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops

verse 2
last call and everybodys watching
her voice rings out like a storm
sometimes the past echoes in the future
started long before we were born
sometimes you only get one chance

chorus
you got a look in your eyes your eyes
i knew you in a past life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops
ships pass in the night
i dont want to wait til the next life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops

universe wont wait for you
its do or die whatcha gongongonna do

chorus
you got a look in your eyes
i knew you in a past life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops
ships pass in the night
i dont want to wait til the next life
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops
one glance and the avalanche drops
one look and my heartbeat stops14embed"
