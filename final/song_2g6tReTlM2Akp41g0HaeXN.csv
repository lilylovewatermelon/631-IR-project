i pop the pain away i slide the pain away
i pop the pain away i slide the pain away
i picked you up when you
fell and cut your knee
told you not to cry and held you
close to me

chorus blxst
i hope im not too late
to set my demons straight
i know i made you wait
but how much can you take
i hope you see the god in me
i hope you can see
and if its up stay down for me
yeah

do you love me do you trust me
can i trust you dont judge me
ima die hard it gets ugly
too passionate it gets ugly
mmm ahah
i wonder where i lost my way
mmm ahah
been waiting on your call all day
tell me you in my corner right now
when i fall short im leanin on you to cry out
we all got enough to lie about
my truth too complicated to hide now
can i open up is it safe or not
im afraid a little you relate or not
have faith a little i might take my time
aint no savin face this time

chorus blxst
i hope im not too late
to set my demons straight
i know i made you wait
but how much can you take
i hope you see the god in me
i hope you can see
and if its up stay down for me
yeah

verse 2 kendrick lamar
i got some regrets
iiiiiii
but my past wont keep me from my best
iiiiiii
subtle mistakes felt like life or death
iiiiiii
i wanna see the family stronger
i wanna see the money longer
you know that id die for you
i get emotional about life
the lost ones keepin me up at night
the world be reminding me its danger
ill still risk it all for a stranger
if i told you who i am would you use it against me
right or wrong no stone just love to send me
chorus blxst
i hope im not too late
to set my demons straight
i know i made you wait
but how much can you take
i hope you see the god in me
i hope you can see
and if its up stay down for me
yeah

outro blxst
baby you make me
pray for london
yeah
cause if i won it all without you involved
fucking love you
i guess its all for nothing48embed"
