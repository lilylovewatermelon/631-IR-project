a click clacking my heart keeps making an ominous sound
that chain keeps dragging me up just to drop me back down
i think im over the hump enough to see the other side
thats when another thought of you runs through my mind

since you had to go ive been on a roller coaster ride
up and down i go over you then about to lose my mind
its out of control round and round
upside down and down upside
since you had to go ive been on a roller coaster ride

psychedelic trip my stomach flips again and again
id love to get my ticket back but im locked in
a white knuckle grip hanging onto whats left of my life
i hate to think about to coming down when im up this high

since you had to go ive been on a roller coaster ride
up and down i go over you then about to lose my mind
pain points his gun and i hold my hands up high
off the edge i go on this roller coaster ride

since you had to go ive been on a roller coaster ride
up and down i go over you then about to lose my mind

its out of control round and round
upside down and down upside
since you had to go ive been on a roller coaster ridesee eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also like1embed"
