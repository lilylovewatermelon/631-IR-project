well thank god for the shooter hmm
and thank god for the leader hmm
and think hard for a message
blink art on pedestrians what are you a believer
were tranquil for a brutus hey
and hard road for a caesar hey
well who came from the heavens
they kill for a blessin they gon do it to jesus hm
and thank god for the shooters

verse 1
them hard streets make a militant man
fuck a bitch be as real as you can
our education they tend to say we killers again
but id rather give this living a chance im getting patience
i wonder if the world is gon see us as just niggas
they treat lyrics like i hold triggers like i make difference
then downplay what im given like im no different
it make me wanna move to my aunts house
ive been on pills since a little one
start with advil then we level up
i wonder if my son gon trust me after songs so ugly
bout his moms aint mean to see the world so crummy
they gottec9s for jesus
so i figured that the second coming wasnt never coming
go figure heaven is a hassle cause
they dont even want a nigga back in africa

verse 2
and some of us fall and some of us hover
and some of us shooters and some of us lovers
i see the sum of it all im running for cover
invite you for supper but really they hunt you
whats really 300 whos really a gangster
whos really the prey whos really in danger
im willing to pray im feeling the angels
is liquor the savior this moment will contain us
and ride to the far side im looking for peace
just spread the cigar wide a moment of ease
hard benches for my brothers that be roaming the streets
we dont always be the leaders that they want us to be
im just hoping that she praying while she down on her knees
see i often treat these hoes like their fathers would be
good lord my flaws blind you got you time for my flaws
chorus
well thank god for the shooter hmm
and thank god for the leader hmm
and think hard for a message

and hard road for a caesar hey
