take leave the conscious mind
found myself to be so inclined
why sleep in discontent
oh the price of companionship

chorus
my shadow runs with me
underneath the big wide sun
my shadow comes with me as we leave it all
we leave it all far behind

verse 2
ah empty pockets will
allow a greater sense of wealth
why contain yourself
like any other book on a shelf

chorus
my shadow lays with me
underneath the big wide sun
my shadow stays with me as we leave it all
we leave it all far behind

bridge
subtle voices in the wind
hear the truth theyre telling
a world begins where the road ends
watch me leave it all behind

far behind
far behindembed"
