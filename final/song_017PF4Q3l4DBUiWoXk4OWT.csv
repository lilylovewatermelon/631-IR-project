ive always been the one to say the first goodbye
had to love and lose a hundred million times
had to get it wrong to know just what i like
now im falling
you say my name like i have never heard before
im indecisive but this time i know for sure
i hope im not the only one that feels it all
are you falling

prechorus
centre of attention
you know you can get whatever you want from me
whenever you want it baby
its you in my reflection
im afraid of all the things it could do to me
if i wouldve known it baby

chorus
i wouldve stayed at home
cause i was doing better alone
but when you said hello
i knew that was the end of it all
i shouldve stayed at home
cause now there aint no letting you go
am i falling in love with the one that could break my heart
oh no i was doing better alone
but when you said hello
i knew that was the end of it all
i shouldve stayed at home
cause now there aint no letting you go
am i falling in love with the one that could break my heart

i wonder when you go if i stay on your mind

everyone before you was a waste of time
