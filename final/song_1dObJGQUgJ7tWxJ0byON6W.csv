verse 1
where were you when i said i loved you
and where were you when i cried at night
waitin up couldnt sleep without you
thinkin of all the times we shared

chorus
i remember when my heart broke
i remember when i gave up lovin you
my heart couldnt take no more of you
i was sad and lonely
i remember when i walked out
i remember when i screamed i hated you
but somehow deep inside still lovin you
sad and lonely

verse 2
no one knew all the pain i went through
all the love i saved deep in my heart for you
didnt know where i would go where i would be
but you made me leave
