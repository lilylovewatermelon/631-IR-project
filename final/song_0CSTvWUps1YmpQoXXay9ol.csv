a falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
i screamed aloud as it tore through them
and now its left me blind

chorus
the stars the moon they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn no day im always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart

verse 2
and in the dark i can hear your heartbeat
i tried to find the sound
but then it stopped and i was in the darkness
so darkness i became

chorus
the stars the moon they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn no day im always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart

bridge
i took the stars from our eyes and then i made a map
and knew that somehow i could find my way back
then i heard your heart beating you were in the darkness too
so i stayed in the darkness with you
