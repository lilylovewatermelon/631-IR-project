you’ll take advantage ’til you think you’re being used
cause without an enemy your anger gets confused
and i got stuck on a side you know i never chose
but it’s all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose

verse 2
there’s no escape for you except in someone else
although you’ve already disappeared within yourself
the invisible man who’s always changing clothes
it’s all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose

bridge
while i watch you making mistakes
i wish you luck i really do
with the problem with the puzzle
whatever’s left of you

verse 3
i heard you found another audience to bore
a creative thinker who imagined you were more
a new body for you to push around and pose
it’s all about taking the easy way out for you i suppose
it’s all about taking the easy way out for you i supposeyou might also like2embed"
