are you insane like me been in pain like me
bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me
just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me
would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me
are you high enough without the mary jane like me
do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me
do the people whisper bout you on the train like me
saying that you shouldnt waste your pretty face like me

chorus
and all the people say
you cant wake up this is not a dream
youre part of a machine you are not a human being
with your face all made up living on a screen
low on selfesteem so you run on gasoline

postchorus
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh
i think theres a flaw in my code
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh
these voices wont leave me alone
well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

verse 2
are you deranged like me are you strange like me
lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me
do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me
pointing fingers cause youll never take the blame like me
you might also likechorus
and all the people say
you cant wake up this is not a dream
youre part of a machine you are not a human being
with your face all made up living on a screen
low on selfesteem so you run on gasoline

postchorus
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh
i think theres a flaw in my code
oh ooh oh ooh oh oh
these voices wont leave me alone
well my heart is gold and my hands are cold124embed"
