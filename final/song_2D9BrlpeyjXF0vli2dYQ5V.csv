i try to face the fight within
but its over
im ready for the riot to begin
and surrender
i walked the path that led me to the end
remember
im caught beneath with nothing left to give forever

chorus
when angels fall with broken wings
i cant give up i cant give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
ill carry you and we will live forever
forever

verse 2
gray skies will chase the light away
no longer
i fought the fight now only dark remains
forever
divided i will stand
and i will let this end

chorus
when angels fall with broken wings
i cant give up i cant give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
ill carry you and we will live forever
forever

the sun begins to rise
and wash away the sky
the turning of the tide
dont leave it all behind
and i will never say goodbye

chorus
when angels fall with broken wings
i cant give up i cant give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
ill carry you and we will live forever

outro
