mama papa forgive me

verse 1
out of sight
out of mind
out of time
to decide
do we run
should i hide
for the rest
of my life
can we fly
do i stay
we could lose
we could fail
in the moment
it takes
to make plans
or mistakes

chorus
30 minutes a blink of an eye
30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide
30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide

carousels
in the sky
that we shape
with our eyes
under shade
silhouettes
casting shade
crying rain
can we fly
do i stay
we could lose
we could fail
either way
options change
chances fail
trains derail

chorus
30 minutes a blink of an eye
30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide
30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide
to decide
to decide to decide to decide
outro
to decide
to decide
to decide
to decide
to decide
