come on uh

verse 1
see me ride across the country with my shotty riding shotgun
got slimmys on my jimmy with magnums rocking platinum
wigs dig this the fucking police know i see them
so im headed up to reno like a geo and ill greet em
free my mind of lifes inconsistencies
you got a lot but you you cant get these
free my mind of lifes inconcistencies
i had enough and you can swing on these

chorus
because im a dog baby see me ride across the country
im a dog bitch big suitcase full of money
im a dog mamma and im rolling el camino
im a ddddog yeah

verse 2
droptop continental with a suicide see me ride
you by my side big girl yo we will never die
ill be your hollywood eyes and send you swinging baby
bring it home to poppa and rock going to make it jingle baby
its a god damn shame people they look at me
but i know in the end you give a fuck about me

and smoking grass leaving all my cash for my little boy
