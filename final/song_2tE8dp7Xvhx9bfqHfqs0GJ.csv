verse 1
if i could
i would dare
feed your dreams
and starve your fears
if i could
light the world
we could sit
and watch it burn
we could fall asleep inside the glow

chorus
so tell me what i got to do to win you over
youll never have to wonder if you need another
youll never have to wonder if i understand
and every time you reach for me youll find a hand out
oh

verse 2
if i could
take you in
feeling you deep
beneath my skin
then i could
slip away
with you as a poison in my veins
i dont want to fall asleep alone
and wake up knowin that i died without the one
