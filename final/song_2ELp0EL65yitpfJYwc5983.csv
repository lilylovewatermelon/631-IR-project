verse 1 lil baby
im doin donuts in my neighborhood it made me feel good
i swore i would never do that shit again but still do it
i feel better with no ig but im too big of influence
and live your life dont try to make someone else have that shit might ruin you
yeah i make money off all type of shit i got stocks for me and my children
had to put the wide body on the lamb truck it look sexy call it mrs urus
fucked up playin around now im serious
i got two hundred bands in each ear
i was damn near the man beforе i started rappin
these othеr niggas just cappin
i can take the top off while the car goin
call it gettin nasty in traffic
i done reached another bracket eight figure taxes
i cant touch a bitch if she average
any location play we gettin at em
all this shit come and go it dont matter
these boys subtweetin when you aint at em
we dont even social beef we get active
everybody killin now til somethin happen
i feel uncomfortable without a ratchet
i might shoot my shot at what you call it
im forever ballin i might eat her pussy good and never call her
i been runnin from her i heard you a stalker
but we is not the same lil nigga
i been drugged through the mud had a girl for the plug
i put numbers on the board this is not for no awards
i get money thats enough
if i get em thats a plus
handle business is a must
get hurt feelings when you trust
