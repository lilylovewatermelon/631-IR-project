caller 1 what im going to say is probably going to be pretty upsetting to both of you gentlemen but im going to be as straight forward as i can and i dont want to be cut off while im saying it too heterosexuals we get married because our marriage is sealed by god we follow the letter of the law now were not perfect but we do now youre saying we follow the god of who not just any god not just any pagan god the god of abraham isaac and jacob the same ones that the muslims i mean you know they claim its the same and the jews  and thats why same sex marriage is an issue
andrew sullivan i would just point out to you that you have every right to do that but we do not live in a theocratic state there is a separation between church and state for example it is against clearly absolutely clearly the rules of abraham and indeed of christianity that you can divorce it is forbidden but as citizens in a civil society you have a right to a civil divorce this is a society based on a separation of church and state you are absolutely and i would defend your right to exclude homosexuals from marriage in your congregations or whenever you would see fit  although i would disagree with you but as a matter of civil rights and of the state and of a secular society apart from the church youre wrong its a civil right and it needs to be defended

caller 1 well then let me defend my case then

andrew sullivan okay you go ahead

caller 1 well there really isnt a separation between the church and the state there is technically but not really and i have another question for you what if a man says that he was very attracted to a beast and he decided that he was born by nature to be with that beast be it a dog or be it whatever and he just decides he wants to marry it i mean how far in society are we going to go

andrew sullivan im sorry but i find the equation of a human being to a beast of homosexuals to animals to be something that i am actually beneath answering

christopher hitchens it seemed to me that when you said that separation of church and state was technical only rather than actual that you had to be describing the constitution as a technicality in that instance which i hope would be for most listeners well most viewers rather a sufficient rebuttal the constitution states very explicitly that the government cannot concern itself with the business of religion this doesnt mean that religious people cant concern themselves with the business of government no one intends it to mean that andrew and i have probably our biggest disagreement on this very point  he regards himself as in some way created and supervised by a supreme being i cant think how anyone peoples such a they also think its a very horrible idea the idea of cradle to grave invigilation not only does it stop at the grave according to people like andrew i think its a really frightening and nauseating wish to be a slave fortunately theres absolutely no reason to believe that theres any evidence for it at all

brian lamb tennessee youre on go ahead

caller 2 oh good morning brian christopher and andrew how are you today

brian lamb good

caller 2 i was very taken aback by the rude statement from the previous caller who evidently thinks theyre christian because they can be rude but we christians cant be rude and i was very taken aback because of what she was saying was actually stemming from what happened in the garden of eden and adam and eve were expelled from the garden of eden and that was after this fall of mankind you know sin entered the world and people forgot who god was and wanted to go the wrong way from that wanting to go the wrong way has stemmed a perversity of marriage that was ordained by god in the garden of eden between man and one woman one man one woman everything has stemmed from that well the previous caller which is a far extreme into bestiality that is so abhorrent to god as is anything that is of his divine nature

brian lamb thanks caller lets talk with christopher hitchens on this whatre you thinking
christopher hitchens i was thinking about the talking snake and the garden of eden and all these sinister fairy tales i mean the caller sounds so sweet i almost didnt want to say what i think about the horror of these beliefs

brian lamb you do not believe any of this

christopher hitchens i think it is a very nasty fairytale and im very relieved that its not true

brian lamb are you an atheist

christopher hitchens im an antitheist in other words its not that i dont believe that there is a god i think that the discovery there isnt is a huge relief because it would be like living in a celestial north korea if there was one you would never be able to escape this attention it would be even worse if it was benign as some people claim it to be i think its a horrible idea i think it comes from the slave element within us the wish to be looked after and protected and in some sense owned which i repudiate with every fibre of myself

andrew sullivan well christopher

christopher hitchens thats what i really believe if you want ill tell you what i really think about religion thats the base of it

andrew sullivan we can come together on the constitution we can both exist in this republic as civil people but i must say that the notion that belief in god and love of christ is some sort of permanent slavery that ones lives ones life controlled and unable to have freedom to me at least as someone who is a believer is a misdescription of the way it is in fact it is a form of liberation without it i know i couldnt have gotten through whatever life has thrown my way and i also know in my heart of hearts that my being gay is something also that god loves and wants me to bring to its best fruition but like straight people or gay people we can all sin we can all go away from god but for me christianity is not slavery its liberation and the ability to have some perspective on the world some place to go where this worlds daily pressures does not get you and cannot get you is an incredibly liberating and important experience and so many people have it and i am very glad that god is an ear

christopher hitchens see all thats supposed to sound and does in a way modest and humble and so forth but think of all the incredibly solipsistic and arrogant claim it really is you claim to know what god wants

andrew sullivan no i dont

christopher hitchens you claim to think he has a plan for you

andrew sullivan no i do think that but i dont know what it is

christopher hitchens unbelievable conceit of the supposedly humble and meek heres why i think its authoritarian im told there was a human sacrifice that took place 2000 years or so ago in which i had no say which would not have taken place if id have had anything to do with it but which has saved me whether i want to be saved or not i dont like to be talked to in that tone of voice
andrew sullivan well then youre talking about a certain kind of

christopher hitchens i really dont when it isnt sickly its rather authoritarian that kind of talk and you managed to do in your own question is a tiny element of ease

brian lamb tulsa oklahoma the democrat line

caller 3 hey i may be correct me if im not mistaken you said that youre gay

andrew sullivan that i am yes

caller 3 okay so thats homosexual

andrew sullivan yes

caller 3 okay and you said that youre a christian also

andrew sullivan i did

caller 3 okay well theres a letter that was written to the church that was in rome a long time ago in the new testament and it speaks of a if you dont mind ill just quote it says the wrath of god is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness since what may be known about god has plagued them because gods made it plain to them and have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made it says right here that it says although they knew god they didnt glorify him as god or give him thanks but their thinking became pure and their foolish heart was darkened and my point is coming up although claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immoral god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles okay it says so therefore god gave them over the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator romans 11832 niv

brian lamb thanks caller

christopher hitchens i was about to say how much more of that were you going to take

andrew sullivan hes citing i think hes citing romans which and hes leading up to the condemnation of homosexuality or at least what st paul seemed to think was homosexuality let me say i will leave your conscience to you and your god and maybe you will leave me and my conscience to me and mine more broadly speaking there is enormous bunches of things in the gospels and not in the gospels but in the bible and the old testament which are clearly forbidden for example all sorts of kosher regulations not many christians contemporarily follow those kosher regulations in fact the bible says that if you are gay you should be stoned to death this is a practice that is upheld in many parts of the world what i would ask of any christian fundamentalist who believes in this
christopher hitchens do you believe that this book is the work of god

andrew sullivan i believe that its inspired by the word of god

christopher hitchens well then i leave you with it

andrew sullivan ive lived with it my entire life christopher youre welcome

christopher hitchens but you just said to this guy you can have your god and i can have mine

andrew sullivan no i did not

christopher hitchens why yes you did

andrew sullivan no i did not i said you cant

christopher hitchens its the word of god or its not surely

andrew sullivan there are many many themes in christian belief and one of them only one of them is a fundamentalist one in which every single word of the bible is absolutely literally true i dont happen to hold that particular view im a catholic i believe the bible has to be interpreted through ones own experience ones own faith experience through tradition of the church and the scriptures

christopher hitchens tradition of the church is to say that something thats essential to your nature is a filthy sin

andrew sullivan no it isnt let me just correct you on that because its very important the teaching of the church to which on this matter is not a sin

christopher hitchens the teaching of the nonpaedophile wing of that church

andrew sullivan you can leave your anticatholic slurs elsewhere

christopher hitchens its not anticatholic

andrew sullivan the point im not defending those people either the church officially says that being gay is not a sin only acting upon it in a sexual matter is regarded as sinful this

christopher hitchens its a way of saying hate the sin and love the sinner theyre talking about your nature

andrew sullivan i think it is when you actually reflect upon it and read it and think about it in coherent my book virtually normal has a whole chapter dealing on this issue

brian lamb let me share with you also an email

christopher hitchens good book by the way

andrew sullivan thank you christopher

brian lamb  from joyce boyes congratulations you really have two of the lowest journalist to grace your stage todayseems easy for you to cater to that thinking so frequently any more i just cant gush how wonderful cspan is j montgomery says i am deeply disappointed in you andrew sullivan and christopher hitchens they are like two peas on the same pod theres not a dimes worth of difference between the two of them they are both right wing extremists andrew sullivan is the worst of the worst and hitchens is not far behind i stopped my subscription to the nation magazine because of hitchens

christopher hitchens right we can take that as a comment

brian lamb swansea south carolina youre next

caller 4 well good morning complaintspan id like to say this to mr hitchens maybe he can if you want to know why the lefts receding faster than his hairline then all you have to do is listen to what he said about religion hes unwilling for people to live under the tyrannies of their own conscience which is basically what religion is but hed be perfectly happy for us to all live under the tyranny of a thousand or a million socialist bureaucrats all you have to do is examine the intellectual dishonesty of that to see where hes coming from

christopher hitchens i can listen to this guy all day

andrew sullivan if receding hairline is a function is a sign of ones intellectual decrepitude then im really in trouble

christopher hitchens how do you know where my hairline was before by the way

brian lamb i dont know if you heard him but he slipped in an interesting

christopher hitchens interesting though is how very often the loving christian types begin with a nasty adhominem remark and they go on of course to get stupider and stupider the idea of living under the tyranny of your own conscience is not what religion says at all religion says you have to live under a code transmitted through holy books and divine warrant and so on those of us who live with the tyranny only of our own conscience and belief that an ethical life can be lived without reference to the supernatural are called humanists  or atheists or in my case antitheists you have it precisely wrong sir but then so you would

brian lamb did you hear him slip in complaintspan

christopher hitchens i did i thought that was sweet4embed"
