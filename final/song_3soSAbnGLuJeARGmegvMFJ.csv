one day ill change my ways
till then im stuck in this space
shut down and hiding my face
tuned out and losing my faith

prechorus
stand up tired of being the victim
you only on the outs if you with them
only hurts if you give em credence ah
give em reasons ah
theyre not better than you
theyre just a figment of imagination

chorus
there are times when i dont like myself
i believe all the things that they say about me bout me
i wanna love myself just likе everyone еlse
but there are times when i dont like myself
