verse 1
i thought we had something special
and we had something good
but i shoulda had
another mechanic under my hood
if you see me walking by ya
boy dont you even speak
pretend you on the sofa
and im on the tv
might see me on a poster
see me at a show
but you wont see me for free
boy this aint no promo

wherever you be layin
you can stay now
gotta board the bbj
and pull the shades down
im on the plane now
