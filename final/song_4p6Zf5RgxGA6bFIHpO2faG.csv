and she left for the city
on the 18th train
and i still cant believe it

man i dont know how we could let this happen

she slammed the door
and she gave me the finger
ill be back so fast
i still cant remember
you can read it yourself
its all in the letter

ill sit around
you get yourself a new life
go get your spark
go find your smile
and get happy
