in your justice and your mercy
heaven walked the broken road
here to fight this sinners battle
here to make my fall your own

prechorus
turn my eyes to see your face
as all my fears surrender
hold my heart within this grace
where burden turns to wonder

chorus 1
and i will fight to follow
and i will fight for love
throw my life forever
to the triumph of the son

verse 2
let your love be my companion
in the war against my pride
long to break all vain obsession
till youre all that i desire

prechorus
turn my eyes to see your face
as all my fears surrender
hold my heart within this grace
where burden turns to wonder

you came and died but the grave was borrowed

so i can stand with a life to follow
in the light of your name
