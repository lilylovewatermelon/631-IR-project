dirty tissues trust issues
glasses on the sink they didnt fix you
lonely pillows in a strangers bed
little voices in my head
secret keeping stop the bleeding
lost a little weight because i wasnt eating
all the songs that i cant listen to to tell the truth

chorus 1
loving you was young and wild and free
loving you was cool and hot and sweet
loving you was sunshine safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

verse 2
hesitation awkward conversation
running on low expectation
every siren that i was ignoring
im paying for it

chorus 1
loving you was young and wild and free
loving you was cool and hot and sweet
loving you was sunshine safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

chorus 2
loving you was dumb dark and cheap
loving you will still take shots at me
found loving you was sunshine but then it poured
and i lost so much more than my senses
cause loving you had consequences

outro
yeah loving you117embed"
