what’ll it be now mr mole
whispers sloth in curls of smoke
take a back seat or play pharaoh
dance with me and shake your bones

chorus
slow down it’s a science
he’s been waiting to bring you down
snake eyed with a sly smile
he can hold you and shake you child

verse 2
leopards laze each on plush pillows
slender capes of red and chrome
paperback dreams in their deep doze
twitch their toes to black mambo

chorus
slow down it’s a science
he’s been waiting to bring you down
snake eyed with a sly smile
he can hold you and shake you child

verse 3
wanna play cheat now says the sloth
a domino flush to his nose
tickle that cheek and take your throne
pump your veins with gushing gold

slow down it’s a science
he’s been waiting to bring you down
snake eyed with a sly smile
he can hold you and shake you child

outro
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you
we can hold you29embed"
