oh my god just take the firearm from me
holy fuck i understand that im too weak
oh my god just shut me up for heaven’s sake
so i load one round im scared to die while i’m awake
so i close my eyes and wait for a miracle
and everything done for the dead after theyre dead is for the living
and everything done on a day goddamn it thats our decision
i kept my eyes closed it was easy now i see it with perfect vision
and everything done for the dead after theyre dead is for the living
fuck me up fuck it get fucked up hey
fuck me up yeah and stay fucked up
