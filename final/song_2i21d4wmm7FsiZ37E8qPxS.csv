still remember that crackle that needed laying down
stain of the glass in the chapel as we laid him in the ground
and feet start shufflin
honey mine start runnin
yeah i run that mississippi till my feet in tennessee ground
just like he told me

chorus
never pray for change
that old memphis rain

verse 2
now my nightmares  108
been keeping me awake
never knew what the blues could do to a boy that was giving everything it takes
now the cadillacs hummin and my heart starts bumbin
and there aint no doubt that theres no way out from everything ive ever wanted
the pills and the pain

chorus
never pray for change
that od memphis rain

interlude
and its gold
i cant roll that its mine
dont mistake what it takes to lose sight of the line
cause in time you will find if you do

well they burned down big hill
and they marched away
i can still see that old aframe kickin back off of that big lake
i still go there
to the middle of nowhere
its a lifetime meant to me
gotta build it up to what it otta be
just like he told me

chorus
never pray for change
that old memphis rainembed"
