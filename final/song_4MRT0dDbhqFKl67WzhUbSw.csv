riring finger where the rock is
thethese hoes couldnt test me
even if their name was pop quiz

mamamad bitches we dont fuck with
i dont fuck with them chickens
unless they last name is cutlet
let it soak in
like seasoning
and tell them bitches blow me

verse 2 drake
i never fucked nicki cause she got a man
but when thats over then im first in line
and the other day in her maybach
i thought goddamn this is the perfect time
we had just come from that video

she was sittin down on that big butt
but i was still starin at the titties though
yeah lowkey or maybe highkey
i been peeped that you like me you know

i mean it doesnt take much for us to do this shit quietly
i mean she say im obsessed with thick women and i agree
yeah thats right i like my girls bbw

verse 3 lil wayne
i never fucked nick and thats fucked up

whoever is hittin aint hittin it right
cause she act like she need dick in her life
thats another story im no storyteller
i piss greatness like goldish yellow
all my goons so overzealous
im from hollygrove the holy mecca
calendar say i got money for days
i squirm and i shake but im stuck in my ways
my girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
they bet not fuck with her surfboard surfboard
my eyes are so bright i take cover for shade
dont have my money take mothers instead
you got the hiccups you swallowed the truth
then i make you burp boy treat beef like sirloin
im talkin bout runnin in houses with army guns
so think about your son and daughter rooms
got two hoes with me masked up they got smaller guns
aint thinkin bout your son and daughter rooms
this shit is crazy my nigga
i mean brazy my nigga
that money talk i just rephrase it my nigga
blood gang take the b off behavior my nigga
for reals if you mouth off i blow your face off
i mean poppoppop then i take off
nigga now you see me nigga now you dont
like jamie foxx actin like ray charles
sixteen in a clip one in the chamber
17 ward bully with seventeen bullets
my story is how i went from poor me
to please pour me a drink and celebrate with me
