let me tell you what i do when my day is over
after picking the right clothes for about an hour
oooh im turning orange from all the carats around my neck
tonight im takin out the bling and im dressed to impress
im gettin ready for my night out on the town
im lookin hot cause you know we are holdin it down
rockin high tops and sayin no to stilettos
cause i might get drunk off my ass and i dont wanna fall
out on the streets all the taxis are showin me love
cause im shinin like a princess in the middle of thugs
and at the club the bouncers recognize my face
so while you waitin in the line we just enter the place

chorus
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly
you with me so its alright
we gonna stay up the whole night
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly

verse 2
im callin all my ladies at the table three
throwin back a couple bottles and the tabs on me
having some big ones then we startin to get crazy
table dancin smashin glasses it starts to get naughty
now we all ready to head out of the vip
im lookin good and i can feel that all eyes are on me
its time to show how em how we do on the floor
so while the dj play my track i want my girls on the floor
now you know i made an anthem for all my hot chicks
and nah it aint about how we girls are raisin your dicks
i got the surround sound so why ya wanna see me fall
im just tryin to have a blast and i aint takin your call
see justice liveget tickets as low as 93you might also likechorus
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly
you with me so its alright
we gonna stay up the whole night
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly

verse 3
now all the flyest ladies are on my team
and we know how to make that nice hot fucking scream
were getting ugly in the club we look a little trashed
but all the ballers in the club know we got that class
im bringing over this crew at the after party
just got into the hotel room and this is gettin started
better wake the fuck up cause were not here to sleep
uffie is hyped up in this bitch and im bangin that beat
now you and you come all lets take it to the next level
lets all go to the hotel pool as we finish the bottle
maybe kiss and dont tell its the rule around here
you must have me under a spell i lose control when youre near

chorus
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly
you with me so its alright
we gonna stay up the whole night
lets get this party started right
lets get drunk and freaky fly1embed"
