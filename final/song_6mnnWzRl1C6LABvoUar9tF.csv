verse
walked by so fly i made sure i took my time
tell me did you notice
hoping youll remember me
we met in a fantasy
tell me did you notice–

that im a little bit curious bout the way you feel
and ive never been scared to keep it real
how could you blame me
im just living on instinct thats the way i feel
and i want you to know you got that thrill that i like
i want that jungle kind of love
