i am a plastic man
wish i could be the one you could be proud of
im losing heart again
wish i could show you what you think im made of

chorus
someday i know ill find my place
someday i know this pain will fade

verse 2
i am a perfect sell
just wrap me up with a bow and flowers
i will neglect to tell
ill sell your story that we love each other

chorus
someday i know ill find my place
someday i know this pain will fade
someday i know ill find my place
someday ill sing my last refrain

bridge
why dont you let me be
and ill pretend im well
cause youre too blind to see
and im too tired to tell
and in your apathy
your head begins to swell
another tragedy
that youre too cold to feel

someday i know this pain will fade
someday i know ill find my place
someday ill sing my last refrain1embed"
