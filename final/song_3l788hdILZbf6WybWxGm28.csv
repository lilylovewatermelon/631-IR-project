help me i dont know what im doing
help me before i fall to ruin
and if im blind i will lead you on
come follow me now before our time is gone

chorus
and as youre laughing at this fool tonight
let me rid myself of any line that i might choose to trip you up
and as im howling at the moonlight dont you kid yourself
i will be your luck and never be your curse never be your curse

verse 2
help me i dont know what im saying
sometimes this tongue can be betraying
and if im wrong is that such a crime
and if you want you can set my words to right

chorus
and as youre laughing at this fool tonight
let me rid myself of any line that i might choose to trip you up
and as im howling at the moonlight dont you kid yourself
i will be your luck and never be your curse never be your curse

verse 3
and if your eyes forget to well
and if your lies forget to tell
and if our paths forget to cross
it doesnt mean youre lost

and as youre laughing at this fool tonight
let me rid myself of any line that i might choose to trip you up
and as im howling at the moonlight dont you kid yourself
i will be your luck and never be your curse never be your curse
and as youre laughing at this fool tonight
let me rid myself of any line that i might choose to trip you up
and as im howling at the moonlight dont you kid yourself
i will be your luck and never be your curse never be your curseembed"
