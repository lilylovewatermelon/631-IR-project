i was fifteen she was eighteen
the prettiest thing id ever seen in my life
i loved her at first sight
i found her in marietta a town north of atlanta
i brought her home to see my folks
they loved her too
we were together for a long time
thought it would be for all time
but things change and rearrange
she had to go
she left me crying in 79
an airline pilot in carolina
i was a wreck cant drive a check
it broke my heart

chorus
my first love was an older woman
theres been many since
but therell never be another
built in 1955 snowshoe white overdrive
i never shouldve sold her ill always love her
she was mine

verse 2
years went by teardrops dried
i got her back i was surprised
in 93 a gift to me on christmas eve
we were both older so i restored her
couldve sold her for a lot more
but i will never shes mine forever
until i go
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
my first love was an older woman
theres been many since
but therell never be another
built in 1955 snowshoe white overdrive
i never shouldve sold her ill always love her
she was mine

outro
ill never sell her shes mine forever
i love her soembed"
