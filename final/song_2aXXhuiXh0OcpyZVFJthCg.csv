youll never walk on the ceiling
if youve never been flat on the floor
and you cant soak up the sun
if youve never been stuck in the storm
you cant find somebody
if you never let somebody else go
if you aint hit a wall youll never find a window

chorus
you can never go up
if you never been down down down
