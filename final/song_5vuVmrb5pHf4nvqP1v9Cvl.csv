welcome to our neck of the forest

its 105 and muggy skin scorches in the heat its
chiggers and gnats and helicopter size mosquitoes

we got a deep seeded respect for those that fought to keep our freedom
we support our folks so im burnin with colt ford bubba and demun

verse 3 rooster  uncle snap
slap stompin through the country in my red wing boots
i raised up in the south where i planted my roots
you know i got to throw it up for people in the back wood
tailgate down ridin high like a lac should
no one ever liked a city slicker with a fat mouth
bring it round here bet youll get your ass knocked out
down home boys on this song to make you feel fine
cant tell play some hickhop for me one time
ol colt called me up said he needed some help
i filled my cup in the trunk now im flyin like hell
i aint ever been rehearsed i dont need no recital
this is real country talk this aint american idol
i made the noise for my boys they workin so hard
the rednecks checks to checks and the trailer parks
hickhop and body rock and put it up on the wall
country folks world wide now this all for yall
chorus danny boone
this is our song everybody sing it
clap your hands yall and do it like you mean it
we stand our ground and we dont back down
if youre from a small town and youre never gonna leave it

clap your hands yall and do it like you mean it
we stand our ground and we dont back down
and if you dont like it then dont come around

verse 4 colt ford
well looky right here its like a family reunion
everybody gather round and take communion
colt and bubba k like snow man and bandit
damnit they cant stand it just how we planned it
lord let the water wash away our sins
thank you for danny demun the lacs and good friends
cause folks from the country aint afraid of jack
we drink him and jim and all of that hymn
amazing grace how sweet the sound
and if you get in my face im a tear of the place
and leave you layin in the southern ground
sing it danny

chorus danny boone
this is our song everybody sing it
clap your hands yall and do it like you mean it
we stand our ground and we dont back down
if youre from a small town and youre never gonna leave it
this is our song everybody sing it
clap your hands yall and do it like you mean it
we stand our ground and we dont back down
and if you dont like it then dont come around
verse 5 demun jones
its about baggy jeans buckled and georgia boots
these mud bog tires chrome 22s
cause we country folks raised on breakin blocks
always got something with the clip in the glove box
the rifles tucked behind the rear seat
if you see a buck duck my wife cooks the deer meat
its a spectacle you should really come see this
