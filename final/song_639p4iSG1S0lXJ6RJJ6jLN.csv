i liked you
you showed me
these calls must continue

verse 1
time is collapsing in my head
i built all the walls you cant come in
you were the one that called me last
i highly doubt this thing will last

chorus
sticks and stones they hurt
when you shoot them through the phone
and you dragged my name through dirt
and it hurts to be left here alone

verse 2
elegant thoughts i will not share
my symphonic silence
i hope you can bare it baby
i liked you
you showed me
exactly who i dont wanna be

chorus
sticks and stones they hurt
when you shoot them through the phone
and you dragged my name through dirt
and it hurts to be left here alone
see alien ant farm liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeill always look for you
ill always look for you
ill always look for you you

you were the one that called me last
i highly doubt this thing will last
cause you were the one that messed up

chorus
sticks and stones they hurt
when you shoot them through the phone
and you dragged my name through dirt
and it hurts to be left here alone

sticks and stones get shot through the telephone
with instant results were both left alone
