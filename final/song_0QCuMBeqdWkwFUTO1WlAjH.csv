do you want to go to the seaside
im not trying to say that everybody wants to go
i fell in love at the seaside
i handled my charm with time and sleight of hand
do you want to go to the seaside
im not trying to say that everybody wants to go
i fell in love at the seaside
she handled her charm with time and sleight of hand and oh

bridge
but im just trying to love you any kind of way
but i find it hard to love you girl when youre far away
away

verse 2
do you want to go to the seaside
im not trying to say that everybody wants to go
but i found love on the seaside
