destroy
ah

verse 1
too tragic to stay with you
too static to try for you
these scars they swallow hard
the part of the past thats hollow and dark
too horrid to kill for you
too sordid to die with you
unstable as always come down
everything else is just dust and sound

chorus
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
see the shape broken and thrown away

verse 2
id give it all away
come take it all away
you cant resent the fear
somebody tell me how i got here
id give it all to you
come take it its all for you
the noise is so damn loud but
everything else is just dust and sound

separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
see the shape broken and thrown away

bridge
i dont wanna do this anymore
everythings shit everythings been taken forsaken
gotta start it over cause im hearing it backwards
dont make sense dont feel better
whos better its not that simple
you gotta figure it out before you make things difficult
its not a word its a problem the problem was easy
draw your conclusions solutions
anybody else wanna run
contorting distorting i am undone
one less propaganda nightmare fixture
are you getting the picture

chorus
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
see the shape broken and thrown away
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
separate ive lost my only way
see the shape broken and thrown away
outro
im broken and thrown away
