adieu adieu my native shore
fades oer the waters blue
the nightwinds sigh the breakers roar
and shrieks the wild seamew
yon sun that sets upon the sea
we follow in his flight
farewell awhile to him and thee
my native land—good night

a few short hours and he will rise
to give the morrow birth
and i shall hail the main and skies
but not my mother earth
deserted is my own good hall
its hearth is desolate
wild weeds are gathering on the wall
my dog howls at the gate

come hither hither my little page36
why dost thou weep and wail27
or dost thou dread the billows rage
or tremble at the gale
but dash the teardrop from thine eye
our ship is swift and strong
our fleetest falcon scarce can flyaj
more merrily alongak
let winds be shrill let waves roll highal
i fear not wave nor wind
yet marvel not sir childe that i
am sorrowful in mind37
for i have from my father gone
a mother whom i love
and have no friend save these alone
but thee—and one above
28

my father blessed me fervently
yet did not much complain
but sorely will my mother sigh
till i come back again—
enough enough my little lad
such tears become thine eye
if i thy guileless bosom had
mine own would not be dry

come hither hither my staunch yeoman38
why dost thou look so pale
or dost thou dread a french foeman
or shiver at the gale—
deemst thou i tremble for my life
sir childe im not so weak
but thinking on an absent wife
will blanch a faithful cheek
my spouse and boys dwell near thy hall
along the bordering lake29
and when they on their father call
what answer shall she make—
enough enough my yeoman goodam
thy grief let none gainsay
but i who am of lighter mood
will laugh to flee away

for who would trust the seeming sighsan
of wife or paramour
fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
we late saw streaming oer
for pleasures past i do not grieve
nor perils gathering near
my greatest grief is that i leave
no thing that claims a tear39
30

and now im in the world alone
upon the wide wide sea
but why should i for others groan
when none will sigh for me
perchance my dog will whine in vain
till fed by stranger hands
but long ere i come back again
hed tear me where he standsao40
31
with thee my bark ill swiftly go
athwart the foaming brine
nor care what land thou bearst me to
so not again to mine
welcome welcome ye darkblue waves
and when you fail my sight
welcome ye deserts and ye caves
my native land—good night

on on the vessel flies the land is gone
and winds are rude in biscays sleepless bay
four days are sped but with the fifth anon
new shores descried make every bosom gay
and cintras mountain41 greets them on their way
and tagus dashing onward to the deep
his fabled golden tribute42 bent to pay
and soon on board the lusian pilots leap
and steer twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reapap
32

oh christ it is a goodly sight to see
what heaven hath done for this delicious landaq
what fruits of fragrance blush on every tree
what goodly prospects oer the hills expand
but man would mar them with an impious hand
and when the almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
gainst those who most transgress his high command
with treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
gauls locust host and earth from fellest foemen purgear

what beauties doth lisboa43 first unfoldas
her image floating on that noble tide
which poets vainly pave with sands of goldat
but now whereon a thousand keels did ride
of mighty strength since albion was allied
and to the lusians did her aid afford33
a nation swoln with ignorance and pride44
who lick yet loathe the hand that waves the swordau
to save them from the wrath of gauls unsparing lord

but whoso entereth within this town
that sheening far celestial seems to be
disconsolate will wander up and down
mid many things unsightly to strange eeav
for hut and palace show like filthilyaw
the dingy denizens are reared in dirtax
ne personage of high or mean degree
doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt
though shent with egypts plague unkempt unwashed unhurt

poor paltry slaves yet born midst noblest scenes—
why nature waste thy wonders on such men34
lo cintras glorious eden intervenes45
in variegated maze of mount and glen
ah me what hand can pencil guide or pen
to follow half on which the eye dilates
through views more dazzling unto mortal kenay
than those whereof such things the bard relates
who to the awestruck world unlocked elysiums gates

the horrid crags by toppling convent crownedaz
the corktrees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep
the mountainmoss by scorching skies imbrowned
the sunken glen whose sunless shrubs must weep
the tender azure46 of the unruffled deep
the orange tints that gild the greenest bough
the torrents that from cliff to valley leapba
the vine on high the willow branch below
mixed in one mighty scene with varied beauty glow
35

then slowly climb the manywinding way
and frequent turn to linger as you go
from loftier rocks new loveliness survey
and rest ye at our ladys house of woe47 2b
where frugal monks their little relics show
and sundry legends to the stranger tell
here impious men have punished been and lo
deep in yon cave honorius long did dwell
in hope to merit heaven by making earth a hell
36

and here and there as up the crags you spring
mark many rudecarved crosses near the path48
yet deem not these devotions offering—
these are memorials frail of murderous wrath
for wheresoeer the shrieking victim hath
pourd forth his blood beneath the assassins knife
some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath
and grove and glen with thousand such are rife
throughout this purple land where law secures not life 3b

on sloping mounds or in the vale beneath49
are domes where whilome kings did make repair37
but now the wild flowers round them only breathe
yet ruined splendour still is lingering there
and yonder towers the princes palace fair
there thou too vathek englands wealthiest sonbb50
once formed thy paradise as not aware
when wanton wealth her mightiest deeds hath donebc
meek peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun

here didst thou dwell here schemes of pleasure plan
beneath yon mountains ever beauteous brow
but now as if a thing unblest by manbd
thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou38
here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
to halls deserted portals gaping wide
fresh lessons to the thinking bosom how
vain are the pleasaunces on earth suppliedbe
swept into wrecks anon by times ungentle tide

behold the hall where chiefs were late convened 4b
oh dome displeasing unto british eye
with diadem hight foolscap lo a fiend
a little fiend that scoffs incessantly
there sits in parchment robe arrayed and bybf
his side is hung a seal and sable scroll
where blazoned glare names known to chivalrybg
and sundry signatures adorn the rollbh
whereat the urchin points and laughs with all his soulbi
39

convention is the dwarfish demon styled51
that foiled the knights in marialvas dome
of brains if brains they had he them beguiled
and turned a nations shallow joy to gloom40
here folly dashed to earth the victors plume
and policy regained what arms had lost41
for chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom
woe to the conquering not the conquered host
since baffled triumph droops on lusitanias coast

and ever since that martial synod met
britannia sickens cintra at thy name
and folks in office at the mention fretbj
and fain would blush if blush they could for shame
how will posterity the deed proclaim
will not our own and fellownations sneer
to view these champions cheated of their fame
by foes in fight oerthrown yet victors here
where scorn her finger points through many a coming year
42

so deemed the childe as oer the mountains he
did take his way in solitary guise
sweet was the scene yet soon he thought to flee
more restless than the swallow in the skiesbk
though here awhile he learned to moralise
for meditation fixed at times on him
and conscious reason whispered to despise
his early youth misspent in maddest whim
but as he gazed on truth his aching eyes grew dim52

to horse to horse he quits for ever quits53
a scene of peace though soothing to his soulbl
again he rouses from his moping fits
but seeks not now the harlot and the bowlbm
onward he flies nor fixed as yet the goal
where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage43
and oer him many changing scenes must roll
ere toil his thirst for travel can assuagebn
or he shall calm his breast or learn experience sage

yet mafra shall one moment claim delay 5b
where dwelt of yore the lusians luckless queenbo54
and church and court did mingle their array
and mass and revel were alternate seen44
lordlings and freres—illsorted fry i ween
but here the babylonian whore hath built
a dome where flaunts she in such glorious sheen
that men forget the blood which she hath spilt
and bow the knee to pomp that loves to varnish guilt

oer vales that teem with fruits romantic hills
oh that such hills upheld a freeborn race
whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills
childe harold wends through many a pleasant placebp
though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase
and marvel men should quit their easy chair
the toilsome way and long long league to trace
oh there is sweetness in the mountain air
and life that bloated ease can never hope to share

more bleak to view the hills at length recede
and less luxuriant smoother vales extendbq
immense horizonbounded plains succeed
far as the eye discerns withouten end
spains realms appear whereon her shepherds tend
flocks whose rich fleece right well the trader knows—
now must the pastors arm his lambs defend
for spain is compassed by unyielding foes
and all must shield their all or share subjections woes
45

where lusitania and her sister meet
deem ye what bounds the rival realms dividebr
or ere the jealous queens of nations greet
doth tayo interpose his mighty tide
or dark sierras rise in craggy pride
or fence of art like chinas vasty wall—
ne barrier wall ne river deep and wide
ne horrid crags nor mountains dark and tall
rise like the rocks that part hispanias land from gaul55

but these between a silver streamlet56 glides
and scarce a name distinguisheth the brook
though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides
here leans the idle shepherd on his crook
and vacant on the rippling waves doth look
that peaceful still twixt bitterest foemen flow
for proud each peasant as the noblest duke
well doth the spanish hind the difference know
twixt him and lusian slave the lowest of the low 6b
46

but ere the mingling bounds have far been passedbs
dark guadiana rolls his power along
in sullen billows murmuring and vast
so noted ancient roundelays amongbt
whilome upon his banks did legions throng
of moor and knight in mailéd splendour drest
here ceased the swift their race here sunk the strong
the paynim turban and the christian crest
mixed on the bleeding stream by floating hosts oppressed57

oh lovely spain renowned romantic land
where is that standard58 which pelagio borebu
when cavas traitorsire first called the band
that dyed thy mountain streams with gothic gore 7b
where are those bloody banners which of yore
waved oer thy sons victorious to the gale47
and drove at last the spoilers to their shore59
red gleamed the cross and waned the crescent palebv
while africs echoes thrilled with moorish matrons wail

teems not each ditty with the glorious tale60
ah such alas the heros amplest fate
when granite moulders and when records fail
a peasants plaint prolongs his dubious datebw
pride bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate
see how the mighty shrink into a song
can volume pillar pile preserve thee great
or must thou trust traditions simple tongue
when flattery sleeps with thee and history does thee wrong

awake ye sons of spain awake advance
lo chivalry your ancient goddess cries
but wields not as of old her thirsty lance
nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies
now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies
and speaks in thunder through yon engines roar48
in every peal she calls—awake arise
say is her voice more feeble than of yore
when her warsong was heard on andalusias shore

hark—heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note
sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath
saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote
nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
tyrants and tyrants slaves—the fires of death
the balefires flash on high—from rock to rockbx
each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe
death rides upon the sulphury siroc61
red battle stamps his foot and nations feel the shock

lo where the giant on the mountain stands
his bloodred tresses deepening in the sun
with deathshot glowing in his fiery hands
and eye that scorcheth all it glares upon
restless it rolls now fixed and now anon
flashing afar—and at his iron feet49
destruction cowers to mark what deeds are done
for on this morn three potent nations meet
to shed before his shrine the blood he deems most sweet

by heaven it is a splendid sight to see62
for one who hath no friend no brother there
their rival scarfs of mixed embroideryby
their various arms that glitter in the air
what gallant warhounds rouse them from their lair
and gnash their fangs loud yelling for the prey
all join the chase but few the triumph share63
the grave shall bear the chiefest prize away
and havoc scarce for joy can number their array

three hosts combine to offer sacrifice
three tongues prefer strange orisons on high50
three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies64
the shouts are france spain albion victory
the foe the victim and the fond ally
that fights for all but ever fights in vain65
are met—as if at home they could not die—
to feed the crow on talaveras plain
and fertilise the field that each pretends to gain

there shall they rot—ambitions honoured foolsbz
yes honour decks the turf that wraps their clay66
vain sophistry in these behold the toolsca
the broken tools that tyrants cast away51
by myriads when they dare to pave their way
with human hearts—to what—a dream alone
can despots compass aught that hails their swaycb
or call with truth one span of earth their own
save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone

oh albuera glorious field of griefcc67
as oer thy plain the pilgrim pricked his steed
who could foresee thee in a space so brief
a scene where mingling foes should boast and bleedcd
peace to the perished may the warriors meedce
and tears of triumph their reward prolongcf
till others fall where other chieftains lead
thy name shall circle round the gaping throng
and shine in worthless lays the theme of transient songcg68
52

enough of battles minions let them play
their game of lives and barter breath for fame
fame that will scarce reanimate their clay
though thousands fall to deck some single name
in sooth twere sad to thwart their noble aim
who strike blest hirelings for their countrys goodch
and die that living might have proved her shame
perished perchance in some domestic feud
or in a narrower sphere wild rapines path pursuedci

full swiftly harold wends his lonely waycj69
where proud sevilla triumphs unsubduedck
yet is she free the spoilers wishedfor prey
soon soon shall conquests fiery foot intrude
blackening her lovely domes with traces rude
inevitable hour gainst fate to strive
where desolation plants her famished brood
is vain or ilion tyre might yet survive
and virtue vanquish all and murder cease to thrive
53

but all unconscious of the coming doom70
the feast the song the revel here abounds
strange modes of merriment the hours consume
nor bleed these patriots with their countrys wounds
nor here wars clarion but loves rebeck71 soundscl
here folly still his votaries inthralls
and youngeyed lewdness walks her midnight roundscm
girt with the silent crimes of capitals
still to the last kind vice clings to the tottring walls

not so the rustic—with his trembling mate
he lurks nor casts his heavy eye afar
lest he should view his vineyard desolate
blasted below the dun hot breath of war
no more beneath soft eves consenting star
fandango twirls his jocund castanet7254
ah monarchs could ye taste the mirth ye mar
not in the toils of glory would ye fretcn
the hoarse dull drum would sleep and man be happy yet

how carols now the lusty muleteer
of love romance devotion is his lay
as whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer
his quick bells wildly jingling on the way
no as he speeds he chants vivā el rey 8b
and checks his song to execrate godoy
the royal wittol charles and curse the day
when first spains queen beheld the blackeyed boy
and gorefaced treason sprung from her adulterate joy

on yon long level plain at distance crowned73
with crags whereon those moorish turrets rest55
widescattered hoofmarks dint the wounded ground
and scathed by fire the greenswards darkened vest
tells that the foe was andalusias guest
here was the camp the watchflame and the host
here the bold peasant stormed the dragons nest
still does he mark it with triumphant boast
and points to yonder cliffs which oft were won and lost

and whomsoeer along the path you meet
bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue
which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet 9b
woe to the man that walks in public view
without of loyalty this token true
sharp is the knife and sudden is the stroke
and sorely would the gallic foeman rue
if subtle poniards wrapt beneath the cloke
could blunt the sabres edge or clear the cannons smoke

at every turn morenas dusky height74
sustains aloft the batterys iron load
and far as mortal eye can compass sight
the mountainhowitzer the broken road56
the bristling palisade the fosse oerflowed
the stationed bands the nevervacant watchco
the magazine in rocky durance stowed
the bolstered steed beneath the shed of thatch
the ballpiled pyramid the everblazing match 10b

portend the deeds to come—but he whose nod
has tumbled feebler despots from their sway
a moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod
a little moment deigneth to delay
soon will his legions sweep through these their way
the west must own the scourger of the worldcp
ah spain how sad will be thy reckoningday
when soars gauls vulture with his wings unfurledcq
and thou shall view thy sons in crowds to hades hurled

and must they fall the young the proud the brave
to swell one bloated chiefs unwholesome reign75
no step between submission and a grave
the rise of rapine and the fall of spain57
and doth the power that man adores ordain
their doom nor heed the suppliants appeal
is all that desperate valour acts in vain
and counsel sage and patriotic zeal—
the veterans skill—youths fire—and manhoods heart of steel

is it for this the spanish maid aroused
hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar
and all unsexed the anlace76 hath espoused
sung the loud song and dared the deed of war
and she whom once the semblance of a scar
appalled an owlets larum chilled with dread77
now views the columnscattering baynet jarcr
the falchion flash and oer the yet warm dead
stalks with minervas step where mars might quake to tread

ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale
oh had you known her in her softer hour58
marked her black eye that mocks her coalblack veil
heard her light lively tones in ladys bower
seen her long locks that foil the painters power
her fairy form with more than female grace
scarce would you deem that saragozas tower
beheld her smile in dangers gorgon face
thin the closed ranks and lead in glorys fearful chase

her lover sinks—she sheds no illtimed tear
her chief is slain—she fills his fatal post
her fellows flee—she checks their base career
the foe retires—she heads the sallying host
who can appease like her a lovers ghost
who can avenge so well a leaders fall
what maid retrieve when mans flushed hope is lost
who hang so fiercely on the flying gaul
foiled by a womans hand before a battered wall 11b

yet are spains maids no race of amazons
but formed for all the witching arts of love
though thus in arms they emulate her sons
and in the horrid phalanx dare to move
tis but the tender fierceness of the dove
pecking the hand that hovers oer her mate
in softness as in firmness far above
remoter females famed for sickening prate
her mind is nobler sure her charms perchance as great
59

the seal loves dimpling finger hath impressedcs
denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch 12b
her lips whose kisses pout to leave their nest
bid man be valiant ere he merit such
her glance how wildly beautiful how much
hath phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek
which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch
who round the north for paler dames would seek
how poor their forms appear how languid wan and weak78

match me ye climes which poets love to laud
match me ye harems of the land where now60
i strike my strain far distant to applaud
beauties that evn a cynic must avowct
match me those houries whom ye scarce allow
to taste the gale lest love should ride the wind
with spains darkglancing daughters—deign to know
there your wise prophets paradise we find
his blackeyed maids of heaven angelically kind

oh thou parnassus whom i now survey79 13b
not in the phrensy of a dreamers eye
not in the fabled landscape of a laycu
but soaring snowclad through thy native sky
in the wild pomp of mountainmajesty
what marvel if i thus essay to sing
the humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
would gladly woo thine echoes with his string
though from thy heights no more one muse will wave her wing
61

oft have i dreamed of thee whose glorious name
who knows not knows not mans divinest lore
and now i view thee—tis alas with shame
that i in feeblest accents must adore
when i recount thy worshippers of yore
i tremble and can only bend the knee
nor raise my voice nor vainly dare to soar
but gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
in silent joy to think at last i look on thee80

happier in this than mightiest bards have been
whose fate to distant homes confined their lot
shall i unmoved behold the hallowed scene
which others rave of though they know it not
though here no more apollo haunts his grot
and thou the muses seat art now their grave62
some gentle spirit still pervades the spot
sighs in the gale keeps silence in the cave
and glides with glassy foot oer yon melodious wavecv

of thee hereafter—evn amidst my strain
i turned aside to pay my homage here
forgot the land the sons the maids of spain
her fate to every freeborn bosom dear
and hailed thee not perchance without a tear
now to my theme—but from thy holy haunt
let me some remnant some memorial bearcw
yield me one leaf of daphnes deathless plant
nor let thy votarys hope be deemed an idle vaunt

but neer didst thou fair mount when greece was young
see round thy giant base a brighter choir81
nor eer did delphi when her priestess sung
the pythian hymn with more than mortal fire
behold a train more fitting to inspire
the song of love than andalusias maids63
nurst in the glowing lap of soft desire
ah that to these were given such peaceful shades
as greece can still bestow though glory fly her glades

fair is proud seville let her country boast
her strength her wealth her site of ancient days 14b
but cadiz rising on the distant coast82
calls forth a sweeter though ignoble praise
ah vice how soft are thy voluptuous ways
while boyish blood is mantling who can scapecx
the fascination of thy magic gaze
a cherubhydra round us dost thou gape
and mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape

when paphos fell by time—accurséd time
the queen who conquers all must yield to thee—
the pleasures fled but sought as warm a clime
and venus constant to her native sea
to nought else constant hither deigned to flee
and fixed her shrine within these walls of white64
though not to one dome circumscribeth she
her worship but devoted to her rite
a thousand altars rise for ever blazing bright83

from morn till night from night till startled morn84
peeps blushing on the revels laughing crew
the song is heard the rosy garland worn
devices quaint and frolics ever new
tread on each others kibes85 a long adieu
he bids to sober joy that here sojourns
nought interrupts the riot though in lieucy
of true devotion monkish incense burns
and love and prayer unite or rule the hour by turnscz
65

the sabbath comes a day of blessed rest
what hallows it upon this christian shore
lo it is sacred to a solemn feast
hark heard you not the forestmonarchs roar
crashing the lance he snuffs the spouting gore
of man and steed oerthrown beneath his horn
the thronged arena shakes with shouts for more
yells the mad crowd oer entrails freshly torn
nor shrinks the female eye nor evn affects to mourn
86

the seventh day this—the jubilee of man
london right well thou knowst the day of prayer
then thy spruce citizen washed artisan
and smug apprentice gulp their weekly air
thy coach of hackney whiskey87 onehorse chair66
and humblest gig through sundry suburbs whirlda
to hampstead brentford harrow make repair
till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl
provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churldb

some oer thy thamis row the ribboned fairdc
others along the safer turnpike fly
some richmondhill ascend some scud to ware
and many to the steep of highgate hie
ask ye boeotian shades the reason why 15b
tis to the worship of the solemn horn8867
grasped in the holy hand of mystery
in whose dread name both men and maids are sworn
and consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn

all have their fooleries—not alike are thine
fair cadiz rising oer the dark blue sea89
soon as the matin bell proclaimeth nine
thy saintadorers count the rosary
much is the virgin teased to shrive them free
well do i ween the only virgin there
from crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be
then to the crowded circus forth they fare
young old high low at once the same diversion share

the lists are oped the spacious area cleared90
thousands on thousands piled are seated round68
long ere the first loud trumpets note is heard
ne vacant space for lated wight is found
here dons grandees but chiefly dames abound
skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye
yet ever well inclined to heal the wound
none through their cold disdain are doomed to die
as moonstruck bards complain by loves sad archery

hushed is the din of tongues—on gallant steeds
with milkwhite crest gold spur and lightpoised lance
four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds
and lowlybending to the lists advance69
rich are their scarfs their chargers featly prance
if in the dangerous game they shine today
the crowds loud shout and ladies lovely glance
best prize of better acts they bear away
and all that kings or chiefs eer gain their toils repay

in costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed
but all afoot the lightlimbed matadore
stands in the centre eager to invade
the lord of lowing herds but not before
the ground with cautious tread is traversed oer
lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed
his arms a dart he fights aloof nor more
can man achieve without the friendly steed—
alas too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed

thrice sounds the clarion lo the signal falls
the den expands and expectation mute
gapes round the silent circles peopled walls
bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute
and wildly staring spurns with sounding foot
the sand nor blindly rushes on his foe
here there he points his threatening front to suit
his first attack widewaving to and fro
his angry tail red rolls his eyes dilated glow
70

sudden he stops—his eye is fixed—away—
away thou heedless boy prepare the spear
now is thy time to perish or display
the skill that yet may check his mad career
with welltimed croupe91 the nimble coursers veer
on foams the bull but not unscathed he goes
streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear
he flies he wheels distracted with his throes
dart follows dart—lance lance—loud bellowings speak his woes

again he comes nor dart nor lance avail
nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse
though man and mans avenging arms assail
vain are his weapons vainer is his force
one gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse
another hideous sight unseamed appears
his gory chest unveils lifes panting source
though deathstruck still his feeble frame he rears
staggering but stemming all his lord unharmed he bears
71

foiled bleeding breathless furious to the last
full in the centre stands the bull at bay
mid wounds and clinging darts and lances brast92
and foes disabled in the brutal fray
and now the matadores93 around him play
shake the red cloak and poise the ready brand
once more through all he bursts his thundering way—
vain rage the mantle quits the conynge hand
wraps his fierce eye—tis past—he sinks upon the sanddd

where his vast neck just mingles with the spine
sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies
he stops—he starts—disdaining to decline
slowly he falls amidst triumphant cries
without a groan without a struggle dies
the decorated car appears—on high
the corse is piled—sweet sight for vulgar eyes—de9472
four steeds that spurn the rein as swift as shy
hurl the dark bulk along scarce seen in dashing by

such the ungentle sport that oft invites
the spanish maid and cheers the spanish swain
nurtured in blood betimes his heart delights
in vengeance gloating on anothers pain
what private feuds the troubled village stain
though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe
enough alas in humble homes remain
to meditate gainst friend the secret blow
for some slight cause of wrath whence lifes warm stream must flow95

but jealousy has fled his bars his bolts
his withered centinel96 duenna sage
and all whereat the generous soul revoltsdf
which the stern dotard deemed he could encage73
have passed to darkness with the vanished age
who late so free as spanish girls were seen
ere war uprose in his volcanic rage
with braided tresses bounding oer the green
while on the gay dance shone nights loverloving queen

oh many a time and oft had harold loved
or dreamed he loved since rapture is a dream
but now his wayward bosom was unmoved
for not yet had he drunk of lethes stream
and lately had he learned with truth to deem
love has no gift so grateful as his wings
how fair how young how soft soeer he seem
full from the fount of joys delicious springsdg
some bitter oer the flowers its bubbling venom flings 16b

yet to the beauteous form he was not blind
though now it moved him as it moves the wise
not that philosophy on such a mind
eer deigned to bend her chastelyawful eyes
but passion raves herself97 to rest or flies
and vice that digs her own voluptuous tomb74
had buried long his hopes no more to risedh
pleasures palled victim lifeabhorring gloom
wrote on his faded brow curst cains unresting doom98

still he beheld nor mingled with the throng
but viewed them not with misanthropic hate
fain would he now have joined the dance the song
but who may smile that sinks beneath his fate
nought that he saw his sadness could abate
yet once he struggled gainst the demons sway
and as in beautys bower he pensive sate
poured forth his unpremeditated lay

our first object was the convent of nossa senhora da penha the little romantic pile of white building i had seen glittering from afar when i first sailed by the coast of lisbon from this pyramidical elevation the view is boundless you look immediately down upon an immense expanse of sea

before the entrance formed by two ledges of ponderous rock extends a smooth level of greensward the hermitage its cell chapel and refectory are all scooped out of the native marble and lined with the bark of the cork tree several of the passages are not only roofed but floored with the same material  the shrubberies and gardenplots dispersed amongst the mossy rocks  are delightful and i took great pleasure in  following the course of a transparent rill which was conducted through a rustic watershoot between bushes of lavender and roses many of the tenderest green—ibid p 250

49 beckford describing the view from the convent notices the wild flowers which adorned the ruined splendour amidst the crevices of the mouldering walls  i noticed some capillaries and polypodiums of infinite delicacy and on a little flat space before the convent a numerous tribe of pinks gentians and other alpine plants fanned and invigorated by the fresh mountain air—italy etc 1834 p 229

in golden characters right well designed
first on the list appeareth one junot
then certain other glorious names we find
which rhyme compelleth me to place below
dull victors baffled by a vanquished foe
wheedled by conynge tongues of laurels due
stand worthy of each other in a row—
sirs arthur harry and the dizzard hew
dalrymple seely wight sore dupe of tother tew
convention is the dwarfy demon styled
that failed the knights in marialvas dome
of brains if brains they had he them beguiled
and turned a nations shallow joy to gloom
for well i wot when first the news did come
that vimieras field by gaul was lost
for paragraph ne paper scarce had room
such pæans teemed for our triumphant host
in courier chronicle and eke in morning post
but when convention sent his handy workbr 
pens tongues feet hands combined in wild uproar
mayor aldermen laid down the uplifted fork
the bench of bishops half forgot to snore
stern cobbetta—who for one whole week forbore
to question aught once more with transport leapt
and bit his devilish quill agen and swore
with foes such treaty never should be kept
while roared the blatant beastb and roared and raged and—slept
thus unto heaven appealed the people heaven
which loves the lieges of our gracious king
decreed that ere our generals were forgiven
enquiry should be held about the thing
but mercy cloaked the babes beneath her wing
and as they spared our foes so spared we them
where was the pity of our sires for byngc
yet knaves not idiots should the law condemn
then live ye gallant knights and bless your judges phlegm
