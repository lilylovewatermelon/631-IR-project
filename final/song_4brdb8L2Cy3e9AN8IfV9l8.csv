i guess you could call it textbook
i was lookin for the father i wanted back
and i thought i found it in brentwood
it seemed only appropriate youd easily have my back

prechorus
and then there was the issue of her
i didnt even like myself or love the life i had
and there you were with shining stars
standin blue with open arms
you touched the detriment most of the friends i knew already had

chorus
youve got a thunderbird my daddy had one too
lets rewrite history ill do this dance with you
you know im not that girl you know ill never be
maybe just the way were different could set me free
and there we were screamin black lives matter in the crowd
by the old man river and i saw you saw who i am
god i wish i was with my father
he could see us in all our splendor
all the things i couldnt want for him
i screamed for them ohohoh
i screamed for them ahah
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeverse 2
could we do this dance again
do you think if i go blonde we could get our old love back
i guess this is really the end
i never felt jealous before this year but im jealous now

prechorus
people say were too much alike
but maybe finally thatll make it right
at the end of all these sleepless nights
other men i met felt right
would smile at you and stick a knife
in your back
finally i met you so im not wonderin why

chorus
youve got a thunderbird my daddy had one too
lets rewrite history ill do this dance with you
you know im not that girl you know ill never be
maybe just the way were different could set me free
there we were screamin black lives matter in the crowd
by the old man river and i saw you saw who i am
god i wish i was with my father
he could see us in all our splendor
all the things i couldnt want for him
i screamed for them ohohoh
i screamed for them ahah
outro
old man river keeps rollin
with or without him
old man river keeps rollin
without him oh my old man
old man river keeps rollin oh52embed"
