sherri you smell different
get up early in the bed for you morning comes so easy
spells have been cast and the urge has been lost
snipers posted bills as they should of our midnight vacation

chorus
back on the planet now
im beginning to see just how
echelon your dreams and theyll come true
type slowly

verse 2
one of us is a cigar stand
and one of us is a lovely blue incandescent guillotine
the edge of creation is blurred and blushed
not a lot of room to grow inside this leather terrarium

chorus
people of the bay
it is excruciatingly gray
face the front when he comes for you
type slowly

instrumental bridge

cherish your memorized weakness
fashioned from a manifesto
lady i am no futurist im my only critic i
trolls in the glen are consorting again
the liberals say they dont exist but i know that they do

chorus
reinforce your literal ass
hit it on the first or second pass
frozen images respected few
