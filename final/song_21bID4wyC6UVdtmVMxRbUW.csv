cheap fake
easy to break
that’s how i used to be
here take it
now i’m awake
i’ll tell you what i see
plastic don’t shine
glitter don’t shine
rhinestones don’t shine
the way you do
you are so real
you are so rare
i see you there
i see you
i see stars
so many stars tonight
you could make diamonds dull
you are so beautiful

i see stars
you shine as bright as day
i will look out for you
we’ll light each other’s way
you’re all stars
you might also likesee i went low not high
that was my problem mine
don’t be frightened like me
the darker the night
the brighter you shine

plastic don’t shine
glitter don’t shine
rhinestones don’t shine
the way you do

you are on fire
you can rise higher
up in the sky
enjoy the view

you stars
so many stars tonight
you could make diamonds dull
you are so beautiful
i see stars

you are real
and you are rare
i want to say
i see you there
it’s me and you
not us and her
cause if we knew
cady regina gretchen  karen
how strong we were

cady
we’d say what we are

ensemble
stars

cady regina gretchen  karen
say what you are

ensemble
we’re stars

all ensemble
you’re a star we are stars
so many stars tonight
you could make diamonds dull
you are so beautiful

i see stars we are stars
we shine as bright as day
i will look out for you
we’ll light each other’s way
i see stars
i see stars i see stars
so many stars tonight i see stars
we could make diamonds dull i see stars
we are so beautiful i see stars
i see stars

we shine as bright as day
i will look out for you
we’ll light each other’s way
we are so real
we are so rare

we see you there we see you
we’re all stars
we’re all stars
so many stars
