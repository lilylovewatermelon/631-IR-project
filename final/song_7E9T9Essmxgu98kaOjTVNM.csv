carrie and lowell
such a long time ago
like a dead horse
meadowlark drive your arrow
season of hope after the flood
valentine spurn my sorrow
head on the floorboards covered in blood
drunk as a horsefly
climb on the mattress pad
twist my arm
under the pear tree
shadows and light conspiring
covered bridge i scream
cottage grove shade invite me

i will bow down didos lament
lord of the ancient waters
from the backyard as far as she went
carrie surprised me
erebus on my back
my lucky charm
you might also likecarried by stones
fairyland all around us
like a dead horse
sign of your children’s fever

carrie come home thorazine’s friend
holding your hands with opal
like a dead horse shall we ascend
flight of the mayfly
ephemera on my back
she breaks my arm10embed"
