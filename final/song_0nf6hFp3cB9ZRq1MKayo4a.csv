no time for questions he was just protecting his family
that thief picked the wrong street
some may not agree and thats their right but i believe
in what was written in what was given a long time ago
for those who wanna know

am i proud of where im from
how i was raised my daddys ways in this country that i love
am i proud that all i see
is black and white wrong or right and there aint no changing me
am i proud of where i stand damn right i am

at the airport today i met a soldier on his way
back home to denver he had just been injured defending me
talked a while and i told him he was in my prayers
and i thought right then and there

am i proud of where im from
how i was raised my daddys ways in this country that i love
am i proud that all i see
is black and white wrong or right and there aint no changing me
am i proud of where i stand damn right i am

am i proud of where im from
how i was raised my daddys ways in this country that i love
am i proud that all i see
is black and white wrong or right and there aint no changing me
am i proud of where i stand am i proud of who i am
youre damn right i am
