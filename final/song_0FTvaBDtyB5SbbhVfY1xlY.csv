verse 1
now somehow you feel left out
somehow youre feeling doubt
got an inch but took a mile oh no
right now your bodys in need
cant replace what you had in me
my words are cutting deep oh no

prechorus
youve watched me fall now im colder than winter
my love you forgot let me help you remember
i loved you like you never been
so overdosed on your own medicine

chorus
theres no need to call me on the phone
telling me how much youre alone
enemy of my state of mind
now im a villain im the villain
i told you that you would need my love
i gave you my all but that wasnt enough
enemy of my state of mind
now im a villain baby im the villain of your love

prechorus
youve watched me fall now im colder than winter
