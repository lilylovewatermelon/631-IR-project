you say you need someone
but everybody does
im no different than you
i just believe what i do
you point your finger at
everyone but yourself
and blame the ones that you love
whore only tryin to help

prechorus
as its winding down to zero
i am your unlikely hero
ill see this through
theres so much me in you
take this enemy together
fight these demons off forever
forever forever forever

chorus
five four three two one
i wont stop until its done
no curtain call i will not fall
this may be the one weve been waiting for
no curtain call just take it all
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeverse 2
i have no time for fear
or people in my ear
head down and running so fast
try not to dwell on the past
im fighting through this pain
and things i cannot change
running right into the flames
rather than running away

prechorus
as its winding down to zero
i am your unlikely hero
ill see this through
theres so much me in you
take this enemy together
fight these demons off forever
forever forever forever

chorus
five four three two one
i wont stop until its done
no curtain call i will not fall
this may be the one weve been waiting for
no curtain call just take it all
bridge
sweat drips down from every angle
love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
you turn up the heat
tossing and turning you cannot sleep
quietly weep youre in too deep

chorus
five four three two one
i wont stop until its done
no curtain call i will not fall
this may be the one weve been waiting for
no curtain call just take it all
five four three two one
i wont stop until its done
no curtain call i will not fall
this may be the one weve been waiting for
no curtain call just take it all2embed"
