thought i almost died in my dream again baby almost died
fightin for my life i couldnt breathe again
im fallin in too deep oh oh
without you i cant sleep fallin in
cause my heart belongs to you
ill risk it all for you
i want you next to me

i wanna share babies
protection we wont need
your body next to me
is just a memory
im fallin in too deep oh
without you i cant sleep
insomnia relieve oh
talk to me without you i cant breathe

verse 2
my darkest hours
girl i felt so alone inside of this crowded room
different girls on the floor distractin my thoughts of you
i turned into the man i used to be to be
put myself to sleep
just so i can get closer to you inside my dreams
didnt wanna wake up less you were beside me
