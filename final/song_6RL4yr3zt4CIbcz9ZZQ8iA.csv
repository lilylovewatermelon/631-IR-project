this town was built on muddy stilts
by the lunatic parade
well it rains like revelations
gonna wash these freaks away
some girls wanna hold your hand
and some girls like to pray
well my girl takes her drinks
with dust and rusty razor blades
as i lie between these covers
i wanna tell her that i love it
when she chokes me in the
backseat of her riverboat cause

chorus
shes my man
and we got all the balls we need
when you taste that pavement
youre amazed
she smells your sympathy
so bye bye ladies
may the best queen hold the crown
for the most bush sold on the levee
my my how word gets around
she strangles for a good time
and she kills my selfcontrol
shes my man dont be too sad sonny
cause shell never be your woman no more

someday soon this dank lagoons
gonna sink right into hell
theyll hide you from big ida
at the sho enough hotel
the ladies of the evenings just
a tombstone in your bed
well my girl eats a wounded preacher
tween two loaves of bread
i know shes up to something
but how can i run when shes just
keelhauled twentyone to nothing
ill stay next to the steel coal oven cause

chorus
shes my man
and we got all the balls we need
when you taste that pavement
youre amazed
she smells your sympathy
so bye bye ladies
may the best queen hold the crown
for the most bush sold on the levee
my my how word gets around
she strangles for a good time
and she kills my selfcontrol
shes my man dont be too sad sonny
cause shell never be your woman no more
bridge
all you needs just a fist of a tearstained bunny
when the good ship comes to town
who said loves a bitchll sit next to me honey
because this old boats gonna run aground
cause i dont want to be the burden
or your jealous bastard
i dont wanna be the tarzan of your next epic disaster

chorus
shes my man
and we got all the balls we need
when you taste that pavement
youre amazed
she smells your sympathy
so bye bye ladies
may the best queen hold the crown
for the most bush sold on the levee
my my how word gets around
she strangles for a good time
and she kills my selfcontrol
shes my man dont be too sad sonny
cause shell never be your woman no more

outro
shes my man cant you feel her comin
shes my man shes gonna keep you runnin
shes my man shes gonna teach you something
shes my shes my manembed"
