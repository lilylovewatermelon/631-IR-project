this sounds like karate
is this karate

chorus nahveyah  akeem ali
i need me some measuring tape
i can’t measure the hate
when these rap niggas come around
but how could you measure it dawg
when an ounce of that shit
probably feel like a hundred pounds
bitch i need some measuring tape
i’mma kill it and see how far i put it underground
look fuck the measuring
aye we gone yellow tape it if these niggas don’t dumb it down

verse 1 nahveyah
i hope they don’t dumb it down
i’m finna thumb it up
i’m finna wish em luck
i’m finna gas em up
fuck it let’s stick em up
i see a better look
i see it straight еven tho i’m a fucking crook
i am a maniac
every since i was a kid еating apple jacks
milking the game
a serial killer
that was my aim
you facing defeat when you aim
shout out tory lanez ay
i gut them with scissors
2 bitches they scissoring
listening to sza
she say it “hit different”
when i’m on the track
i play in her “garden” she “say it like that”
i had a question about my next sentence
if they 6 feet under
is that social distance
if i’m in your hood would i be a piston
will i catch u slipping like a transmission
i got the game on lock
the way that i work it
gone  send me to the gulag
i got my head in this murder shit
i wrap it and murder it
use yellow tape as my durag
i’m standing 10 toes both feet on they neck
get big as you roll the snow ball effect
as far as lil mama
she had double d’s like she did bad on both of her test

“hold on don’t touch me after i bust”

and you may got a song
but that shit ain’t making no noise
oh so you pootie tang
bitch i still got my dick in my hand
telling yo bitch to get in a stance
i don’t play i just sit in the stands
after we punt bitch i don’t wanna kick it again
i’m jelly this shit is a jam
this shit can get wicked my nigga i feel like a seat belt

i put my key in her box and she told me that shit won’t fit so i told her to jiggle it then
