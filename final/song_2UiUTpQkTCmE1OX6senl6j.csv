alright

verse 1
to know you is to hate you
so lovin you must be like suicide
well i dont mind if you dont mind
hell i am not the one thats gonna die
i guess i just cant listen
to this onesided conversation again
cause i dont care if i dont care
well no one ever said that life was fair

chorus
well everybody loves a joke but no one likes a fool
and youre always cracking the same old lines again
youre well rehearsed on every verse and that was stated clear
but no one understands your verity

verse 2
the center of attention
got an honorable mention once again
congratulations and salutations
youre a figment of your own imagination

chorus
well everybody loves a joke but no one likes a fool
and youre always cracking the same old lines again
youre well rehearsed on every verse and that was stated clear
but no one understands your verity

outro
to know you is to bait you
and you fell victim to your own denial
well i dont mind if you dont mind
youre wastin all your time6embed"
