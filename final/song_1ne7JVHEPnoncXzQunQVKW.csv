so give us room to do our thing cause we aint come to hurt no one
so eerybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

verse 1
man first of all im a boss i just want to get that across
man even my dentist hates when i floss

garbage bag for one of the windows spraypainted doors
with the flames on em michigan plates and my names on em
baby shadys here come and get him if you dames want him
but he aint stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
hes immune to cupid why you tryna put your claims on him
cause you wont do to me what you did to the last man
now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
theres a half a gallon in it that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin home now can i get that lap dance
shes got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
in the streets of warren michigan we call em “tramp stamps”
that means she belongs to me time to put the damn clamps down
and show this hussy whos the man now get amped dance

verse 2
pull a fifth of bacardi from out of my underwear
and walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
lookin like a zombie from night of the living dead
and tomorrow ill probably still be too high to get out of bed
til i feel like i been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
mixin hennessy and fanta with pepto and mylanta woo
i shoot the gift like im hollerin “die santa”
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders yeah
so quit tryna play the wall like you paul and
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
they call me the stephon marbury of rap darlin
cause as soon as they throw on some r kelly i start ballin
makin it rain for the ladies in the minis
but im not throwin ones five tens or even twenties
im throwin quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies
man i do this for them bunnies up at dennys
from the north east and west—
but when it comes to them trailers in them southparks
muffle it cause homie that hoods tighter than kennys
so ladies if your belly buttons not an innie then im outtie
now hop in my minivan lets get rowdy
come on
chorus
now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
aint nothin but a white trash party white trash party
so lets have us a little bash
and if anyone asks it aint no one but us trash
you dont know you better ask somebody
cause were having a white trash party white trash party

bridge
now whether youre black white or purple if youre misunderstood
but you dont give a fuck you aint doin shit that you should
long as you know youre up to evil and youre no damn good
get on the floor man and rep your hood

verse 3
now honey dont let them pricks trip
we should make a quick dip
and go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
cause girl i got a sick whip
kick the back window out of my gremlin
put two milk crates in the trunk rip out the stick shift
and make a fiveseater ill be damned if i feed a chick
it aint like me to split a piece of dry pita
i be the sltotheim to the shady
and i dont need a tank top to be a wife beater
ill rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
fore i turn over a new leaf clown
ill tell you now im so raw i still need to unthaw
you feel me yall i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but baby a body like thats against the law
you the baddest little chain with the blades i ever saw
coleslaw containers empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up
chorus
now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
aint nothin but a white trash party
so lets have us a little bash
and if anyone asks it aint no one but us trash
you dont know you better ask somebody
cause were having a white trash party white trash party82embed"
