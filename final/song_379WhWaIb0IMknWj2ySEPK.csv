im sure that the streets are watching me
rather not run when the cops are stopping me
pulled over on the road they watching me
as they walk passed all the chicks are jockin me
ferrari truck on the side of the road
raspberry paint gloss sitting on 24s
give me a warning ticket letting me go
cause you can tell by the jewels that i aint an average joe
cause i meet fresh dimes daily
