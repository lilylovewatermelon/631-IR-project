foolish girl thought i’d be so lost without her
adolescence left to wither i didn’t have a choice
it was me or your silly boy
it was me or your silly boy

why do i justify
what you did wrong to me

you’re love drunk you’re blinded
you’ve lost the ones who love you most
this liars on fire
melted like wax a mess it grows
and you’re the one that chose him
that’s just how karma goes

why do i justify
what you did wrong to me

look at me now
look at me now
take a look at what i’ve become
don’t thank yourself i’m finally someone
look at me now
you raised me well i’ll give you that
but in my face you surely spat
would you look at me now
you might also likewhy oh why
why do i justify
what you did wrong to me

i’m alright
and i’m alive
and i’m just fine without you
without youembed"
