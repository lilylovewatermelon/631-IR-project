restless and reckless i need a clue
so show me a sign
i feel like making a move
real geographic a change in mood
well let go of everything we know

you and i will ride tonight
till the past is out of sight
we dont have to look back now
from the dark into the light
we can leave it all behind
we can stand together we dont have to look back now

im so much like you
caught in a moment coming unglued
in a world so big its not easy to choose
which path to take which pawn to move
so well let go of everything weve ever known

you and i will ride tonight
till the past is out of sight
we dont have to look back now
from the dark into the light
we can leave it all behind
we can stand together we dont have to look back now
you might also likeno one can stop us now
the world is rushing by
the wind is at our back
everythings new tonight

were going our own way
no matter what they say
the bridge is on fire
were flying higher now

you and i will ride tonight
till the past is out of sight
we dont have to look back now
we are knocking down the wall
all for one and one for all
we can stand together never gonna look back now

oh no oh no
we dont have to look back now
no no no no
we dont have to look back nowembed"
