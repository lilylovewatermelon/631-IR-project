bad luck never leaves
your jinx just floats around
like the taste inside your mouth
or the sound when your skull cracks
feel the growing pains
it means youre growing up too fast
telling white lies to black cats
stretch me out across the tracks

chorus
while you were sleeping i was blood red
sharp as a knife inside your stomach
im squeezing tight dont let the light in
no medicine

verse 2
daydream tendencies
had you smiling soft and sweet
keep those blurry memories
somewhere safe you may need them
you can make a wish
but theres no rabbit out the hat
realize its never coming back
realize its never coming back

while you were sleeping i was blood red
sharp as a knife inside your stomach
im squeezing tight dont let the light in
no medicine

outro
dont let the light in
