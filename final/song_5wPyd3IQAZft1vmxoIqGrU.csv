verse 1
she a loyal bitch you gotta pay for those
she a spoiled lil bitch i bought her all her clothes
you know i treat you good i dont wanna meet your hoes
i took you out the hood i took you to my shows
we took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
we tried some new things we fucked a couple hoes
you changin mood swings you got me i dont know
we gettin back in walked through the back door
you had some surgeries but its still fat though
you like the cash girl you helped the cash grow
you drive a lambo with some leg room
girl im waitin on you bring that bag home ooh
