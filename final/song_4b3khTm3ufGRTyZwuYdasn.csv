when i was young i thought the world of you
you were all that i wanted then
it faded and i never saw you again
but i wont forget the love we had

chorus
come to me now
dont let me go
stay by my side
dont let me go
stay with me still
ive missed you so

verse 2
when i was young i thought the world of you
i was dumb to let you drift away
and though i guess it had to come to an end
no one else could have the love we shared

chorus
come to me now
dont let me go
stay by my side
and my heart goes
out to you
wherever you are

chorus
come to me now
dont let me go
stay by my side
dont let me go
stay with me still
ive missed you so3embed"
