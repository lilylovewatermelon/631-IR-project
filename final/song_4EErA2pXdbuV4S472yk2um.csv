white kids dont dance
they just follow commands
put your right foot in
leave your heart in your hand
and spin like the record
i was making for you
you promised this forever
now im spinning alone its true

chorus
bigfoot is out there just knowing you dont care
about his life in solitude
hes dancing with the lonely hed choose you only
hed rock from side to side

verse 2
your life could change straight out of the blue
the clouds in your mind are just passing through
imagine the horses when they set em free go
tear down the beaches of chincoteague

chorus
bigfoot is out there just knowing you dont care
about his life in solitude
hes dancing with the lonely hed chose you only
hed rock from side to side

stay if you want to
leave if you have to
i want to see it through the dark
stay if you want to
leave if you have to
i want to see it through the dark

what love is gonna change your mind
what love is gonna change your mind
bigfoot running from the end of time
what love is gonna change your mindembed"
