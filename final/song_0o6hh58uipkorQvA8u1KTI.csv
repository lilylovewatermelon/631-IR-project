tina nolan had a man with a good place for siftin’
he invited me diggin’ so i picked up my screen
and a shovel to dig and a jar of shine
he traded me fair for a bottle of wine
his brother’s barnes mountain wine

verse 2
we trudged through the snow straight up the hillside
took a ridge for a while then we slowly went down
to an overhang hid from the ridgeline
we bent oer our handles and we bit in the ground
the dark and bloody ground

verse 3
was a bitch to break ground but the wine kept us goin
the moonshine was flowin and keepin us warm
cause you can’t hold a girl with a fistful of shovel
got to find your fire in the company of corn

verse 4
we dug for a while then it all turned to ashes
found a bunch of broke flint and a few bits of bone
then i heard jesse yell oer the pile he was siftin’
shook the hills like the angels were callin’ us home
jesse zachary come home
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 5
it was banded as hell it was fluted and clovis
it was hot as the pistol i kept on my side
i was fiendin’ so fierce i was broke ass and busted
i pulled out my pistol and i took jesse’s life

verse 6
a clovis like that is a hard point to find
makes pills swift to come by with a good chunk of change
left over for burn on whatever meanness
whatever woman is comin my way
darlin come my way

verse 7
i sit in this cell for the banded clovis
i stole off of nolan when i killedm that day
i reckon the chase of the pills and the powder
corn liquor and women are the culprits to blameembed"
