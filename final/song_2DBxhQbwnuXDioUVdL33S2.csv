yo i drop gems like a bad jewel thief im kool keith
dr octagon with a delivery from the octomom
the unabomber with a unibrow i stay connected
i make sure that the globe gets infected
explosion earthquakes mudslides erosion
global domination ima set it to a motion
emotion only for the weaker being make sure that nobody see
and show my intellect cause im a evil genius
futurama i hope youre ready to fry
you expect me to talk i expect you to die
i hang you out to dry from the washing machine
its like a movie critic way im peeping the scene son
said and done when its finished my nigga finito
when i go out i go out with a pound of c4
this for everybody out there tryna play a hero

chorus jesse rutherford  denzel curry
yeah it just might kill us all
it just might kill us all yeah

interlude jesse rutherford  denzel curry
be on watch you know they wanna kill us all

125Â° in the valley treading on a heatwave
i think we set the sky on fire breathing in every day
before you rise like a phoenix you gotta play jean grey
i just wanna flex i dont wanna be another ex yeah
keep it all up in my head now when i see red its a let down
always finding different ways to get down
whole wide world gone to shit now but i cant quit now
never been the type to just sit down
and shut up enemies tryna run up homie but i keep it all 100
minute that the sun up im thinking bout the money

chorus jesse rutherford  denzel curry
yeah it just might kill us all
it just might kill us all
it just might kill us all
it just might kill us all yeah

interlude vic mensa
