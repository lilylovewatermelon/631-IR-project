i woke up on angel island in your arms
to the smell of burning bridges
and the sound of those alarms in my head
we should have stayed in bed
but we held them up for ransom anyway
when the coldest days of winter
were the summers that we took aim at the bay
and grateful wasnt dead

hook 1
and like your lips were only made for me to kiss
ohohohoh
we were made for this

verse 2
while the girls all danced beneath a burning man
and the last waltz did somersaults
to finish off the band where they began
in a wonder winterland
all we ever wanted was to be alone
learning how to fly to sly
trying to find home
underneath the family stone

hook 2
and just like new years day was made to reminisce
ohohohoh
we were made for this
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3
love and stardust settle on us like a net
while buckleys hallelujah fills our ears from your cassette
while my heart stops beating
and you stop breathing juliette

hook 3
youre the only thing im ever gonna miss
ohohohoh
we were made for thisembed"
