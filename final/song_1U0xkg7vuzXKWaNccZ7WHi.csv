starin at the prettiest part of this powder keg world
sittin with the finest example of a beautiful girl
if we hadnt hit the brakes wed have no idea
paradise was hiding right here

chorus
dipping our toes in the water
i dont care if it gets any hotter
its you and me rememberin how to have fun
lets put our hearts together
two parts love and a pinch of good weather
and top it all off with the sun
and mix it with rum mmm mmm mmmm

verse 2
came out here to do a whole lot of nothing
and were doing pretty good i think
the only one thing we need to worry about
is filling up when the ice cubes clink

chorus
dipping our toes in the water
i dont care if it gets any hotter
its you and me remembering how to have fun
lets put our hearts together
two parts love and a pinch of good weather
and top it all off with the sun
and mix it with rum mmm mmm mmmm
mix it with rum mmm mmm mmmm
see brothers osborne liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebridge
lucky folks go to the ocean
the lakes for the landlocked ones
we got a tarp and a truck bed
a kiddie pool a slip and slide
let that garden hose run

chorus
dipping our toes in the water
i dont care if it gets any hotter
its you and me remembering how to have fun
lets put our hearts together
two parts love and a pinch of good weather
and top it all off with the sun
and mix it with rum mmm mmmmmmm
and mix it with rum mmm mmm mmmm
and mix it with rum mmm mmm mmmm1embed"
