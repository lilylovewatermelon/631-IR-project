sometimes blindness finds me ooh whoaoh oh
and leads me through ignorance
not allowing us to gain experience
so we become lifeless ohoh oh
at other times i cover with
selfpity or work aimlessly through reality so
occasionally i choose to travel alone
but never fulfil my possibility so ohoh oh
mostly i attempt to achieve balance
by seeking right knowledge and loving ohoh oh
and reviewing and eventually overstanding those
many lessons of my life

verse 1 marsha
you got me caught in a stormy odd world that drains
and i beg to see truth and promises you made to me
now weve come so far but my visions of happiness
with you in my life im afraid and confused
if i was a bird id fly

chorus marsha
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain

and what made you turn around on me

and when did love feel this way
so much pain and misery

and could ya fly with me

chorus marsha
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain

bridge marsha

chorus marsha
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain
if i was a bird id fly away
spread my wings so id escape
if i was the sky id let it rain
to wash away the pain

outro marsha

id let it rain to wash the pain
