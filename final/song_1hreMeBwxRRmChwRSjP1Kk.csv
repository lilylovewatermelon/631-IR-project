gunman bloodshot eyes
gunman grain of sand
sisters could not sleep
father is a holy ghost
and theres lions in a cage

chorus 1
it dont matter dont try to explain
youre just another dog to be trained
chokechained
youre gonna end up under tooth and nail
if you catch a tiger by the tail
dont fail

guitar solo

verse 2
brother does not dream anymore
sisters could not sleep
transformation incomplete mercy killing those counting sheep
im a trigger quick to fire punctuate betwixt the eyes
youre clever it aint gonna help you

chorus 2
violence is just an incomplete thought
coming to a complete stop
stop
youre so clever youll tear us apart
then masquerade it as art
not smart
if you can help anyone help yourself
thats unless you hate yourself
then dont help
you might also likebridge
angry ants are crawlin
makes you wanna scream

verse 3
lions clawing
building up steam
flesh and bone has no persuasion this is the pathway to my destination
gunman where you been
youre my hero savior psycho slayer

chorus 3
follow the leader you lead em the same
slugs punctuate the refrain
come again
it dont matter dont try to explain
youre just a dog to be trained
chokechained
you gonna end up under tooth and nail
if you catch a tiger by the tail
dont fail
i wanna go blind wanna stare at the sun
