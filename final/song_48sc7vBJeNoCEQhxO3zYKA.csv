oh my precious ember burning my sweet glowing light
from the moment i first saw you i was yours and you were mine
deep down we both knew you were trouble by design
and the echo of my mothers words baby dont you play with fire

prechorus
i was always playing the part
first love only set by a spark
there was no way changing my mind

chorus
now im under your spell trapped in a lie
shouldnt have stood that close to the fire
no turning back nowhere to run nowhere to hide
its too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god is this real
no more time
its too late its too late to say goodbye

verse 2
i can hear the sounds of sirens circling around
forced to watch the ashes floating softly drifting to the ground
deep down we both knew it was trouble by design
and the echo of my mothers words baby dont you play with fire

i was always playing the part
first love only set by a spark
there was no way changing my mind

chorus
now im under your spell trapped in a lie
shouldnt have stood that close to the fire
no turning back nowhere to run nowhere to hide
its too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god is this real
no more time
its too late its too late its too late to say goodbye

bridge
after all the dust has settled we can settle down
just the two of us forever no one else around
no one else around
around

chorus
now im under your spell trapped in a lie
shouldnt have stood that close to the fire
no turning back nowhere to run nowhere to hide
its too late to say goodbye
push back from my heart
wish we could go back to the start
but oh my god
no escape
no more time
its too late its too late its too late to say goodbye19embed"
