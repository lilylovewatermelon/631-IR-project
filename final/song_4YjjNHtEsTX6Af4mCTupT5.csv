i set out on a narrow way many years ago
hoping i would find true love along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
i couldnt see how every sign pointed straight to you

chorus
that every long lost dream led me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
yes he did

verse 2
i think about the years i spent just passing through
id like to have the time i lost and give it back to you
but you just smile and take my hand
youve been there you understand
its all part of a grander plan that is coming true

chorus
every long lost dream led me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you ooh
yeah

and now im just rolling home
into my lovers arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

outro
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
ooh mm25embed"
