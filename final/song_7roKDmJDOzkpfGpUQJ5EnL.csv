i got the belt and the shoes to match it
im from the hood im keepin my ratchet

i get him flipped then i buy him a casket
im servin real i aint just singin rappin
i got on soldier res theyre classics
i got a 31 doin gymnastics
i sold a brick it was still in the package
sixty five hundred was spent on this coat
got a bitch in the condo she snortin the coke
i dont wanna fuck her just want the throat
im savin my money i aint goin broke
dont want no handouts that shit aint no joke
they listen up when i speak im the pope
im bringin cash aint payin no notes
i got the stick just in case they want smoke
