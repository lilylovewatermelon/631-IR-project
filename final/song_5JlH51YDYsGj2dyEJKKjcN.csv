verse 1
dont need no five star reservations
i got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
dont need no concert in the city
i got a stereo and the best of patsy cline

prechorus
aint got no caviar no dom perignon
but as far as i can see i got everything i want

hook
because i got a roof over my head
the woman i love laying in my bed
and its alright alright
i got shoes under my feet
forever in the eyes staring back at me
and its alright alright
yeah i got all i need
and its alright by me

verse 2
maybe later on well walk down to the river
lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
it may not be no french riviera
