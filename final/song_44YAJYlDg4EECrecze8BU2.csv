verse 1 geazy
cause you deserve everything and more
youre royalty a true queen that a king adore
i need you by my side you the type i bring on tour
lets fall asleep in la wake up out in singapore
doing things i never did before
fuck being selfish i just wanna give you more
im going out my way so you know what im in it for
i pay attention all the little things to listen for
true loves true compromise
ride or die by my side as im on the rise
but if i fell off tomorrow would you disappear
sorry it sounds like i dont trust you i apologize
but im a lover and im tryna give you all of me
so if youre down to follow me
gotta do it honestly
you heard about them hoes my reputation follows me
but i just cut em off trading quantity for quality you know

verse 2 geazy
given you my all nothing less than
more than a wifey than my best friend
do it all for my baby not a question
your hatin friends keep hatin bless them
i wanna be in your room we could sleep all day
i wanna be somewhere the bullshit can stay away
i wanna get to the point where i dont have to lie
when you ask me is everything going to be okay
its easier to sell a dream than keep it real
its easier to numb the pain than really feel
make it vanish in a moment with a magic pill
its easier to lay away than pay the bill
uh would you stay with me if i was broke
when we look in these mirrors are we seein smoke
and this might be the realest shit i wrote
loves a challenge but this aint gotta be difficult
chorus louis mattrs
i wont settle for no less
give you my hardest no rest
i just wanna do you right
i hold heaven in both hands
give you my hardest no rest
i just wanna do you right girl
i just wanna do you right
