im sick of watching that sunset painting the sky red
i just wanna turn in early
i dont want to see where this goes
youre getting just a little too flirty
youre getting just a little too close

said nobody
said nobody ever

dont come any closer
dont give me a kiss
cause i dont wanna taste your lips
said nobody
said nobody ever

i wish youd just behave
i wish that strap would stay up there on your shoulder
i dont want to buy you another drink
id rather go home alone instead
i dont wanna wake up in the morning
slide to your side of the bed

i dont wanna know what it feels like
to be loved by a girl like you
last thing i need is your heart beating to my heart beat
and i dont wanna hear you say
