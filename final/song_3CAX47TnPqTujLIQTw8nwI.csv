hot sand on toes cold sand in sleeping bags
ive come to know that memories
were the best things you ever had
the summer shone beat down on bony backs
so far from home where the ocean stood
down dust and pine cone tracks
we slept like dogs down by the fire side
awoke to the fog where all around us
the boom of summertime

chorus
we stood
steady as the stars in the woods
so happyhearted and the warmth
rang true inside these bones
and as the old pine fell we sang
just to bless the morning

verse 2
hot sand on toes cold sand in sleeping bags
ive come to know the friends around you
are all youll always have
smoke in my lungs the echoed stone
careless and young free as the birds that fly
with weightless souls

we stood
steady as the stars in the woods
so happyhearted and the warmth
rang true inside these bones
we stood
steady as the stars in the woods
so happyhearted and the warmth
rang true inside these bones
and as the old pine fell we sang
just to bless the morning

bridge
we grow grow steady as the morning
here we grow grow older still
we grow grow happy as a new dawn
grow grow older still
we grow grow steady as the flowers
here we grow grow older still
we grow grow happy as a new dawn
grow grow older still
