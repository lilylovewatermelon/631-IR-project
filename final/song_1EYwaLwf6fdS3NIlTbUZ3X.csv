i miss you
and i wonder how you feel about me too
do you miss the way we would play
and waste our time away

suddenly
were apart and i cant see you every night
though wed fight i loved you so much
now i cant feel your touch

chorus
oh girlfriend
thats the end
and im lost without your love
oh love

verse 2
in your arms
i was happy as a little boy could be
taking pills and mellowin out
now i just want to shout

for your love
cause im drifting further from you every day
drivin by your place every night
i used to feel alright

and im lost without your love

when i dreamed to be alright
