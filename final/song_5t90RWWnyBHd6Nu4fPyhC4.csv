i was stressin head screwed on too tight
read your words that felt so close despite
you always wrote a letter inscribed ever so slight
just be yourself and ill be fine

chorus
ill try for you for you
ill try for you for you

verse 2
i read the thoughts that you didnt want to write
yes im at ease but it aint gone overnight
see my heads had one dream too many
but still youre there inside
just be yourself and ill be fine

chorus
ill try for you for you
ill try for you for you
ill try for you for you
ill try for you for you

bridge
mesdames messieurs nous allons bientôt nous quitter mais
sil vous reste quelque chose de ceci gardez à lesprit que la persévérance est essentielle
merci beaucoup et à bientôt
