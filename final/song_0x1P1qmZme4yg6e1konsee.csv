yeah get down nigga
i said get down
what you gotta say now
pussy
my name is dax and i just committed murder
yeah

verse
why everybody askin me if i’m a rapper im an artist
i just rap for fun but still do it the hardest
how i started was a baby given birth to by the carters
2pac biggie nas rakim my grandfathers
been rappin for two years and probably done been the farthest
had to spark it made a name by manipulatin’ the market
howd i start it put it in drive and i never parked it
this a message to the dearly and departed
this a motherfuckin killshot
aimin my scope at the fucking industry
half of these niggas rappin is trash and its fucking killin me
i made a name for myself by doing it differently
i started writing poetry then i had an epiphany
and instantly started meshin words into a symphony
and calculatin’ patterns and delivering them brilliantly
to go into your mind so i could paint a vivid imagery
and save you from the trash that you’ve been listenin to literally
nah this is not a game this is not a test
what’s the point of rappin if i aint tryna be the fuckin best
droppin’ songs faster than a virgin when the pussy wet
to swim into the mainstream with the sharks so i can come up next
eminem done paved the path pac saw me in a dream
me and drake from canada fuck you think that all mean
in my opinion i think that means that im the next best thing
eating beasting
now im motherfuckin top shit
fuck niggas dont wanna problem when i pop shit
gas niggas like im in a chamber this is auschwitz
all drip my bars coming out a faucet faucet
the crazy thing about this rap is bout the recognition
underrated is an understatement and im the definition
contemplated if i should kill em i had a premonition
ronald reagan the whole game and cause a demolition
niggas finna nut like dontai ooh
brought my skill to cali like lebron james ooh
know she wanna fuck and her friend do too
ksi a bitch get mentioned views
nah but real shit lil nigga dont you ever try to diss me or ill come for ya neck
ill be damned if an uncle tom corny ass nigga making vlogs try to talk if he aint showin respect
so let me break it down for you how i live out the rest of my whole career
i promise imma be one of the biggest in about a year
i promise ill be the one to convince you that thing fear
is a concoction by the devil to make the good disappear
i promise ill win a grammy i promise ill win an oscar
i promise the rap game wont turn me into a monster
and force the people who love me to treat me like im a sponsor
and pray for my death for money and not for a life longer
and thats facts thats facts
manifested all this shit through rap through rap
spoke my life into existence i was workin in the trenches swear to god that i aint ever going back
ot 613 put it on the map
treat a beat like 50 had to get the strap
ksi wanna beat me nigga you can cc the fee fee is 10k if you want a track
so you gon watch me on the tv nigga
i swear to god they gon keep this shit on repeat nigga
like four five six times best believe me nigga
im gon thrive cause the boy be a cheat sheet nigga
they gon ride riririririride
niggas talk shit they gon diiie
if i aint the best then thats a liiie
you can peep the drip im not dryyy
