when you gonna fire it up
when you gonna fire it up

verse 1
ive got you moving to the city
oh my you think youre looking pretty
but theyve got a pistol too
tucked down beneath their shoe
its a new sensation world annihilation
moving through the music patiently its waiting
the citys screaming i can hear them breathing
crying out for wisdom hungry minds are feeding

chorus
and i know that youre tired of this
cause youre a robot they designed your life
but true souls said you know whats right
and you can join us on the other side

interlude
are you scared
are you scared
are you scared

verse 2
ive got you marching to a drumbeat
oh my you got another nosebleed
theyll keep you so amused
youll never taste the truth
its a new creation total domination
chains across your shoulders social captivation
kill our leaders persecute our teachers
criticize our culture crucify free thinkers
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likechorus
i know that youre tired of this
cause youre a robot they designed your life
but true souls said you know whats right
and you can join us on the other side

breakdown
are you scared
are you scared
are you scared

verse 3
fill our eyes with money vanity thats cunning
only on the surface diamonds look so stunning
mass deception altered our perception
sold it to the children made a new connection

chorus
and i know that youre tired of this
cause youre a robot they designed your life
but true souls said you know whats right
and you can join us on the other side

outro
our sidewalks are broken our minds have been twisted
the billboards are lying the lies have been made
the streets are all empty we paved them with zombies
a lost generation generically made
when amidst all the madness i saw a flower
a dream that was creeping i kept in my sight
then it turned and it took me an explosion it shook me
beauty that screams im alive4embed"
