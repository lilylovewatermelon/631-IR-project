pure hearts stumble
in my hands they crumble
fragile and stripped to the core
i cant hurt you anymore

verse 2
loved by numbers
youre losing lifes wonder
touch like strangers detached
i cant feel you anymore

chorus 1
the sunshine trapped in our hearts
it could rise again
but im lost crushed cold and confused with no guiding light left inside

postchorus
you were my guiding light

guitar solo

chorus 2
when comfort and warmth cant be found i still reach for you
but im lost crushed cold and confused with no guiding light left inside

youre my guiding light
youre my guiding light
when theres no guiding light left inside
when theres no guiding light in our lives2embed"
