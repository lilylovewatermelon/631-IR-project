i dreamed i was missing you were so scared
but no one would listen cause no one else cared
after my dreaming i woke with this fear
what am i leaving when im done here

prechorus
so if youre asking me i want you to know

chorus
when my time comes
forget the wrong that ive done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
and dont resent me
and when youre feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest

verse 2
dont be afraid
ive taken my beating ive shared what i made
im strong on the surface not all the way through
ive never been perfect but neither have you
you might also likeprechorus
so if youre asking me i want you to know

chorus
when my time comes
forget the wrong that ive done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
dont resent me
and when youre feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest

bridge
forgetting all the hurt inside youve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
i cant be who you are

chorus
when my time comes
forget the wrong that ive done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
dont resent me
and when youre feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
outro
forgetting all the hurt inside youve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
i cant be who you are
i cant be who you are42embed"
