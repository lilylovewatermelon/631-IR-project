one two one two
one two three four

verse 1
dont listen what your girlfriend says
she reads those magazines
that say you failed the test
you dont have what she needs
i slither like a viper and get you by the neck
i know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

chorus 1
that bitch can eat her heart out
love bites but so do i so do i
love bites but so do i so do i
love bites

verse 2
my lips are pale and vicious
youre foamin out the mouth
youve suffered in the darkness
ill suck the pain right out
so come and taste the reason im nothin like the rest
i kiss you in a way youll never forget about me

that chick can eat her heart out
love bites but so do i so do i

breakdown
it sucks you in and kicks you down
and chews you up and spits you out
it messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
they say it’s blind they say it waits
but every time it seals your fate
now its got you by the balls and wont let go until you fall
i was down and out got up and said
“hey love ive had enough”
ive felt pleasure without pain
my soul youll never tame

guitar solo
love bites but so do i

chorus 3
love bites but so do i so do i
love bites but so do i so do i so do i
love bites but so do i so do i
