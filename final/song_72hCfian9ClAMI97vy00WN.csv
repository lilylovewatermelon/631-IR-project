you swear you recall nothing at all
that could make you come back down
you made up your mind to leave it all behind
now youre forced to fight it out

chorus
you fall away from your past
but its following you now
you fall away from your past
but its following you

verse 2
you left something undone its now your rerun
its the one you cant erase
you shouldve made it right so you wouldnt have to fight
to put a smile back on your face

chorus
you fall away from your past
but its following you
you fall away from your past
but its following you now

interlude
you fall away
you fall away

something ive done that i cant outrun
something ive done that i cant outrun
maybe you should wait maybe you should run
but theres something youve said that cant be undone

chorus
and you fall away from your past
but its following you
and you fall away from your past
but its following you now
and you fall away from your past
but its following you
and you fall away from your past
but its following you
its following you fall away
its following you fall away
its following you fall away4embed"
