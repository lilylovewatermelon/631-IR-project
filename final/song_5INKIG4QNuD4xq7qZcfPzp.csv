i could take the high road
but i know that im goin low
im a ban—im a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that im goin low
im a ban—im a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that im goin low
im a ban—im a bandito

verse 1
this is the sound we make
when in between two places
where we used to bleed
and where our blood needs to be

chorus
i could take the high road
but i know that im goin low
im a ban—im a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that im goin low
im a ban—im a bandito

verse 2
in city i feel my spirit is contained
like neon inside the glass they form my brain
but i recently discovered its a heatless fire
like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
begin with bullet now add fire to the proof
but im still not sure if fears a rival or close relative to truth
either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
the softest echo could be enough for me to make it through
