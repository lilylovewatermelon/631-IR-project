catch me lane switchin with the paint drippin
turn your neck and your dame missin

car stop rims keep spinnin
im flippin drop with invisible tops
hoes bop when my drop step out
im shakin the block with four eighteens
candy green with eleven screens
my gasoline always supreme
got doe doe to burn with a pint of lean
it takes grindin to be a king it takes grindin to be a king
first round draft picks comin who is mike jones comin
slab shinin with the grill and woman

verse 3 paul wall
what it do its paul wall im the peoples champ
my chain light up like a lamp cause now im back with the camp
im crawlin similar to an ant cause im low to the earth
peoples feelings get hurt when they figure out what im worth
i got eightyfours pokin out at the club im showin out
im a player aint no doubt hoes wanna know what im bout
biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
wood grain all in my range drippin stains when i switch lanes
switched the name its still the same swishahouse or swishablast
mike jones he runnin the game and magnificent bout his cash
michael watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
g dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
i got the internet goin nuts
but t farris got my back so now im holdin my nuts
its paul wall baby what you know bout me
im on that 59 southlea baby holler at me
