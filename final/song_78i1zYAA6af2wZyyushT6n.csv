why is everything so gray is everything so strange
is everything so thrown together by mistake
why is everything contrite is everything a plight
is everything so insincere and out of sight

prechorus
why does everything seem wrong
does everything look drawn
does everything seem blasted like it dont belong

chorus
i wanna make it a way
i wanna make it a way
i wanna make it a gross misadventure
i wanna make you all
i wanna make you all
i wanna make you
lie to me lie to me

verse 2
when did everything go bad did everything fall flat
did everything decay and lose itself so fast
when did everything succumb did everything go numb
did everything lobotomize what its become

when does everything come back
does everything relapse
does everything save face and find itself at last

chorus
i wanna show you the way
i wanna show you the waste
i wanna show you the worst misadventure
i wanna show you all
i wanna show you all
i wanna show you how to
die for me die for me

chorus
oh i wanna give it away
i wanna give it the waste
i wanna give it the worst misadventure
i wanna give it all
im gonna give it all
ill never give up
lie to me die for me

outro
now everythings a lie everythings your lie
everythings a face inside another lie
now everythings a side everythings one side
everything depends on just which side youre on2embed"
