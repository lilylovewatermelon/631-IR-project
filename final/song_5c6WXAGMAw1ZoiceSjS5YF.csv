before you go to the holland road
with your heart like a stone you spared no time in lashing out
and i knew your pain and the effect of my shame
but you cut me down you cut me down

and i will not tell the thoughts of hell
that carried me home from the holland road
with my heart like a stone and i put up no fight
to your calloused mind and from your corner you rose
to cut me down you cut me down

so i hit my low but little did i know
that would not be the end
from the holland road
well i rose and i rose and i paid less time
to your calloused mind and i wished you well
as you cut me down you cut me down

but i still believe though these cracks youll see
when im on my knees ill still believe
and when ive hit the ground neither lost nor found
if you believe in me ill still believe
but i still believe though these cracks youll see
when im on my knees ill still believe
and when ive hit the ground neither lost nor found
if you believe in me ill still believeyou might also like3embed"
