verse 1 kid cudi
i am the maniac i am the ghoul the ghoul
im in the shadows in the corner of my room my room
this my new hideaway this is my tomb tomb
this is my coffin this is my place for unruliness no worries
i love the darkness yeah id like to marry it
it is my cloak it is my shield it is my cape cape
i love the dark maybe we can make it darker darker
give me a marker

verse 2 cage
i am the maniac i am the fool
i found the monster in me when i lost my cool yeah
it lives inside of me eating whats in its way
i put black spray paint on my windows during the day
i want to spend time with it i think im losing it
or i found it and im using it
i wear my shades at night so i can look in the abyss
i see something in nothingness if you can picture this
put black holes in my jar lid i climb the wall
im too high now ill die from the fall
before the waters to our knees we cant climb when the trees
wash away you and i are the disease
