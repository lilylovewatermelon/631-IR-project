i stare at your pictures for hours on end
dreaming fantasizing about holding you
feeling my hands on your bare skin
just being with you
but i know itll never happen
but i cant stop myself from fantasizing
i think about you for hours until i realize how much time ive spent thinking of a scenario that will never happen
youre so beautiful and funny
and anytime i see your picture or even hear your name my stomach flips and i get butterflies
every word you say sends goosebumps all over my body
ive tried for so long not to look at you
to not look at pictures of you
to cut off all contact with you
but i cant stop it
i cant stop how i feel
i dont know if ill ever stop feeling this way
at least not for a long time
when i see you with him it makеs me sick to my stomach
and although that should put me off you it doesnt
it only makеs me want you more
if you knew how i felt i wouldnt even be writing this shit
i wouldnt be so lonely
youd understand how much you mean to me
you mean so much to me
i wish youd look at me the way i look at you
i wish i could be with you
i just want to feel the warmth of your body next to mine to see your smile
i want to play with your hair
see it shine under the sun as it hits you just right
i want to watch the sun sink behind the hills with you
talk bluff make up
anything
i just want anything from youyou might also like4embed"
