verse 1 drake
aww man fresh up out the sand february tan
its the boy but im still the man come and get your mans
i dont know first you caught the hands then you took the stand
its a joke but you say you real—i dont understand
on a yacht me and all the dogs actin like some dogs
we evolved used to think vacation meant niagara falls
swear to god shout to buffalo never duckin low
i dont stop man im stuck on go always hug the road
fuck a opp make his body roll yeah a lot of those

then i popped like you never seen we with everything
i went off in the 16 give me 17

all that shit embarrassin
tell your big homie im all for goin there again
he aint even die and i ball with his inheritance
all thats in my account at the bank of america
all that drake hysteria
6 side east side all that for my area
outro sandi graham
you know hun im a bit concerned about this negative tone that im hearing in your voice these days i can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and youre going to continue to feel alienated give some thought to this because i’m confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation im hearing in your tone these days when others go low we go high30embed"
