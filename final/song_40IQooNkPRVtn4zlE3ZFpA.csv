intro kendrick lamar
yeah yeah
young egypt
look look
verse kendrick lamar
i feel like pacino in godfather im charged
our father who art in heaven kendrick at large
came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
what an accomplishment broken promises
kept my focus anonymous till i dealt with the consequence
the greatest the latest mogul you know what time it is
you niggas fear me like yall fear god
you sound frantic i hear panic in your voice
just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin your bars
before you poke out your chest loosen your bra
before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital avenues lookin like evil dead zombies
with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin my stock rise
the salary the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
just premium gas do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
black excellence pessimist die countin my coin
hope its evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar on youth centers buildings and beamers and blue leather
forecastin my future this is the future
the mastermind until my next album more power to you
