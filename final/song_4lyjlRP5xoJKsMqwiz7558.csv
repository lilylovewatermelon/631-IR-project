if i wouldve knew the girl next door
wouldve been you
i wouldve been nice to you
a little more kind to you
i wouldve looked twice at you
if i wouldve knew the girl next door
wouldve been you
i probably wouldve shared my grub
depending on how close we was
by now we would be so in love

verse 1 musiq soulchild
girl im so surprised to see
the young fine woman that you grew up to be
your bodys banging like a 400se
even your attitude flows pleasantly
i remember when you was just tonya hall
a girl that likes to play basketball
as far as i was concerned you were one of my boys
i never cared about my sex or yours but

if i wouldve knew the girl next door

i wouldve looked twice at you
if i wouldve knew the girl next door
wouldve been you
i probably wouldve shared my grub
depending on how close we was
by now we would be so in love

im happy to see that youre home from school
and i wanna let you know that im proud of you
even when we was younger i admired you
thats why i used to always pick fights with you
i remember when we used to call each other names
mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
like i was your tarzan and you were my jane
can we do that nowadays

if i wouldve knew the boy next door wouldve been you
i wouldve been nice to you
spent a little time with you
i wouldve dressed cuter too
if i wouldve knew the boy next door
wouldve been you
i wouldve been on your team
when we played hide and seek
instead of you chasing me
bridge ayana  musiq soulchild
youre so fly now
girl stop playing
i didnt know you were that guy now
naw i aint
phat car phat life
impressed i am
oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby
