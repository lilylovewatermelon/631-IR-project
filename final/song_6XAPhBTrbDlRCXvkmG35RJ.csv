get into a fight just to make the sex better
you got a hold of me but there aint
nothing here thats holding you down
i believed in this except it wasnt getting better
you got me in the middle but i never found the center
even when you know what i know
its not stopping you now

i cant always see whats in front of me
no i can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
all over the ground

tell me when its over
wake me when im sober
the scars too hard to hide
i shouldve known better
if only i could be strong enough to see that its over
i wish id never met you
cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
where are you now
i shouldve known better

i got a new plan but it aint nothing but a mirror
of everything we had just before you became a winner
the love the lie is nothing but a memory now
you might also likei cant always see whats in front of me
no i can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
all over the ground

tell me when its over
wake me when im sober
the scars too hard to hide
i shouldve known better
if only i could be strong enough to see that its over
i wish id never met you
cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
where are you now
i shouldve known better

you take me for a ride and i dont even know the setup
get into a fight just to make the sex better
you got a hold of me but there aint
nothing here thats holding you down
i believed in this except it wasnt getting better
you got me in the middle but i never found the center
even when you know what i know
its not stopping you now

i cant always see whats in front of me
no i can hardly breathe suffocating me bleeding it out
all over the ground
tell me when its over
wake me when im sober
the scars too hard to hide
i shouldve known better
if only i could be strong enough to see that its over
i wish id never met you
cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
where are you now

tell me when its over
wake me when im sober
the scars too hard to hide
i shouldve known better
if only i could be strong enough to see that its over
i wish id never met you
cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
where are you now
i shouldve known better

so wake me when im sober
the scars too hard to hide
i shouldve known better
if only i could be strong enough to see that its over
i wish id never loved you
cause you were supposed to be coming back to me
where are you nowembed"
