hey
hey yeah

verse 1
its been too long
dont think ive seen you smile at me for quite a while
and were too busy doing things
we havent noticed whats missing
wheres the fun we used to have
my childish ways and your sarcasm
silly jokes and fairy tales where did we leave them
lost in the backyard ooh

chorus
your lasso my tiara
my wand your plastic bazooka
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
your cowboy hat my tutu
you hide and seek i catch you
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
in the backyard

verse 2
simple days of hand in hand and drawing our names in the sand
somehow life just complicates our buried treasure it just waits
lost in the backyard ooh
you might also likechorus
your lasso my tiara
my wand your plastic bazooka
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
your cowboy hat my tutu
you hide and seek i catch you
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
in the backyard

bridge
oh oh oh
in the backyard
lost in the backyard
lost you in the backyard
oh oh oh
in the backyard
you can still meet me in the garden you and i
and hide behind the roses bed
you and i you and i lost in the backyard again

chorus
your lasso my tiara
my wand your plastic bazooka
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
your cowboy hat my tutu
you hide and seek i catch you
why cant we be how we were in the backyard
in the backyardembed"
