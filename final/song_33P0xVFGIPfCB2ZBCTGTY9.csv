i lie awake on a long dark night
i cant seem to tame my mind
slings and arrows are killing me inside
maybe i cant accept the life thats mine
no maybe i cant accept the life thats mine
simple living is my desperate cry
been trading love with indifference
and yeah it suits me just fine
i try to hold on but im calloused to the bone
maybe thats why i feel alone yeah
maybe thats why i feel so alone

chorus
because me im rusted and weathered
barely holding together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
i am rusted and weathered
barely holding together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
no it just wont heal no no no

verse 2
the sun shines and i cant avoid the light
i think im holding on to life too tight
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
sometimes i feel like giving up yeah
i said sometimes i feel like giving up

because me im rusted and weathered
barely holdin together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
i am rusted and weathered
barely holding together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
it just wont heal no

verse 3
the day reminds me of you
the night hides your truth
the earth is a voice
speaking to you
take all this pride
and leave it behind
because one day it ends
one day we die
believe what you will
that is your right
but i choose to win
i choose to fight to fight

chorus
because me im rusted and weathered
barely holding together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
i am rusted and weathered
barely holding together
im covered with skin that peels
and it just wont heal
no it just wont heal no no no

outro
covered with skin that peels
and it just wont
covered with skin that peels
and it just wont healembed"
