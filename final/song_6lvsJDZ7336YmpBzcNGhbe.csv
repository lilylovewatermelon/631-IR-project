this love is tainted
i need you and i hate it
youre caught between a dream and a movie scene
in a way you know what i mean

when the dark turns to mist i just cant resist it

chorus
cause im a fool for you
and the things you do
im a fool for you
and the things the things you do
the things you do
the things you do

when youre lookin like this
i just cant resist it
i know sometimes i hide it but i cant this time

but you wont believe me believe me

chorus
cause im a fool for you
and the things you do
im a fool for you
and the things the things you do
you might also likebridge
