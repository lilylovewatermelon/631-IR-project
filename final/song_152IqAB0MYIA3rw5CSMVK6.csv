dont act like yall didnt know this wasnt comin
alright

verse 1
you know tommy gonna trick his truck jack it up big time
lift kit chrome tips spit shinin like a diamond
game change when the rain came and we took it down a back road
georgia clay mud hole thats how these boys roll
now its late night underneath the moonlight
everybodys feelin right and sippin on a bud light
go on drop your tailgate turn up your radio
ima build a bonfire you can make yourself at home

interlude
kick back relax you know we just a bunch of hillbillies
tip back your cup of jack and throw your hands up with me

chorus
hey we might look a little crazy tonight
but hey baby thats alright
its our backwoods boondock roots
its just what we do its just what we do
hey aint no way to make this up
when its runnin through your blood
there aint no hidin the truth
its just what we do its just what we do
yeah its just a what we do

and if you play your hand right you wont have to go home alone

and when the moments right grab your phone and get them digits
