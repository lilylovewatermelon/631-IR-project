said i was in my early 40s
with a lot of life before me
when a moment came that stopped me on a dime
i spent most of the next days lookin at the xrays
talkin bout the options and talkin bout sweet time
asked him when it sank in
that this might really be the real end
hows it hit ya when you get that kind of news
man what ya do
and he says

chorus 1
i went sky divin
i went rocky mountain climbin
i went 27 seconds on a bull named fu manchu
and i loved deeper
and i spoke sweeter
and i gave forgiveness ive been denying
and he said someday i hope you get the chance
to live like you were dyin

verse 2
he said i was finally the husband
that most the time i wasnt
and i became a friend a friend would like to have
and all the sudden goin fishing
wasnt such an imposition
and i went three times that year i lost my dad
well i finally read the good book
and i took a good long hard look at what id do
if i could do it all again
and then

to live like you were dyin

bridge
like tomorrow was a gift and youve got eternity
to think about what you do with it
what could you do with it what can
i do with with it what would i do with it

chorus 2
sky divin
i went rocky mountain climbin
i went 27 seconds on a bull named fu manchu
and i loved deeper
and i spoke sweeter
and i watched an eagle as it was flying
and he said someday i hope you get the chance
to live like you were dyin
outro
to live like you were dyin
to live like you were dyin
to live like you were dyin
to live like you were dyin14embed"
