when i first came to this island
that i called by my own name
i was happy in this fortress
in my exile i remained
but the hours grew so empty
and the ocean sent her waves
in the figure of a woman
she pulled me out to sea

chorus
when you come down to take me home
send my soul away
when you come round youll make me whole
send my soul away

verse 2
on the altar of a sunrise
was a wedding in the waves
and inside her shone a young light
from her labor i was saved
though ive traveled long in darkness
in her harvest im embraced

chorus
when you come down to take me home
send my soul away
when you come round youll make me whole
send my soul away

now the spires and the gables
grow in orchards to the sky
and the blessings on my table
multiply and divide

chorus
when you come down to take me home
send my soul away
when you come round youll make me whole
send my soul away

outro
yeah when you come down to take me home
when you come round youll make me whole
yeah when you come down to take me home
send my soul away
send my soul away
send my soul away
send my soul awayembed"
