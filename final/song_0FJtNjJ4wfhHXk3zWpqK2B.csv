ive seen a man cry
ive seen a man shoutout
afraid of losing the woman he loves
ive seen a woman lying
to her man flat out
about who shes been with
and where she was
ive seen them both fight
and try to figure it out
this fight isnt going anywhere
ive seen a childs eyes
watching his parents freak out
i know they see him but they just dont care

prechorus
it wont stop if they dont stop yelling
its not the way of working your problems out
i cant stand being around this yelling
so im finding my way out

chorus
im gonna drive and never ever slow down
im gonna drive until i breakdown
packing my things and getting out of this town
im gonna drive until i breakdown

ive seen a childs eyes
ive seen him living in doubt
not ever knowing what its like to be in love
ive seen his friends try
and just help him get out
he never told them what the problem really was
ive seen a suicide
they couldnt figure it out
he blamed himself because they couldnt get along
ive seen his parents eyes
trying to figure it out
where did our baby go and what went wrong

prechorus
it wont stop if they dont stop yelling
its not the way of working your problems out
i cant stand being around this yelling
so im finding my way out

chorus
im gonna drive and never ever slow down
im gonna drive until i breakdown
packing my things and getting out of this town
im gonna drive until i breakdown
im gonna drive until i breakdown
hold it inside until i breakdown
not gonna try until i break down
say my goodbyes until i breakdown
baby come on
im gonna drive and never ever slow down
im gonna drive until i breakdown
packing my things and getting out of this town
im gonna drive until i breakdown
im gonna drive and never ever slow down
im gonna drive until i breakdown
packing my things and getting out of this town
im gonna drive until i breakdown
im gonna drive until i breakdown
hold it inside until i breakdownembed"
