dont want to stand in line
dont want to fall behind
dont want to get caught out
dont want to do without
and the lesson i must learn
is that ive got to wait my turn

looks like i got to be hot and cold
i got to be taught and told
got to be good as gold
but perfectly honestly oh
i think it would be good for me
cause its a hindrance to my health
that im a stranger to myself

miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
bring me to my knees
well i must be my own master
or a miniature disaster will be
it will be the death of me

i dont have to raise my voice
dont have to be underhand
just got to understand
that its gonna be up and down
its gonna be lost and found
and i cant take to the sky
before i like it on the ground
you might also likeand i need to be patient
and i need to be brave
need to discover
how i need to behave
and ill find out the answers
when i know what to ask
but i speak a different language
and everybodys talking too fast

miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
bring me to my knees

well i must be my own master
or a miniature disaster will be will be  oh
ive got to run a little faster
or a miniature disaster will be will be  oh
i need to know ill last if a little
or a miniature disaster will be will be  oh
miniature disaster hits me
it could be the death of meembed"
