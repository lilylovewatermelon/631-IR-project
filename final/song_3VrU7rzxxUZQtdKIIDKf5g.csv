for all you people fo sho
and maybe some should consider
a place thats open till 4

lights go down and youre ready for the open road

when its time to come home

realize that im gonna be the one who
takes your hand while were walkin through the avenue

and then your so far away from here
to be on your own
and then your so far away from here
to be all alone

never had a reason or a will to deceive you girl

never really know and if youll be on the other side
when its time to come home

realize that im gonna be the one who
takes your hand while were walkin through the avenue
oh im your man i wanna take your
oh im your man whose gonna make you
