tell me what im supposed to do
with all these left over feelings of you
cause i dont know

when all these nightmares become real
cause i dont know

and i dont know how we separate the lies here from the truth
and i dont know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
exactly what were supposed to do

so leave me at the roadside
and hang me up and out to dry
so leave me at the roadside
and hang me up and out to dry

and i dont know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
exactly what were supposed to do

chorus
so leave me at the roadside
and hang me up and out to dry
so leave me at the roadside
and hang me up and out to dry
