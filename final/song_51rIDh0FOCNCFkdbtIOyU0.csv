were you honest when you said
i could never leave your bed
wake me up and let me know youre alive
and will you fall in love again
is the scent slowly spreading
ive been answering machines all night
now the doctors dancing in
while the ambulances sing
another boy without a sharper knife

chorus
the moment thats where i
kill the conversation wrap this up
with a knife that loves to feel
how do you know how deep to go before its real

verse 2
take me home
can i even complicate your breathing
i guess im just your average boy
this is me with a knife in the back
and a grip on the grass
its cold and i dont want to be here
i guess im never comfortable or situational
are we losing or beginning
to try a new life without you
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
the moment thats where i
kill the conversation wrap this up
with a lie that im enjoying every minute with myself

verse 3
and she could make hell feel just like home
so im never leaving her alone
but if your lightning lips arent mine
then i dont know the awkward stranger to my right
but shes crying
i only need one hand to drive when youre with me
you are my getaway
oh no

bridge
and dont you ever feel alone
and dont you wish you were home
cut the lust tonight
alright alright tell me why
my little mona lisa told a lie lie lie lie

outro
do you want me
do you want to let me know that youre okay
a diamond gold ring
customized to cut your circulation
but i couldnt let you go
no i never let you go my dear
so keep talking cause i love to hear your voice
to hear your voice to hear your voice again12embed"
