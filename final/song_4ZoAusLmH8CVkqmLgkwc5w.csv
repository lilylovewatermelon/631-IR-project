she called last night still waiting for a reply
this static contact pulling us apart
please hang on tight iâ€™ll see you through the night

prechorus casey calvert jt woodruff both
yeah
you have me still because im breathing
although it has slowed down
please dont cry because im leaving
i hope i see you soon

instrumental chorus

verse 2 jt woodruff with casey calvert
exchange the sunshine for brown eyes and dark skies
replace this dull life with you
i know its tomorrow shes waiting for something to feel alive

chorus jt woodruff
you know me too well
shes sorry and i can tell
scene missing fade to black
youre acting all this out again

verse 3 jt woodruff matt rideour
just wake me when its over when the curtains raise
its time to move on
exit now credits rolling the girl who stole my heart
the one that got away the one that got away
