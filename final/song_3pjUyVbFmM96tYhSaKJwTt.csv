verse 1 j cole ari lennox  j cole  ari lennox
yeah my intuition is telling me therell be better days
i sit in silence and find whenever i meditate
my fears alleviate my tears evaporate mmm
my faith dont deviate ideas dont have a date
but see im growing and getting stronger with every breath mmm
bringing me closer to heavens doors with every step mmm
as we speak im at peace no longer scared to die
most niggas dont believe in god and so they terrified
its either that or they be fearing they gon go to hell
asking the father for forgiveness got em overwhelmed
mmm please god i want to go to heaven
as if hes spiteful like them white folks that control the jail mmm
see i believe if god is real hed never judge a man
because he knows us all and therefore he would understand mmm
the ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
the bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife  mmm like

chorus j cole j cole  ari lennox  ari lennox

but the only real change come from inside

but the only real change come from— ooh
in cemeteries or in chains i see men cry
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from— ooh oh woah

prodigal son got a new gun this one
dont run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
can i ball become a star and remain myself myself
if i fall dust it off and regain myself myself

i reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands ooh
all of a sudden niggas poppin trunk and then we scram mmm
finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
what its like to finally be the motherfuckin man ooh yeah
eyes wide thats from the power that the coward feels
niggas die over bitches disrespect and dollar bills ooh
bloodshed done turned the city to a battlefield mmm
i call it poison you call it real thats how you feel
poppoppoppoppoppop
verse 4 j cole
pistols be poppin and niggas drop in a heartbeat
scattered like roaches a body laid on the concrete
lets go lets go lets go lets go body laid on the concrete
look somebody laid on the concrete
no time for that aint no lookin back cause im running too
i made it home i woke up and turned on the morning news
overcame with a feeling i cant explain
cause that was my nigga james that was slain he was twentytwo
last night at around 745 he was twentytwo
twentytwo year old black male suspect reporting on the news

outro j cole
i swear to god bruh no
were gathered here today
i swear to god
to mourn the life of james mcmillan jr no
i swear to god—nigga ima kill them niggas man
a tragedy another tragedy in the black community
i promise you bro
we got to do better people
twentytwo years old this boy was too young oh my god
i promise you bro ima kill them niggas
our condolences go to his family our prayers
ima kill them niggas myself
we know hes in a better place
we know hes in a better place
but this has got to end ladies and gentlemen
weve got to come together this is—this is beyond words ima kill them niggas
now id like to open this ceremony with a verse from—113embed"
