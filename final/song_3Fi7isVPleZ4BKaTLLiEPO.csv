i drive in the rain
with the window open
but its not the same
when everything has changed
but while your still near
ill try anything
and ill say all the things that you said you wanted to hear

chorus
but the words inside my head
are better left unsaid
to lie like the ghosts beneath my bed oh yeah
dont you know that i go crazy
but ive nothing left to give
though ill miss you for a while
dont you know that i go crazy
but youre on your own tonight
though you know ill miss your smile

verse 2
you you cant take back
half of what you give
and you wont remember
half the life youve lived
but while youre still here
ill do anything
and ill say all the things that you said you needed to hear
you might also likechorus
dont you know that i go crazy
but ive nothing left to give
though ill miss you for a while
dont you know that i go crazy
but youre on your own tonight
though you know ill miss your smile

bridge
the words inside my head
are better than the words ive said
as always

chorus
dont you know that i go crazy
but ive nothing left to give
though ill miss you for a while
dont you know that i go crazy
but youre on your own tonight
though you know ill miss your smile

outro
dont you know that i go crazy
though you know ill miss your smileembed"
