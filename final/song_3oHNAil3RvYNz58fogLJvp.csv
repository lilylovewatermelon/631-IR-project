put up your hands girl but not so pushy
if you wanna be comin and makin sweet love to me
and if youre the type of girl that do anything to please
maybe then i realize you aint got what i need
to keep my soul alright
it keeps me up high above
yes me got the reason to come question your love
it keeps my soul alright
it keeps me up high above
want me girly to come give me some sweet lovin
and in the morning time she makes me feel alright
then me gotta be waitin till the day turns to night
cause in the evening time she makes me feel alright
girl you got me wishin this would happen every night

chorus
said if you want to get with me
girl this is what youll find
but a man whos got the type of moves to make you lose your mind
you tell me that your love is true on each and every day
you tell me that youve got that type of lovin here to stay
sweet honey

verse 2
you see me laughin cause its kinda funny to me
the way she say she never give her lovin for free
she say she got a man why she lookin at me
yes she want a lover with the sensitivity ya
but wont you tell me that your loves from the heart
yes the type of lovin that can tear mine apart
girl you got to realize before it ever starts
yes i am the man who wont come breakin your heart
