you know i want you
its not a secret i try to hide
i know you want me
so dont keep sayin our hands are tied
you claim its not in the cards
and fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
but youre here in my heart
so who can stop me if i decide that youre my destiny

chorus zac efron
what if we rewrite the stars
say you were made to be mine
nothing could keep us apart
youd be the one i was meant to find
its up to you and its up to me
no one can say what we get to be
so why dont we rewrite the stars
maybe the world could be ours tonight

verse 2 zendaya
you think its easy
you think i dont want to run to you
but there are mountains
and there are doors that we cant walk through
i know youre wonderin why
because were able to be just you and me within these walls
but when we go outside
youre gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
you might also likechorus zendaya
no one can rewrite the stars
how can you say youll be mine
everything keeps us apart
and im not the one you were meant to find
its not up to you its not up to me
when everyone tells us what we can be
how can we rewrite the stars
say that the world can be ours tonight

bridge both zendaya zac efron
all i want is to fly with you
all i want is to fall with you
so just give me all of you
it feels impossible
its not impossible
is it impossible
say that its possible

chorus both zac efron
how do we rewrite the stars
say you were made to be mine
nothing can keep us apart
cause you are the one i was meant to find
its up to you and its up to me
no one can say what we get to be
why dont we rewrite the stars
changin the world to be ours
outro zendaya
you know i want you
its not a secret i try to hide
but i cant have you
were bound to break and my hands are tied93embed"
