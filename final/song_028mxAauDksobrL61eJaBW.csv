fuck

verse 1
another turnin point a fork stuck in the road
time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go
so make the best of this test and dont ask why
its not a question but a lesson learned in time

chorus
its somethin unpredictable but in the end is right
i hope you had the time of your life

verse 2
so take the photographs and still frames in your mind
hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
for what its worth it was worth all the while

chorus
its somethin unpredictable but in the end is right
i hope you had the time of your life
violin solo

chorus
its something unpredictable but in the end is right
i hope you had the time of your life
its something unpredictable but in the end is right
i hope you had the time of your lifesee green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also like74embed"
