me and candice waking up to a heat wave
mothers in the garden inviting everyone
ooh we cut up our old jeans and go outside
neighbours always smiling with the baby on her knee
rhea sat on the front step getting her hair combed out and greased
music the bass boomin from the car parked in the street
got that new song on repeat oh oh

id id like to put my fingers on you
id id like to paint a picture for you
sometimes you dont understand where im coming from
i just like to make you see that
i desire the simple things

growing up we didnt have a lot of money
used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
plastic cups for rum and punch
eating chicken thats hot and sweet
all the women discussing what love is like
ooh you know the way i mean
and im just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
got that new song on repeat oh oh

id id like to put my fingers on you
id id like to paint a picture for you
sometimes you dont understand where im coming from
im just trying to make you see that
i desire the simple things

id id like to put my fingers on you
id id like to paint this picture for you
sometimes you dont understand where im coming from
i just like to make you see that
i desire the simple things
id id like to put my fingers on you
id id like to paint a picture for you
sometimes you dont understand where im coming from
i just like to make you see that
