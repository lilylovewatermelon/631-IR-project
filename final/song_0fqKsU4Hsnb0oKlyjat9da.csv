how many times have i called you
while you were working just to say
left messages on your answer machine
about 3 or 4 times a day

hook
there arent many more ways in words that i can say
so ill just say numerically
from my heart to you  onefourthree

verse 2
so many times ive bought roses
just to see that smile on your face
i cant remember how many emails i sent you
just to tell you bout my day

hook
there arent many more ways in words that i can say
so ill just say numerically
from my heart to you  onefourthree

bridge
girl you know you are so special to me
and you deserve to be treated exclusively
see musiq soulchild liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeverse 3
i treat you like valentines day 365 a year
make sure that everything you need will always be right here
now i just refuse to be your typical ordinary run of the mill
garden variety lover
ooh oh oh

verse 4
ill make sure everyday you live will be like christmas eve
i wanna make you feel fine just like a summer breeze
cause i refuse to be your predictable average run of the mill
garden variety love
ohh ohh oh

verse 5
see sometimes words may get in the way
of things that you really really meant to say
so i wanna take out this time to
make sure that how i really feel gets through to you
cause listen
there arent many more ways and words that i can say
so i choose to tell you how i feel in a numerical way
got so tired of trying to find the most complicated way
to say it to you so i simplified and broke it down
to onefourthree  and that means i love you
sugar you know yeah yeah yeah yeah
