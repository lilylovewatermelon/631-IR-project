big orange ball sinking in the water
toes in the sand couldnt get much hotter
little umbrella shaped margaritas
coconut oil tanning señoritas
now i know how jimmy buffet feels

hands on the wheel cruising down the interstate
gas pedal sticks carries my car away
i was going as fast as a rambler goes
i could feel the speed from my head to my toes
now i know how richard petty feels

chorus
ive been around the block a time or two
done almost everything a boy can do
ive done some living yeah ive had fun
but there is one thing that i havent done

verse 2
saved two months bought a little diamond
tonight’s the night feels like perfect timing
down on one knee on mommas front steps
man im going to die if she really says yes
i want to know how forever feels
