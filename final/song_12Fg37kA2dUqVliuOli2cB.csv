well i grew up wild and free
walking these fields in my barefeet
there wasnt no place i couldnt go
with a 22 rifle and a fishin pole

chorus
well i live in the city but dont fit in
you know its a pity the shape im in
well i got no home and i got no choice
oh lord have mercy on a country boy

verse 2
when i was young i remember well
id hunt the wild turkey and bobwhite quail
the river was clear and deep back then
had fishin lines tied to the willow limb

chorus
well i live in the city but dont fit in
you know its a pity the shape im in
well i got no home and i got no choice
oh lord have mercy on a country boy

verse 3
well they damned the river they damned the stream
they cut down the cyprus and the sweetgum trees
theres a laundromat and a barbershop
and now the whole meadow is a parking lot
