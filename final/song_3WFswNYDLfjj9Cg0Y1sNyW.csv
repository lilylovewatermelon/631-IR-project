turn the lights on

verse 1
every night i rush to my bed
with hopes that maybe ill get a chance
to see you when i close my eyes
im goin out of my head
lost in a fairy tale
can you hold my hands and be my guide

prechorus
clouds filled with stars cover your skies
and i hope it rains
youre the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this

chorus
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i dont wanna wake up from you turn the lights on
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me your loves too good to be true turn the lights on
my guilty pleasure i aint goin nowhere
baby long as youre here ill be floatin on air cause youre mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i dont wanna wake up from you turn the lights on

i mention you when i say my prayers
i wrap you around all of my thoughts
boy you my temporary high
i wish that when i wake up youre there
to wrap your arms around me for real
and tell me youll stay by my side

prechorus
clouds filled with stars cover the skies cover the skies
and i hope it rains
youre the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this

chorus
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i dont wanna wake up from you turn the lights on
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me your loves too good to be true turn the lights on
my guilty pleasure i aint goin nowhere
baby long as youre here ill be floatin on air cause youre mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i dont wanna wake up from you turn the lights on

tattoo your name across my heart
so it will remain
not even death could make us part
what kind of dream is this
chorus
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i dont wanna wake up from you turn the lights on
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me your loves too good to be true turn the lights on
my guilty pleasure i aint goin nowhere

you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
