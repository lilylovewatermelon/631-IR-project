verse 1
lately youve been busy wondering if you miss me
why did you go against me i just wanna know
how come you act so different talk to me ill listen
all the love im giving dont act like you dont know

prechorus
i was out there on the road life out of control
she became a victim to my busy schedule
and i know that its not fair that dont mean that i dont care
this ones dedicated to the girl out there

chorus
girl you always catch me at the bad time bad time
when i know you probably think its a lie a lie
i know i told you last time was the last time last time
how could you pull the plug and leave me flatline flatline
flatline flatline flatline flatline
how could you pull the plug and leave me flatline ohoh
cause when i hit you you dont even reply reply
how could you pull the plug and leave me flatline
