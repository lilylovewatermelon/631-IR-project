a long time ago
there was a story
im sure you all know

im sure you remember
and i know you believe
the story of adam and eve

in the garden of eden
where life began
yes the very beginning
of woman and man

im sure you remember
and i know you believe
the story of adam and eve

there within the garden
was they both fell in love
sheltered by the guiding hand
of the one above

life was filled with happiness
until one day arose
a very great temptation
well you know how it goes
