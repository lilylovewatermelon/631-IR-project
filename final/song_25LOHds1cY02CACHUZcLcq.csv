i got a good bull rope
i got a brand new bell
i got a hotrod pickup truck she can really set sail
pushing that red line gotta make that show
gonna meet my buddies at the rodeo

verse 2
i just drew myself a mean old bull
were all smellin money cause the jackpots full
hes got fire in his belly and he turns back quick
son this big devil got a bag of tricks

chorus
gimme eight more seconds
gimme one more shot
gimme hell below but gimme strength on top
gotta be crazy gotta be insane
to hitch your wagon to a hurricane

verse 3
im gonna wrap my rope around my glove real tight
im dropping my hooks down im ready to ride
say a little prayer give my nod and go
stay clean in the middle til i hear that whistle blow
