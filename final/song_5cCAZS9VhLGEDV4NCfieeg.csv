lately ive been stuck imagining
what i wanna do and what i really think
time to blow out

cause i know that everybodys thinking it
when the lights out

shame on me
to need release
unununcontrollably

i got running through my mind woah

verse 2
lately people got me all tied up
theres a countdown waiting for me to erupt
time to blow out
ive been told just what to do with it
to keep both my hands above the blanket
when the lights out
