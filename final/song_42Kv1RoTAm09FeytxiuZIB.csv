my knife its sharp and chrome
come see inside my bones
all the fiends are on the block
im the new king i taste the queen
cause in here we are all anemic
in here anemic and sweet so

chorus
go get your knife go get your knife
and come in
go get your knife go get your knife
and lay down
go get your knife go get your knife
now kiss me

verse 2
i can float here forever
in this room we cant touch the floor
in here were all anemic
in here anemic and sweet so

chorus
go get your knife go get your knife
and come in
go get your knife go get your knife
and lay down
go get your knife go get your knife
now kiss me

i could float here forever
anemic and sweet
i could float here forever
anemic and sweet so

chorus
go get your knife go get your knife
and come in

and lay down
