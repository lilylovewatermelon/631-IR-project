darker than the east river larger than the empire state
where the beast who guard the barbed wire gate
is on the job—not my fate tired of the wait
til the villain bring deliverance from the dire straits
fire at a higher rate why debate the liars
fliers scatter buy a plate—isolate the wires
try the straight pliers if not—the vice grips
a real pricesaver way to acquire nice whips
what a steal for real on wheels of steel
stunner a funner summer numberone meal dealbummer
a bizarre phenomenon—is your armor on
take your cash karma or break your fast—ramadan
transaction drama—aw come on barney
clack clack—pardon me whack rap con carne
he came to feed the childrens like sally struthers
after that hes going back to cali wheres the——love is—
wilder than the nile hold power like the great pyramids
of giza and stay leanin like the tower of pisa
give him something he can feel thats soft to squeeza
raw with the pen and on the mic—off the hezza
get shot off that wideeyed talk
and if he had a pot hed still piss on the sidewalk
cant take the street out the streetperson
lookin for the perfect beat coercion into heatburstin
they couldnt spot him on the spot date
got the only tape that come with a free hotplate
whoever do get to see me sing
with the 3 dring sittin stationary like bb king
can see how it really sting it aint no front row
standing room only at the motocross stunt show
the ruckus aint up to snuffleupagus
me and sub is like the brown smothers brothers my love is—
vaster than the seven seas bigger than mount kilimanjaro
if they dont know fill em in tomorrow
on the horror show a mental note return bob’s record
swear to god before he gets a job he robs an eckerd
blessed with a hot flow tested it got dough
invested in stress the best to finesse an opto
as i reminisce never forgot when i was very broke
shot the henny straight couldnt afford to cop the cherry coke
or should i say broke with wealth
to know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self
plan b before i take the ring and pawn it
the long arm of the law couldnt even put they fingers on it
doggone it do the statistics
how he bust lyrics its too futuristic for ballistics
and far too eccentric for forensics
i dedicate this mix to subroc the hiphop hendrix
you might also likeoutro sample  mf doom
in my pocket a note 
its—from my father
—from the guards whip is this a trick
why would i resort to trickery youre already a prisoner what do i gain by deceiving you
you cant blame me for being suspicious
no
hehe
