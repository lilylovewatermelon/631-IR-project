you spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
if youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
youre sleeping youre sleeping

verse 1
you make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
and pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
but you feel like even though you got everything in the world
you got nothing
so what you do then is you start going backwards
you runnin in a direction
and you lookin for something that isnt real
and all you know is that you just gotta have it
what youre doin is sleepin
and thinking that youre awake and youre not
and the problem is that you dont know what youre after
so you put everything that you have into what you do
hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
but as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
then you look back and you start to regret things
you only get one life
and every time you lookin at yours
you feel like everything you have is a waste
and the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
is because you were never awake

verse 2
you wake up in the morning
but you feel like you never got up and go to work
and you feelin like you aint got a purpose
and you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
like you aint nothing but worthless
and yo you look around
a lot of these other people you lookin at
to you you describe as perfect
so you point a finger at god and tell him to do his job
and fix ya life up cause nothin is workin
and you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
but really you feel like everything is crashin around you
and you developed a problem in trusting in other people
which later became an issue that would mentally pound you
you only get one life
but every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
and the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
is because you were never awake
wake up
