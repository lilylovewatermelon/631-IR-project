get so caught up everyday
trying to keep it all together
while the time just slips away
see i know nothing lasts forever

prechorus
imagine there was no tomorrow
imagine that i couldnt see your face
thered be no limit to my sorrow
so all i can say

chorus
i wanna tell you something give you something
show you in so many ways
cause it would all mean nothing if i dont say something
before it all goes away
dont wanna wait to bring you flowers
waste another hour let alone another day

wont wait til its too late

postchorus
