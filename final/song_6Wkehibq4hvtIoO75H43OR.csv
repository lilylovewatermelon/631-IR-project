verse 1 childish gambino
who am i
rec league i aint paying to ball
yall bstring like a broke guitar
and i still put it down like the family dog
yeah i murder some murder one
explain it all ferguson
we aint gotta sing the same old love song
cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
yeah what you saying to it
old money look no money dont do it
make em turn around in their lane like a uie
and im only looking back if im looking at her booty
at her booty whats the rationale
they wanna smoke niggas when they black and mild
so we act it out—okay cool
