a year from now well all be gone
all our friends will move away
and theyre goin to better places
but our friends will be gone away
nothin is as it has been
and i miss your face like hell
and i guess its just as well
but i miss your face like hell

been talkin bout the way things change
and my family lives in a different state

then we will not relate
so if you dont know what to make of this
then we will not relate
