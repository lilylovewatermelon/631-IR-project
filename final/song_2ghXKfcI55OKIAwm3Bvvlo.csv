you in the morning time
reminds me of the summertime
and any time that aint right now
seems to be a waste of time
the way the grass fills hills or the holler
and the sun gives in to the crescent moon
the way im givin in tomorrow
makin love in the afternoon

chorus
cause when you go down hard
you come up swingin
i fucking hate love
but i love you in the evenings
i swore youd be here
when i finally woke
i love you in the evеnings
but i fucking hate high hopes

verse 2
you in the morning timе
reminds me of a simpler time
cuttin grass for cash and gasoline
to prove im worth your touch and time
the way a womans hands are warfare
to a wise mans worn out ways
the way i figured i was worthless
when i lost a love that shouldve stayed

cause when you go down hard
you come up swingin
i fucking hate love
but i love you in the evenings
i swore youd be here
when i finally woke
i love you in the evenings
but i fucking hate high hopes

verse 3
you in the morning time
reminds me that each day is mine
to be grateful for the rising sun
sneakin through the window blind
the way you tell me its alright
the past has passed and right nows arrived
you in the morning time
makes me glad im still aliveembed"
