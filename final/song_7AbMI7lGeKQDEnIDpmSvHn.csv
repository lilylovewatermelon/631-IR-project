how can they say
that it’s one way
when it’s the opposite
and how can they know
the end of the story
before i tell it
‘cause when i walk
your feet they fall
to the same beat
or maybe we’re from two different worlds
but weve got our own language

prechorus
we talk to people
but they never understand
they think we’re crazy
‘cause it sounds like noise

chorus
when we’re speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
we’re speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
see paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also likeverse 2
we used to live
like we were strangers
we didn’t know any better
we didn’t fit
in with the out crowd
so we gave in
and we shut our mouths
but oh i love your history
and i can take it
and when you talk in code to me
i can translate it

prechorus
we talk to people
but they never understand
they think we’re crazy
‘cause it sounds like noise to them
aint it strange
all the things you hear
when you sit
and listen

chorus
when we’re speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
we’re speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
postchorus
and all this time ive been wasting my breath
just wasting my words on everyone else
now speaking in my native
speaking in my native tongue

bridge
so come on
talk it out
so come on
talk it out
so come on
and talk talk talk talk talk
talk it out
your voice it brought me back from the dead somehow
so come on
and talk talk talk talk talk
talk it out

break
out
out
out

chorus
speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
we’re speaking in our native
speaking in our native tongue
outro
and all this time ive been wasting my breath
just wasting my words on everyone else
