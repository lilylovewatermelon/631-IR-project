i got a date with the night
burning out my finger
gonna catch the kids dry
gonna walk on water
buying out the fight
were sweating in the winter
both thighs squeeze tight

hook
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke

verse 2
dont tell me to fix her
dont tell me to fix her
just take a bite
no hanging no picture
flying out my sight
dropping brides at the altar
both thighs squeeze tight

hook
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke
choke choke choke

verse 3
buying out the fight
gonna walk on water
gonna catch the kids dry
gonna bend my finger
buying out my fight
were sweating in the winter
both thighs squeeze tight
both thighs squeeze tight2embed"
