dont get me wrong
i like a bobber on the water
hookin em and reelin em in
i like a friday night slow ride
brooks  dunn bside
hit rewind spin it again
i like a strong shot of whiskey
the way a marlboro hits me
some broken in cowboy boots

chorus
but im in love and lovin on you
i feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
i cant get enough of you honey
youre right on the money
im a junkie for your midnight moves
im in love and lovin on you

verse 2
i like a sunrise duck blind
birdie on a par 5
miller lite before noon
i like a twodoor old ford
wood board back porch
three chords and the truth
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
but im in love and lovin on you
i feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
i cant get enough of you honey
youre right on the money
im a junkie for your midnight moves
im in love with lovin on you

chorus
girl im in love and lovin on you
i feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
i cant get enough of you honey
youre right on the money
im a junkie for your midnight moves
im in love and lovin on you
im in love and lovin on you2embed"
