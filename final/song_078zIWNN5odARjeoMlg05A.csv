are we all victims of opportunity
locked outside the door back in 83
i heard the angry voice of the man inside
and saw the look of fear in my mothers eyes

chorus tom delonge  mark hoppus
go go go go
go go go go i dont wanna know i dont wanna know

verse 2 mark hoppus
mom get in the car and lets drive away
she said im sorry mark but theres nowhere to stay
gave up all her hope and went back inside
hid her broken heart and let the engine die

chorus tom delonge  mark hoppus
go go go go
go go go go i dont wanna know i dont wanna know

verse 3 mark hoppus
why do evil men get away with it
cant you see that im in a world of shit
turn your back on hope and go back inside
stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

i dont wanna know i dont wanna know

go go go go i dont wanna know i dont wanna know
