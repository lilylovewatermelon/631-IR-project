you played me for a fool
and i played the part so well
you played it smart you played it cool
broke every promise every rule
and i couldnt even tell

verse 2
you looked me in the eyes
and said i was the only one
it was no surprise
that i kept falling for your lies
and they had only just begun

chorus
fool me once shame on you
you told me that you would be true
you were so easy to believe
fool me twice shame on me

verse 3
i thought id won your heart
but you were still in love with him
you said wed never be apart
it was a lie right from the start
you left me hanging on this limb
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 4
i never thought that you could be
the kind to hurt me just for fun
but its sure no fun for me
i think its time to set you free
pick myself up and say were done

chorus
fool me once shame on you
you told me that you would be true
you were so easy to believe
fool me twice shame on me

outro
you were so easy to believe
fool me twice shame on meembed"
