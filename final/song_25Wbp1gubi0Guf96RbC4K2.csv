someone told me long ago
theres a calm before the storm i know

shining down like water

i wanna know have you ever seen the rain
i wanna know have you ever seen the rain
coming down on a sunny day

yesterday and days before
sun is cold and rain is hard i know
been that way for all my time
til forever on it goes
through the circle fast and slow i know
and it cant stop i wonder

chorus
i wanna know have you ever seen the rain
i wanna know have you ever seen the rain
coming down on a sunny day
