where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
i tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love i wish i understood
it used to be so nice it used to be so good

chorus
so when youre near me darling cant you hear me sos
the love you gave me nothing else can save me sos
when youre gone how can i even try to go on
when youre gone though i try how can i carry on

verse 2
you seem so far away though you are standing near
you made me feel alive but something died i fear
i really tried to make it out i wish i understood
what happened to our love it used to be so good

chorus
so when youre near me darling cant you hear me sos
the love you gave me nothing else can save me sos
when youre gone how can i even try to go on
when youre gone though i try how can i carry on

so when youre near me darling cant you hear me sos
and the love you gave me nothing else can save me sos
when youre gone how can i even try to go on

when youre gone how can i even try to go on
when youre gone though i try how can i carry on8embed"
