dtp we got them guns that go
gunshots

verse 1 i20
yea im all about that pistol player cold blooded killer
niggas recognize my name i dub the young dealer

ill shoot up yall white shirts until you all look like dice
but im through with all the talking time to show all you niggas
i 20 im like jlo blowing through niggas damn
dtp we aint playing if you try to get our pay
and them aks get to spraying like
bottom line that mean im bout it any nigga want it doubt it
bust you in the broad day on a street thats fully crowded
you’ll find a hole inside your chest just for thinking its rap
so tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
chaka say im shot out and i tend to agree
so you should watch what you saying if its intended for me
so be careful what you starting let my fingers do the walking
and that uzi get to talking like gun sound

verse 2 2 chainz
hammers jam em snatch em grab em

bake him take him beat him up i hate a hater i eat him up
abcdef shawty is you a g or what
now its just me and my nuts thats all i got in this world
im pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like hurl
serving the club head shot scattered covered run scram em
im 38 hot with a pearl handle
and im throwing techs like a nba ref
i got all gold guns like they came from iraq
artillery could it be i got all kinds of these pistols
i point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
and they aint taking no more pictures if you snap imma click
anyway plus i got bullets in the clip the size of lil fate
and im waving choppers like helicopters

y’all  cowards play tough and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
y’all  lives made up like ugly hoes with makeup bra
well shoot you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
my wrist rocky like sylvester stallone
so therefore you should invest in a vest for your dome
cause i know you marks planning on getting me when im landing
peace to nick but my cannon go gun sound

verse 4 ludacris
fuck a medic we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab
bleeding so hard youll need a life size maxi pad
so flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month
ak47 for the niggas whos really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
got killers in my squad and im the nicest one in my group
but i got bananas for you niggas and i aint talking bout fruit
i’ll peel your cap back with the black mac
til your back crack cock the gat back like clak clak clak
swallow a hollow make em digest with a 50 caliber
your futures not looking so good tomorrows not on your calendar
i do away with the amateurs they breathing too long
ill leave em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
my shotguns are cold and hard but my desert is easy
and my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me squeeze me
and for these fakers talking greasy im starting the show
my uzi got a drum roll it goes gun sound
indistinct chatter and gunshots2embed"
