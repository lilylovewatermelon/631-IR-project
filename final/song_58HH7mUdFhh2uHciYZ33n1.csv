running through the heat heartbeat
you shine like silver in the sunlight you light up my cold heart
it feels right in the sun the sun
were running around and round like nothing else could matter in our lives
but wait but wait but wait

prechorus
the sun will stop shining soon and youll be dark in my life
yeah youll be gone its as simple as a change of heart
but im not gonna think about the future

chorus
a love like this wont last forever
i know that a love like this wont last forever
but i i dont really mind i dont really mind at all

verse 2
step into the night love it grows dark but you dont mind
hiding in the back streets yeah youll never notice me
all that i was thinking about was cleaning up my conscience
lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
was it my mistake

prechorus
or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
mmh just as simple as a change of heart
