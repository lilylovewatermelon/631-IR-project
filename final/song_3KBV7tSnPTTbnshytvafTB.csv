verse 1
im the one that got the presi flooded
you wear more chanel than anybody
you the type to get your man indicted
im the type to pull up in a spider
im the type to drive a honda
put a hundred round clip inside a dirty rifle
its dirty when it got a homi on it
fuck that nigga put a bounty on him
im the one that put that dirty in the cup
had you sippin noddin off nigga
you was gettin fronted runnin off nigga
i made myself to a boss nigga
put a hundred carats in a cross nigga
spent two hundred thousand on a cross nigga
cant never sleep cause itll cost niggas
they can never see my palms sweatin
youdve never seen the hunger in me
im so sick and tired of being humble nigga
this money put a lot of demons in me
went and tatted all these angels on me
fuck that nigga put a tracker on him
then we throw a pep rally on him
these commas coming in these haters coming in
the karma coming back from when i was gettin it in
baby mama tryna sue again
bought my little ones christian louboutins
