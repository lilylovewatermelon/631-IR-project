well i wonder what hes doing and if hes falling asleep
i wonder if the flight attendants prettier than me
i know hes coming back but i still didnt want him to leave

chorus

my dear grandmother watches birds every day
i can picture her at the window calling out their names
shes got no one else to talk to and i guess that keeps her sane

chorus
but its not a sad thing
its not a sad thing
its not a sad thing at all

verse 3
an overheard conversation from the table to my left
explaining his tattoos and the ones he hasnt gotten yet
some of them with meaning but most of them with regret

chorus
but its not a sad thing
its not a sad thing
its not a sad thing at all
