wheres my coffee
good morning dr carter hey sweetie
looks like its gonna be a long day
ahh another one huh what we got
your first patient yeah
is suffering from a lack of concepts uhhuh
originality ugh
his flow is weak another one
and he has no style ugh
what you got for him tssss okay

verse 1
let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on
dr carter to the rescue
excuse me if im late but like a thief it takes
time to be this great uhh so just wait
your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place
and im just grace one uno ace
and im trying make your heart beat like bass
hmmmm but youre sweet like cake
and i come to fix wherever your shell break
where is your originality you are so fake
so picture me like a gallery capture what i say
all i need is one mic all i need is one take
like hey brighter than a sun ray
got a pistol on a playground watch the gunplay
like no kidding no kids in the way
but the kids do watch gotta watch what we say
gotta work everyday gotta not be clich√©
gotta stand out like andre 3k
gotta kick it kick it like a sensei
you gotta have faith you gotta gotta
wait wait i think i i think i lost him
dial 118 please

good afternoon dr carter nurse
i dont know about this one
his confidence is down vocab and metaphors needs work
and he lacks respect for the game
uh let me see
you think you can save him

verse 2
okay respect is in the heart so thats where ima start
and a lot of heart patients dont make it
but hey kid plural i graduated
cause you can get through anything if magic made it
and that was called recycling rereciting something
cause you just like it so you say it just like it
some say its biting but i say its enlightening
besides dr kanye west is one of the brightest
and dr swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
and dr jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
arthritis in my hand from writing
but im a doctor they dont understand my writing
so i stopped writing now im like lightning
and you aint vince young so dont clash with the titan
fast and exciting my passion is frightening
now let me put some more vocab in your iv
here take this vicodin like it and love it
and confidence has no budget
so pay me no mind i dont walk it like i talk it cause i run it
i dont do it cause i done it and im in the emergency unit
god dunnit ive lost another one
interlude lil wayne  nurse
good evening dr carter its been a long day
but this one looks much better than the others
his respect is back up concepts sound good
his style is showing strong signs of improvement
all he needs now is his swagger
okay let me take my gloves off then
verse 3
swagger tighter than a yeast infection
fly go hard like geese erection
fashion patrol police detection
eyes stay tight like chinese connection
i stay tight like pussy at night
baby dont get me wrong i could do that pussy right
but im too wrong to write too fresh to fight
too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle
had to say it twice swagger so nice
and dont ask me shit unless it concern a price
and i dont rap fast i rap slow
cause i mean every letter in the words
in the sentence of my quotes
swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat
wait as i put the light down his throat
i can only see flow his blood starting to flow
his lungs starting to grow this ones starting to show
strong signs of life wheres the stitches heres the knife
smack his face his eyes open i reply what a night
welcome back hiphop i saved your life
outro nurse
he looks good his vitals are up
hes looking good hes looking good
i think we got one
dr carter i think we got one
yep yep we got one we saved him hes good
hes good we got one hes good
hes good we got him
we saved him hes a go
hes good36embed"
