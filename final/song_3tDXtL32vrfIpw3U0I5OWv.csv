the sun has opened up my eyes
and i dont wanna leave your side
for that lonesome road
but here i go
climbin back behind the wheel
of fifty feet of chrome and steel
and a load they need in chicago

prechorus 1
through the middle of the night unknown
i am on a ride that wont let me go

chorus
i am an asphalt cowboy
born to run underneath the stars
pay no mind to my lonely heart
i just ride ride
til im back in your arms again
ill be out here on the wind

verse 2
and sometimes late at night
i see your picture by the dashboard light
and it takes me
where id like to be
wrapped up in a blanket there
pulling ribbons from your hair and your kiss
girl thats what i miss

still i drive these horses through the rain and snow
this highspeed rodeo is all i know

chorus
i am an asphalt cowboy
born to run underneath the stars
pay no mind to my lonely heart
i just ride ride
til im back in your arms again
ill be out here on the wind

and ill ride
til im back in your arms again
ill be out here on the wind
and ill ride
through the middle of the night unknown
im on a ride that wont let me go1embed"
