you left me spinning like a disco
trying but i dont know if i can stand straight
you took me left when you knew i was right
and now i gotta fight just to make it through the day

prechorus
i never knew what you were capable of
baby i wouldve kept my heart
but i gave it up baby i fell in love
now i dont know where to start

chorus
its so cold with nobody to hold me
youre so wrong for leaving when you told me
you would never leave me by myself
out in the middle of nowhere
now im lost trying to make it on my own
i thought i could never do this alone
but now im walking by myself
out in the middle of nowhere

verse 2
you left me broken like a record baby
im baby im hurt and i dont wanna play anymore
missed every sign believed every lie
whoa whoa
and i was waiting for more

you took my heart off my sleeve
but now im taking it back back

i dont appreciate that that
you son of a gun
