when you look back on times we had
i hope you smile
and know that through the good and through the bad
i was on your side when nobody could hold us down
we claimed the brightest star
and we we came so far
and no they wont forget

chorus
whenever you remember times gone by
remember how we held our heads so high
when all this world was there for us
and we believed that we could touch the sky
whenever you remember ill be there
remember how we reached that dream together
whenever you remember

verse 2
when you think back on all weve done
i hope youre proud
when you look back and see how far weve come
it was our time to shine and nobody could hold us down
they thought theyd see us fall
but we we stood so tall
and no we wont forget yeah
