lost in the moment again
stuck where the road has no end
keeping the thought in our minds
one day life will be kind

prechorus
we are not alive
we are surviving every time
we are not alive
only dreams inside our minds

chorus
we are home
we are home
home
we are home
we are home
home

verse 2
endless days of complaints
forcing the light to our veins
keeping the hope in our minds
one day life will be kind
