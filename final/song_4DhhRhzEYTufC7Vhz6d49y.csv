chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose

yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos

everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard sleeping tonight

they know that santas on his way
hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and every mothers child is going to spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly

chorus
and so im offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninetytwo
although its been said many times many ways
merry christmas to you

harmonica solo

chorus
and so im offering this simple phrase
