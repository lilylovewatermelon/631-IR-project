we found each other
i helped you out of a broken place
you gave me comfort
but falling for you was my mistake

i claimed you so proud and openly
and when times were rough when times were rough
i made sure i held you close to me

call out my name when i kiss you so gently
i want you to stay want you to stay
i want you to stay even though you dont want me
girl why cant you wait why cant you wait baby
girl why cant you wait til i fall out of love
wont you call out my name call out my name
girl call out my name and ill be on my way and
ill be on my—
