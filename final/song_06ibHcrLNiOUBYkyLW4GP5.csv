i got too much time
what else is there to do now
overanalyze things i dont really care about
the last words he said
theres other things out there to see
and then he left me for someone who looks just like me

and i want a kid one that looks like you and me
sometimes i want out
to take you and run away
but if i write about nothing then what would they say
