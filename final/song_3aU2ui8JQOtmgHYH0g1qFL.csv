activitys killing the actor
and a cops standing out in the road
turning traffic away
there was nothing she could do until after
when his bodyd been buried below
way back in the day

chorus
oh my nothing else could have been done
made his life a lie so
he might never have to know anyone
made his life the lie you know

verse 2
i told him that he shouldnt upset her ooh
and that hed only be making it worse involving somebody else ooh
but i knew that hed never forget her ooh
while her memory worked in reverse to keep her safe from herself ooh

chorus
and oh my nothing else could have been done
she made her life a lie so ooh
she might never have to know anyone
made her life a lie you know
