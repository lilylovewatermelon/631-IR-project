so watch my chest heave as this last breath leaves me
i am trying to be what youre dying to see
feel like fuck man cant take this anymore this heartbreak this
its this life thats so thankless how could he just forsake us
it breaks us he makes us hate us he gave us
nothing but no trust and i am so fucked up
so let this gun bond us lets hide by this lust
and once we are just dust hell know that he loved us

chorus deuce
let it all burn i will burn first
god ive tried am i lost in your eyes
just let me burn its what i deserve
god ive lied am i lost in your eyes

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
so take me and make me weak and then save me
this hate that you gave me keeps saying the same thing
to sing when you hurt and to sing when you cry
to sing when you live and to sing when you die
and here at the end at the end of the hurt
all the pain aint the same when its your turn to burn
were the heart for the heartless the thoughts for the thoughtless
the lies for the honest were the gods of the godless

let it all burn i will burn first
god ive tried am i lost in your eyes
just let me burn its what i deserve
god ive lied am i lost in your eyes

bridge deuce  johnny 3 tears
so cry three tears for me
when its all gone sing me this song
so cry three tears for me
when its all gone when its all gone

verse 3 johnny 3 tears
i cannot stand who i am im this man
with this blood on my hands in this blood i am damned
so watch my wings burn as they burn in the fire
dont scatter the ashes no need for the choir

chorus deuce
let it all burn i will burn first
god ive tried am i lost in your eyes
just let me burn its what i deserve
god ive lied am i lost in your eyes
