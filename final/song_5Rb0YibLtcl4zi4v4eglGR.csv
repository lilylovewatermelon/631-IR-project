chorus
i fell straight on my face ill take the blame for that
heart been broke so many times and i cant take it back
ive been so scared of love got commitment issues
but somehow some way i fell in love with you
but how would you feel if i told you that i think you the one
how would you feel if i told you that i cant get enough
how would you feel if i told you that girl i need your love
how would you feel how would you feel

verse
how would you feel if i told you that girl i need your love
how would you feel if i told you that girl i need your touch
could you feel me if i told you that its hard to trust
i been hurt before i done heard these words before
i done took lies straight to the face been stabbed in my back
i done been crossed by my closest people cant blame you for that
last bitch told me that she love me couldnt stand on that
told me that she would never leave me then her bags was packed
so i guess you can take that story say im traumatized
they say i look just like my dad with my mamas eyes
they say our futures like my father with my mamas pride
cause if i ever kiss that cupid its a homicide
i was tryna lock up my heart and throw away the key
but somehow you made the key take control of me
i told myself never again would i ever fall
but when i see those pretty eyes i wanna risk it all
see rod wave liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likechorus
i fell straight on my face ill take the blame for that
heart been broke so many times and i cant take it back
ive been so scared of love got commitment issues
but somehow some way i fell in love with you
but how would you feel if i told you that i think you the one
how would you feel if i told you that i cant get enough
how would you feel if i told you that girl i need your love
how would you feel how would you feel
