this shit wasnt even urgent for me and i couldve shown up with nothin written
what else would i think verbll agree meant verbal agreement
and i only took this for the cash of courseagain
i write for matches i dont have any passion for
this for vacation
they even booked me in the one room hotelthis was my last resort
you gotta play your part
this gangsta shit was never for the faint of heart
renounce that you try to clip me off i bounce back
i cant let it slide besides im bout that
and karma always come back like a house cat
mac extended clip you know that i mean business
30 in the 10 ive over the speed limit
hes trippin until i grip the thing
and he into mr thing smith the ring im tryin to blow you to smithereens
im in the lou kicks lightin up the block billie jean
your angels duck while i handle macs well maxwell hit pretty wings
silly thing i let the barrel stick to ya chest dont fight the 12
or anybody resisting arrest he speaks so arrogant
i dont need no wise words from a therapist
nigga keep the battle shit you woke but not makin no moves thats sleep paralysis
i creep sporadically with chrome to greet you longest eagle
pistol whip you til your skulls showin
flip this to the backside and youll have your bonus features
im known for heaters you only do a stage
this nigga said he could do the elvis move holdin on a gauge
poor elvis presley rollin in his grave
that aint even detrimental im loadin up an eight
lower with the graze
bow even lettin you live did you a favor just to bring it up and throw it in your face
ill buck the gat i dont believe nothin when this sucka rap
you sell a fight
i said i dont believe nothin when this sucka rap
a nigga swung on me when my foot was broke whats up wit that
you can sell a fight but when its showtime you break a leg
good luck with
jersey
you might also likeround 1 aye verb
not only am i gon beat you but im gon teach you
so standin in front of verb you gain somethin
you just dont lose and lose
im a god with this twork
i eat from the garden twork
your rap ability draws power from the foods that you consume
and you consume chicken turkey sucka
i dont understand how these lame nigga think
so for me tryin to process how squares move around
its like its like tryin to crack the code on a rubiks cube
lets not lose this mood
fans prepare for lyrical evolution
as i dissect through this illusion
of hes the new hot nigga out now and here he kills
well hes in the presence of a king nigga here he kneels
vegan verb but i still brought that eerie feel
if i left yall cups empty from catchin bodies well here refill
this aint a battle this is dinner time
from another rookie flimsy spine primitive rhyme slave for smack
who will take the whip back like its enterprise
hell recline i stand up i got that og posture
smooth nigga skin glow like im from okinawa
your flow low key blahblah my emoji mobsters
im solo wit it i never need a staff i aint low key loki patna
fade catcher afterwards we can pop out back like an og mogwai

you dont belong here you long winded but short gifted
thats how you take your move and throw some sauce in it

round 3 nu jerzey twork
ima be totally honest theres no comparison wit us
a showtime and a strapped in is how this match was solely decided
you win if i only allow it
i watched you get booed your whole motherfuckin careerand im supposed to be modest
beggin smack to get them crowds to quiet down
baow now he call tell em to give you a moment of silence

how your career came and then went
and now its rbe kotd
and they payin you top dollar what you claim in defense
but you battlin for a king of the dot necklace
over here its a whole nother chain of events
its not for cameras this glock bananas
you seen the proof cause nina shoot when i command her
like point and view and only see it from my point of view its propaganda
i promote the violence
i remember when you dropped the waves and got the box fade i was so astonished
wanted to grab the box blade ya chin and poke inside it
your brains on top ya fade he thinkin outside the box he openminded
followed by the bird with the long nose its pocahontas
i hold the nine up that bitch barkin no prints on it
no more ride up hes off his high horse hes prince cha
none of them sermons can work my mom a pastor
she had a small congregation
i watched her have to live off the money that she earned from the church
while i was robbin givin her my cash two different paths
she even had to stand firm where it hurts
you can look at my past and see its all darker
paul walkermy life took a turn for the worse
first you gotta show me what that action bout
cause ill kill you then cremate you and ill come to your mother crib and pour your ashes out
empty out the dust like a vacuum pop
