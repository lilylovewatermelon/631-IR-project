close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
there is no time to waste asking why
ill run away with you by my side
ill run away with you by my side
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
i need to let go let go let go let go of this pride
asking why

verse 1
i think about your face and how i fall into your eyes
the outline that i trace around the one that i call mine
a time that called for space unclear where you drew the line
i dont need to solve this case and i dont need to look behind

chorus
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
there is no time to waste asking why asking why
ill run away with you by my side by my side
ill run away with you by my side ill run away with you
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
i need to let go let go let go let go of this pride
asking why

verse 2
do i expect to change the past i hold inside
with all the words i say repeating over in my mind
some things you cant erase no matter how hard you try
an exit to escape is all there is left to find

close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
there is no time to waste asking why asking why
ill run away with you by my side by my side
ill run away with you by my side ill run away with you
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
i need to let go let go let go let go of this pride
until this echo echo echo echo in my mind
until this echo echo echo echo can subside

outro
so i
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
there is no time to waste asking why
ill run away with you by my side
ill run away with you by my side ill run away with you
close my eyes let the whole thing pass me by
i need to let go let go let go let go of this pride
until this echo echo echo echo in my mind
until this echo echo echo echo can subside2embed"
