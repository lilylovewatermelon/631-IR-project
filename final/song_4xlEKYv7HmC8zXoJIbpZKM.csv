live a simple life in a quiet town

youve had too much to think now you need a wife

youve found yourself a friend that knows you well
but no matter what you do
youll always feel as though you tripped and fell

settle for a world neither up or down
settle for a world neither up or down

sell it to the crowd that has gathered round
sell it to the crowd that has gathered round
