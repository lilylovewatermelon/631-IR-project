goodbye  weekend
so long darling
mackys been a bad bad boy
and when theyre preaching
be sure to change me
should rearrange me
or so they thought

chorus
so dont go telling me how this boy should be leading
his own life
sometimes rough but generally speaking im fine
if you dont agree with the things that go on within my life
well honey thats fine just know that youre wasting your time

verse 2
sort me place me
give me a sign
repeat the mantra
when youre stepping out of line
give me a number
something to be
may help out the country boy
but it wont work out on me
you might also likesolo

chorus
so dont go telling me how this boy should be leading
his own life
sometimes rough but generally speaking im fine
if you dont agree with the things that go on within my life
well honey thats fine just know that youre wasting your time

outro
