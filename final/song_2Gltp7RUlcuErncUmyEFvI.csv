speedin’ in a black jeep headed to the freeway
if anybody slows down it’s a problem
kilos in the backseat million in the briefcase
yo if anybody finds out ima rob ‘em

chorus
maybe i can say ive made some mistakes in the past
but this is today not a care in the world
just me and my girl it’s okay
i welcome the rain

bridge
oh i gave you all the storm that you could weather
one day can turn into forever
and who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run the run

interlude
just put your foot on the gas now go go go
aye promise this’ll be the last time

verse 2
beatin’ down the backstreets feelin’ like a street race
won’t let a nigga find out there’s some cops on the way
done a lot of bad deeds but tryna live easy
partner right beside me try to stop us
you might also likechorus
maybe i can say ive made some mistakes in the past
but this is today not a care in the world
just me and my girl it’s okay
i welcome the rain

bridge
you stood beside me through the stormy weather
you know one little storm could last forever
and who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run the run

outro
if we ever get away i’ll be sure
sure not to make the same mistakes as before
i know you would die for me won’t you babe
you already ride for me don’t you babe4embed"
