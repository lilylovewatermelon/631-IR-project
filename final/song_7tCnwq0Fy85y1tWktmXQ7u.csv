ive gone for too long
living like im not alive
so im gonna start over tonight
beginning with you and i
when this memory fades
im gonna make sure its replaced
with chances taken hope embraced
and have i told you

im not going
cause ive been waiting for a miracle
and im not leaving
i wont let you
let you give up on a miracle
when it might save you

verse 2
weve learned to run from
anything uncomfortable
weve tied our pain below
and no one ever has to know
that inside were broken
i try to patch things up again
to count my tears and kill these fears
but have i told you have i
