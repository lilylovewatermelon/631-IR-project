she had an earthquake on her mind
i almost heard her cry out as i left her far behind
i knew the world was crashing down round her
i sink now to the ocean floor
because i know that we are more

prechorus
but ive made this mess
ive built this fire
are you still mine

chorus
cause baby im not all right when you go
im not fine please be all mine
i never want you to go because i am all yours
so please be all mine

verse 2
she had an earthquake on her mind
apparently the kind that would bury us alive
by putting all this weight on us forever
i lie here on the ocean floor please be all mine
broken castle by the shore

prechorus
and ive made this mess
ive built this fire
are you still mine
