when a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
and shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
and its all because she dont want things to change

chorus
so cry if you need to but i cant stay to watch you
thats the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to but i cant stay to hold you
thats the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to but i cant stay to hear you
thats the wrong thing to do
cause youll say you love me and ill end up lying
and say i love you too

refrain
but i need someone different
you know it oh you know it
oh you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh you know it
oh you know it we both know it
somethings been missing
you know it oh she knows it
oh i know it we all know it
i need someone different
oh oh

chorus
so cry if you need to but i cant stay to watch you
thats the wrong thing to do

cause youll say you love me and ill end up lying
and say i love you too

oh you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh you know it
oh you know it we both know it

you know it oh she knows it
oh i know it we all know it
i need someone different
