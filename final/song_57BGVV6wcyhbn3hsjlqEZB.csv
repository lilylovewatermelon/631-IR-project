i might just hit it raw hold on thats not my element
i like dark skins love her melanin
huh christian louboutin what im steppin in
thirty bottles of azul tell em send em in
i had the lambo switch to the rari
im a gangster but i like to party
pop a perky go retarded
im a brooklyn nigga im coldhearted

verse
thats why i like the bad gyal woah like riri wait
every time she see me she wanna eat me hold on
i saw like justin bieber please believe me
i said wow im on the tv
i cant fuck with broke bitches they be creepy
she be actin up she always tryna leave me
but she a bad gyal and she freaky
i have her hangin off the rod like she mimi
i never hit a bitch more than once cause they be leeches
but her pussy good it taste like peaches
but she can have it i dont need it
id rather have my money green like kiwi
i dont talk to niggas cause they be cappin
disrespect me and see what happen
i dont make a call for war i start snappin
grr them bullets blastin
all the opps mad that i lapped them
he said whats stackin nothin but my money
member my pockets flat now they chunky
i aint a pretty boy but i aint ugly
and ill take your bitch in a second
if she a real one then ill protect it
traded the ap told my jeweler patek it
and its all vvs and flower settings
you might also likechorus
i might just hit it raw hold on thats not my element
i like dark skins love her melanin
huh christian louboutin what im steppin in
thirty bottles of azul tell em send em in
i had the lambo switch to the rari
im a gangster but i like to party
pop a perky go retarded
im a brooklyn nigga im coldhearted
