its like you got superpowers
turn my minutes into hours
you got more than 2020 babe
made of glass the way you see through me
you know me better than i do
cant seem to keep nothing from you
how you touch my soul from the outside
permeate my ego and my pride

chorus
i wanna love me ooh
the way that you love me ooh
ooh for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
id love to see me from your point of view
i wanna trust me trust me
the way that you trust me trust me
ooh cause nobody ever loved me like you do
id love to see me from your point of view

verse 2
im gеtting used to receiving
still gеtting good at not leaving
ima love you even though im scared oh scared
learnin to be grateful for myself oh oh oh
you love my lips cause they say the
things weve always been afraid of
i can feel it startin to subside
learnin to believe in what is mine

i wanna love me ooh
the way that you love me ooh
ooh for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
id love to see me from your point of view
i wanna trust me trust me
the way that you trust me trust me
ooh cause nobody ever loved me like you do
id love to see me from your point of view

bridge
i couldnt believe it or see it for myself
know i be impatient
but now im out here fallin fallin
frozen slowly thawing got me right
i wont keep you waitin waitin
all my baggage fadin safely my baggage fadin
and if my eyes deceive me
wont let them stray too far away

chorus
i wanna love me ooh
the way that you love me ooh
ooh for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
id love to see me from your point of view
i wanna trust me ooh trust me
the way that you trust me baby trust me
cause nobody ever loved me like you do
id love to see me from your point of view oh
