verse 1 tech n9ne  krizz kaliko
erybody just throw your hands up what
all the ladies just throw your legs up what
all the fellas just throw your cups up
and toast to the homeboy thats off in yo girls guts what
say man she say she broke up with you last week
now you trippin cause your chicken went out and passed cheeks
and got a fast leak from tecca n9na katrina
now shes right up in mi cocino while your ass sleeps
howd i take her from you oh it twernt nothin
its because your girly girly know i earn somethin
now i got them legs over my shoulders
holdin my soldier swollen i cant hold my composure
and when i come to town your woman come around
and plenty fun is found when i give her some of the clown
the kansas city style got her yellin just gimme now
you dont wanna hear the sound cause im doin bout 20 rounds

chorus tech n9ne  krizz kaliko
if your girls at a tech show its what you thinkin

she know you barely make it we got crazy cash
on the movie set me and my homie baby bash
got your girl waitin to get her world shakin
at the grand american givin your girl spankings
cause shes a bad gal she said she need a release
so she greeted with beast now shes no longer sad now
im with your wifey
cause she say i make her feel wanted and by the way she never met nobody like me
at the grafton laughin makin her stare at these
kutty cal grese chris seven and periclease
got your hottie naughty when she drinkin on caribeez
at kid rocks and im off in a booth with tara reid
tecca n9na is not a coward ill jump in the shower
and bumpity bumb that rock girl if you doubt us

chorus tech n9ne  krizz kaliko

verse 3 tech n9ne
i see you mad at me but my nads happy
cause you losin and now you wanna take a stab at me
she hangin with me cause you foul nigga
and im at the four seasons takin her to eat a tao nigga
thats tao when i see a ho
shes hooked when i let the instant replay go
shes bare now everyones there throwin wood at it
man this musics so unfair if you good at it
come with us women its so fun with us under the sun with us
from dawn til dusk ima give her the lovin that make her wanna say hamdulillah
praisin this craziness in vegas when i get up on the stage its outrageous
mandelay bay with the right ages everybody get laid to this

shell lie to you and wont blink
when it come to tech n9na bein with your lady
