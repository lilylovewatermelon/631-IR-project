chorus
how far you wanna go in the back

she want me i want more of the drink

verse
so my mind give me more to think
and i cant take no more of that
all bossed up she ignorin me
but i want my lil tori back
trippin on x no more of that
all my emotions got absorbed with that
my son asked why my water pink
it hurt cause i aint mean to show him that
i gotta get my order back
what the fuck ima do with forty racks
besides spend a lot on hoes in saks
i hope its more to rap
but i care what my brothers think
they started on my corner like floyd dad
how you want more of me
im rich but i still get sorta sad
these lil niggas big quarterbacks
big in the pocket but avoid the sack
dont you get bored of that
uh hmm ayy
how you gon lower me
i get high and adore the racks
first to the money i record the racks
i cant see me goin back
