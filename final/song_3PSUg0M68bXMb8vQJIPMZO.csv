cook that shit up quay
dont know how to feel i got some feelings that i cant explain
yeah

verse 1
clothes busted nose dusty watch the older bros hustlin
started off wrong but you couldnt tell me i aint know nothin
all i ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin
knockin on my sister window comin in at 4 somethin
mama trippin bout the way im livin and how my hoes comin in and out
caught the nextdoor neighbor slippin we slimed him left his nose runnin in his house
knowin i cant lie so when she asked me i  make no comment
terrorizin thuggin doin dumb shit makin no money
it was time for me to go up got a pack and made it blow up
went into that corner store until i got it all
know i skipped a couple parts but i cant never tell em all
but the moral of the story i got it all out the mud
the way karma make me feel i swear i think im in love
been fuckin strippers since i was lil fell in love with the club
bruh gave me everything i need knew what to say to the plug
i got my hands on a few mil but shit it still aint enough
its like my life is like a dream but im still here when i wake
im gon get everything i need ill do whatever it take
i caught a case ran got away i shouldve jumped in the lake
i thought about it the other day when i slid through in the wraith

damn my lifes changed check my ice game
came from standin in the rain to top floor gettin brain
still actin the same i walk in they know my name
dont know how to feel i got some feelings that i cant explain
damn my lifes changed check my ice game
came from standin in the rain to top floor gettin brain
still actin the same i walk in they know my name
dont know how to feel i got some feelings that i cant explain

verse 2
bad bitch we both young
they say that im cheatin and we both dumb
but baby got her wrist hittin both arms
gwagen and range rover both of em
if we love forever you get new homes
i just wish that other  could move on
she proud to be rockin that new twotone
my life goin good why would i do wrong
im livin my best just like lil duval
i didnt get the message and its screw yall
i dont want no issues cant be beefin with my family
i dont want no problems just make sure my kids can count and read
and it aint no pressure bout the money i wont even see it
its bigger its the principle i hope one day that you can see
we got a whole seed to raise its bigger than you and me
how im not gon do that i spend millions on my jewelry
the only reason im mentionin it is cause im tired of this foolery
im just emptying my thoughts i cant keep em in a box
aint no hard feelings at all i want everyone to ball
chorus
damn my lifes changed check my ice game
came from standin in the rain to top floor gettin brain
still actin the same i walk in they know my name
dont know how to feel i got some feelings that i cant explain
damn my lifes changed check my ice game
came from standin in the rain to top floor gettin brain
still actin the same i walk in they know my name
dont know how to feel i got some feelings that i cant explain
