call you up on a tuesday
say whats up babe its too late
whyd you have to be so complicated
complicated

chorus
cause im not sure if ive seen you before
you looked familiar when i saw you
we go together like the gum on my shoes
we make out we make out when its too late
we go out we go out on a tuesday

verse 2
a crowded place waiting for you
am i lost why cant i find you
a silhouette thats in my head
you dont exist youre my imagination
you dont exist youre just a bad decision

chorus
cause im not sure if ive seen you bеfore
you looked familiar when i saw you
wе go together like the gum on my shoes
we make out we make out when its too late
we go out we go out on a tuesday
you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
cause im not sure if ive seen you before
you looked familiar when i saw you
we go together like the gum on my shoes
we make out we make out when its too late
we go out we go out on a tuesday16embed"
