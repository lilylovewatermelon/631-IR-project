screaming on the inside
i am frail and withered
cover up the wounds
that i cant hide
walls that lie between us
the saint within the sinner
i have lost the nerve
but its all right

prechorus
carry the wounded and shut your eyes
all will be forgiven
none will rise
bury the fallen and lead the blind
i will fight the loss
dead inside

chorus
into the nothing
faded and weary
i wont leave and let you fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive
see breaking benjamin liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likeverse 2
leave me at the bottom
i am lost forever
letters from the dead
say goodbye
sorrow falls upon us
this will be the last time
days begin to end
but ill get by

prechorus
follow the hopeless and shut your eyes
all will be abandoned
none will shine
gather the broken and leave this life
lying in the earth
side by side

chorus
into the nothing
faded and weary
i wont leave and let him fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive
bridge
ill keep you inside
where i lead you cannot follow
straight into the light
as my breath grows still and shallow

chorus
into the nothing
faded and weary
i wont leave and let them fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive

outro
stay with me
youre all i have left
i know we can make it out alive

stay with me
youre all i have left
i know we can make it out alive5embed"
