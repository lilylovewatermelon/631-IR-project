standing on top of the edge it feels like its going down
everything stays in my mind feeling in a daze on the ground
feels like its going to give lifes too hard to live anymore
i think ive had enough things too tough
im out the door

chorus 1
all in all its just another day now
youre falling down
what you gonna do
standing on top of the world tonight
no ones looking back at you

chorus 2
stand tall
its going on
its going on
its gonna be just fine
youre holding on
holding on today

verse 2
things dont stop and the others announced theyre moving on
salt  tears in the minds in the mouths of a bad decision
too late for another mistake its bringing me down
with all your faults it isnt your fault
whats going on

so you lost yourself
so you lost your way
found life through someone else
but you threw it all away

times rolling on
