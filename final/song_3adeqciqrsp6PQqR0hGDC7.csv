havent seen you since high school
good to see youre still beautiful
gravity hasnt started to pull
quite yet i bet youre rich as hell
one thats five and one thats three
been two years since he left me
good to know that you got free
that town i know was keeping you down on your knees

chorus patrick monahan  ashley monroe
these bruises make for better conversation
loses the vibe that separates
its good to let you in again
youre not alone in how youve been
everybody loses we all got bruises
we all got bruises

verse 2  patrick monahan  ashley monroe both
have you seen him not in years
how about her no but i hear
shes in queens with the man of her dreams
funny back then she said that about you
que sera youll never guess who i saw

lets do this soon again ten years is that what its been
cant believe how time flies by
leaving you makes me wanna cry
