one fifty a shot three for you and three for me
im checking your body language i love the conversation
and when you lick your lips i get a tingling sensation
now were both bout tipsy you say you in the mood
all i need is bout a hour better yet maybe two
let me take you where i live ferrari switch gears
when i whisper in your ear your legs hit the chandelier
passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
ima let tpain sing it so he can make it clear
