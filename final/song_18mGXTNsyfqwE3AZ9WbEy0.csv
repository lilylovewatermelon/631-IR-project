i saw you from the bottom of the stairs
fore you knew i was coming
and though nervous and scared
i lingered on
i heard most things break
by the ends of these types of nights
so ill force upon
every word i brushed up on
since knowing we wont speak like this again
verse 2 brendan lukens  adrienne gold
youve got a certain whoknowswhat about you
and ive got a small amount of time
to figure out what it is exactly and to whom does it apply
but i know for a fact that these are broken nights
covered in bottles with the stench of loss of life
and i know that its quite
heartbreaking we wont speak like this againyou might also like3embed"
