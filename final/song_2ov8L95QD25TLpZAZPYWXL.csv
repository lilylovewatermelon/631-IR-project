verse 1
mr crowley what went on in your head
oh mr crowley did you talk to the dead
your lifestyle to me seemed so tragic
with the thrill of it all
you fooled all the people with magic
yeah you waited on satans call

verse 2
mr charming did you think you were pure
mr alarming in nocturnal rapport
uncovering things that were sacred
manifest on this earth
conceived in the eye of a secret
and they scattered the afterbirth

verse 3
mr crowley wont you ride my white horse
mr crowley its symbolic of course
approaching a time that is classic
i hear that maidens call
approaching a time that is drastic
standing with their backs to the wall
