not the reunion i was planning on
now i just came to give my regards and keep my faith
let go of your words that ive been hanging on

oh ive been setting fire to my bed sheets
oh dont you twist your tongue just to protect me
just scream “mayday were going down

now i must say youve had my mind in quite the wreck
and i deceived you with false virtue
now i am sitting like a gambler in his debt
counting all the ways that i would hurt you

oh ive been setting fire to my bed sheets
oh dont you twist your tongue just to protect me
just scream “mayday were going downsee wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeembed"
