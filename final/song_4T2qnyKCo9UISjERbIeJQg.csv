ive been sleeping with the lights on
cause the darkness is surrounding you
this is my world this is my choice
and youre the drug that gets me through

prechorus
ive been waiting for an answer
because i built this bed for two
im just hanging on your answer
i built this bed for me and you

chorus
cant you see that i am yours
so will you be my life support
youre my life support
youre my life support

verse 2
sick of waking up in darkness
when the sky is always painted blue
theres a method to my madness
it’s clear that you don’t have a clue

prechorus
ive been waiting for an answer
because i built this bed for two
im just hanging on your answer
i built this bed for me and you
