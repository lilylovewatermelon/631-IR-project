caught up in this madness too blind to see
woke animal feelings in me
took over my sense and i lost control
ill taste your blood tonight
prechorus
you know i make you want to scream
you know i make you want to run from me baby
but know its too late youve wasted all your time

yeah

verse 2
relax while youre closing your eyes to me
so warm as im setting you free
with your arms by your side theres no struggling
pleasures all mine this time
prechorus
you know i make you want to scream
you know i make you want to run from me baby
but know its too late youve wasted all your time

chorus
cherishing those feelings pleasuring
cover me unwanted clemency
scream til theres silence
scream while theres life left vanishing
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing

weve all had a time where weve lost control
weve all had our time to grow
im hoping im wrong but i know im right
ill hunt again one night

prechorus
you know i make you want to scream
you know i make you want to run from me baby
but know its too late youve wasted all your time

chorus
cherishing those feelings pleasuring
cover me unwanted clemency
scream til theres silence
scream while theres life left vanishing
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
perishing

guitar solo
bridge
some live repressing their instinctive feelings
protest the way were built dont point the blame on me
verse 4
scream scream scream the way you would
if i ravaged your body
scream scream scream the way you would
if i ravaged your mind
chorus
cherishing those feelings pleasuring
cover me unwanted clemency
scream til theres silence
scream while theres life left vanishing
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
