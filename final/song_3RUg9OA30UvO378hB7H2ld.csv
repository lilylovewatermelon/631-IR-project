so what if i was just a painter
painting houses on the rich blue coast
would you ever try to leave me
for somebody who deserves you most
cause darling i am just a painter
im painting houses for the rich old folks
im gonna make a million dollars
cause nobodys gonna steal you no
for diamonds and gold
for diamonds and gold

chorus
cause ive broken bones for you
and for you only
i make money but we just cant keep this home
give me your heart and your hand
and we can run
we can run we can run baby run now
we can run baby run

verse 2
shes like a bullet through an ocean
i still remember how you moved so slow
you tried to kill me with a shotgun
bang now were even
we dont stop till someones bleeding
we dont stop till someones bleeding
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
ive broken bones for you
and for you only
i make money but we just cant keep this home
give me your heart and your hand
then we can run
we can run we can run baby run now
we can run baby run baby youre my hope

verse 3
permanently yours
sometimes the moon looks brighter than the sun
as times like this run up my wrists
she hates all of the guts and blood
splash around with me
while we move like flames on burning sheets
and your doctor wont stop calling me her medication
but baby no sometimes things dont work out the way weve planned
to live is just to fall asleep
to die is to awaken

bridge
maybe were meant to lose the ones we love
but ill fight for you till then
and if he stole you from me
on my arm theres a tattoo of your name
outro
ive broken bones for you
and for you only
i make money but fuck money
we want love
give me your heart and your hand
and we can run
we can run we can run we can run
we can run we can run we can run18embed"
