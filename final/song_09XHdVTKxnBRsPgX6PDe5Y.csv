how small do you want me to be
weighed in the balance left lonely
so much can be said through silence
as hard as it seems all that we need
is too close to be seen

chorus
our lives
you build your walls for me to climb
a billion walls for me to climb
you build your walls for me to climb

verse 2
travels the very nature well live in
seasons to cycles children to men
mislead and misread
company or companion
with all of our hearts we follow our dreams
slightly out of reach

chorus
our lives
you build your walls for me to climb
a billion walls for me to climb
you build your walls for me to climb

chorus
our lives
you build your walls for me to climb
a billion walls for me to climb
you build your walls for me to climb1embed"
