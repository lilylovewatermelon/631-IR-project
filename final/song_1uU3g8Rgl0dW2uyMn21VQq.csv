verse mf doom
not a lot of bling
when he do the thing bada boom bada bing
from the womb to the tomb
get that ricotta bada bing bada boom
doom your reputation precedes you
wait til you crack and see what weed do you dweeb you
no pun intended takes one to know one well no  its unscented
yo son demented when them sent it from the other time
before everybody and they mother rhyme
what a crime  beats is the same way
make em wanna hit the streets with the heat for a lames pay
game day flag on the play improper helmet
drag on the suede from the gem drop of well spit
he didnt listen titty kissin the city glistened
depending on what from what position youre sittin
in the pissy wind is this thing whistlin
who let the spinnin whisperin djinn in
the villain again
without a doubt thats his name
dont play it out or spray it when you say it out your mouth
then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
and told him take a gold shower for fakin funk soul power
stocky short and cocky
looked like apollo kreig after he fought with rocky
rhymed in a broken engalish slang not cockney
thirteen his first queen wore hot knock knees
had to tell her pops yo stop cockblockin b
hold somethin for your daily yay habit
then go badabingbingbing like ricochet rabbit
how bout the sicko say stab it
theres liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crab pit
and heineken i told him much obliged friend
what i gotta spend if i only touch her thighs then
why his eyes widened
he didnt know your man had a nice surprise hidin
took pride in ridin in a sly wiseguy grin
real recognize real
on the microphone or wheels of mechanized steel
please at least respect your ideals
how you got her walkin along the stroll in high heels
he said her mamma was gettin old
god bless her poor soul now no more drama is your role
straight to the head
he know a lot of haters cant wait til he dead
lead to gold like a ho to a strange whack housewife
only thing he know it changes back though how trife
rules is rules dont go there
stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
keep a snotty chicken on e the lone ranger
why everybody always pickin on danger
and doom maybe its him
called up my lady told her baby its slim
make me up a margarita i need to take a swim
tell them kids remember school  if they let em out cool
but get the hell from out the pool
you might also likeoutro master shake
hey â€‹shithead its me again
and you know what i just heard its all done now
and somehow i guess you must have lost my number
you know what you suck
you suck your music sucks
and i hate your sucky stupid metal face
i hope you burn youre going down
this is the last big mistake youll ever make
you suck i hate your guts
but if there is another project in the future please keep me in mind
thank you
pt 2 meatwad  beef rap
outro meatwad  carl
beef rap could lead to getting teeth capped
or even a wreath for ma dukes onon some grief crap
i suggest you change your diet
it can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
or even a stroke heart attack heart disease
it aint no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
take the easy way out phony until then
they know they wouldnt be talking that baloney in the bullpen
so disgusting pardon self as i discuss this
they talk a wealth of shit and they aint never seen the justice
that was off the beat
bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet
two batteries some brillo and some foil hea boil it
he be better off on pc glued
and its a feud so dont be in no tv mood
each week its mystery meat seaweed stewed
food we need food
cause i cant stop that pimpin any more
i forgot bout why i started pimpin for
there you go yeah thats good4embed"
