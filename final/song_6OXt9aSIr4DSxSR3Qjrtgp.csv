i work in the dead of night
when the roads are quiet and no one is around
to track my moves racing the yellow lights
to find the gate is open shes waiting in the room
i just slip on through

prechorus
you get in you get done and then you get gone
you never leave a trace or show your face you get gone
shouldve turned around and left before the sun came up again
but the sun came up again

verse 2
enter the morning light
to find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
in a little white room
no im not alone her head is heavy on me
shes sleeping like a child
what could i do

prechorus
you get in you get done and then you get gone
you never leave a trace or show your face you get gone
shouldve turned around and left before the sun came up again
but the sun came up again

i was a killer was the best theyd ever seen

suddenly im in over my head and i can hardly breathe
suddenly im floating over her bed and i feel everything
suddenly i know exactly what i did but i can not move a thing
and suddenly i know exactly what id done
and what its going to mean to me mean to me
im gone

chorus
