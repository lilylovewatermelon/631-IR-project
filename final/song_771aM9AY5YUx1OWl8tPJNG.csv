verse  snoop dogg
roll up a fat one and pass it around
lay back hypnotized by the neptunes sound
my peoples always see me and they think im on point
so they roll me a blunt or either pass me a joint
im the modern day rick james yeah thats me
anything less than the best is blasphemy
so ask for me  when you wanna get spliffted
im not keith murray but ill get ya lifted
terrific cause this is just the linguistics
this shits cannibalistic so i mixed it and twisted
with the berries and cherries the high berries
the aura is horror man this shit is so scary
i took another hit and then my vision got blurry
i had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
im looking at this chick real thick her name is cheri
big fat booty and her pootie was hairy cmon biatch

verse  snoop dogg
nick nack patty wack give a dogg a bone
naw dont gimme nothing but a handful of stones
dont stop i aint finised yet
you say you got the bomb you wanna make a bet its on
i blew about three zones then took baby home
nigga what motherfucker im grown
i have it how i want it did it done it and stunted
fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
aint nothing to it but to do it so i did it cause im wit it
this is the face off the one hitter quitter
itll lay you on your back fast sweat start to trickle
everything is moving like you on a tricycle
you caught up in the pickle but i get you out
i blow you a charge through your nose not your mouth
slow down ho damn youre doing too much
youre supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up cmon

verse  snoop dogg
yeah this is classic fantastic im blasted
ive been growing and blowing niggas wonder how i lasted
well like jesus i fasted for 40 days and 40 nights
i got it all mastered
now i need a hit of that neptuneology
gangsta philosophy yep yep i gotta be
real high whenever writing my novelty
because it adds to my celebrity
so i celebrated teledated innovated dominated
orchestrated situated petuated reinstated
then i created youre happy that i made it
take another hit young nigga get faded
were going all out smoke till ya fall out
do double g house all in ya mouth
the west got the best the east got the peace
im out and about with a blunt in my mouth peace
