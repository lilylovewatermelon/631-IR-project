singing silly songs

im lying awake
your voice makes me shake
singing songs i can stand more
the shower runs dry
but i dont know why
youre still singing like mad

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe
silly milly if youre still trying
to send my hair flying
youre losing a friend

how can i explain
im trying in vain
to get used to her simple songs
but she does not care
and i cannot bear
that shes driving me mad

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe
silly milly if youre still trying
to send my hair flying
youre losing a friend
you might also likebaby tell me have you
gone out of your head
come on silly milly come on
milly cant you see that
youre making me feel bad
come on silly silly silly
silly silly silly

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe
silly milly if youre still trying
to send my hair flying
youre losing a friend

silly milly if youre still trying
to send my hair flying
youre losing a friend

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe
silly milly if youre still trying
to send my hair flying
youre losing a friend
silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybe

silly milly you nearly kill me
now why dont you thrill me
my love is still strong but maybeembed"
