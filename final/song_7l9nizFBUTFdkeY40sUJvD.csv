they held on to the will of god so we are told
they wouldnt bow
they would not bow their knees to idols made of gold
they wouldnt burn
they were protected by the fourth man in the fire
they wouldnt bend
they wouldnt bow they wouldnt burn

now the prophet daniel tells about
three men who walked with god
shadrach meshach and abednego
before the wicked king they stood
and the king commanded them bound and thrown
into the fiery furnace that day
but the fire was so hot that the men were slain
that forced them on their way

now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
to witness this awful fate
he began to tremble at what he saw
in astonished tones he spake
did we not cast three men bound
into the midst of the fire
well lo i see four men unhurt
unbound and walkin down there
you might also liketheres shadrach meshach and abednego
and the fiery coals they trod
but the form of the fourth man that i see
is like the son of godembed"
