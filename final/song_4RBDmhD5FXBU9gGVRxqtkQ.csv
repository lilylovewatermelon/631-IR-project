flesh wound flesh wound
with medication it will fade
should i assume
that someone hears me when i pray

prechorus 1
love full of hate
dont you love
how i break

chorus
dont let them throw me away
aahha
keep me and ill be okay
aahha
skipping a beat but it plays
aahha
dont let them throw me away
aahha
dont let them throw me away

verse 2
screwed up used up
crumble lying on the floor
fucked up shut up
all you did back then was score
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeprechorus 2
im feeling weak
missing parts
incomplete

chorus
dont let them throw me away
aahha
keep me and ill be okay
aahha
skipping a beat but it plays
aahha
dont let them throw me away
aahha
dont let them throw me away

bridge
hold me up into the light
fix the cracks and fix them right
keep the pieces in the drawer
keep them there forever more
wake a million thoughts someday
recycle this shit in someway
and all that i have to say
dont let them throw me away
chorus
dont let them throw me away
aahha
keep me and ill be okay
aahha
skipping a beat but it plays
aahha
dont let them throw me away
aahha
dont let them throw me away5embed"
