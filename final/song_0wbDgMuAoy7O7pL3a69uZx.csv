is it goin is it goin
is it goin is it going
i dont know what youre lookin for
oh yeah boy come on

verse 1 nelly furtado
im the type of girl that look you dead in the eye eye
im real as it comes if you dont know why im fly
i seen you to try switch it up but girl you aint that dope
im the wonder woman let me go get my rope
im a supermodel and mommy — sí mami
amnesty international got bangkok to montauk on lock
love my ass and my abs in the video for promiscuous
my style is ridicdicdiculousulousulous

chorus nelly furtado
if you see us in the club well be actin real nice
if you see us on the floor youll be watchin all night
we aint here to hurt nobody so give it to me give it to me give it to me
wanna see you work your body so give it to me give it to me give it to me

verse 2 timbaland
when timbo is in the party everybody put up they hands
i get a half a mil for my beats you get a couple grand
never gon see the day that i aint got the upper hand
im respected from california way down to japan
im a real producer and you just a piano man
your songs dont top the charts — i heard em im not a fan
niggas talkin greasy im the one that gave them they chance
somebody need to tell em that they cant do it like i can
you might also likechorus nelly furtado
if you see us in the club well be actin real nice
if you see us on the floor youll be watchin all night
we aint here to hurt nobody so give it to me give it to me give it to me
wanna see you work your body so give it to me give it to me give it to me

verse 3 justin timberlake
could you speak up and stop mumumbling i dont think you came in clear
when youre sittin on the top its hard to hear you from way up here
now i saw you tryna act cute on tv just let me clear the air
we missed you on the charts last week — damn thats right you wasnt there
now if ssexy never left then why is everybody on my shit
dont hate on me just because you didnt come up with it
so if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way
cause our run will never be over — not at least until we say uh

chorus nelly furtado
if you see us in the club well be actin real nice
if you see us on the floor youll be watchin all night
we aint here to hurt nobody so give it to me give it to me give it to me
wanna see you work your body so give it to me give it to me give it to me
