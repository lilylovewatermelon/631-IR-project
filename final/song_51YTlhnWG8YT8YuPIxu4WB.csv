youve got her in your pocket
and theres no way out now
put it in the safe and lock it
cause its home sweet home

verse 1
nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
to trick a woman make her feel she did it her way
and youll be there if she ever feels blue
and youll be there when she finds someone new
what to do
well you know

chorus
you keep her in your pocket
where theres no way out now
put it in the safe and lock it
cause its home sweet home

verse 2
the smile on your face made her think she had the right one
and she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun
but now she might leave like shes threatened before
grab hold of her fast before her feet leave the floor
and shes out the door
cause you want

to keep her in your pocket
where theres no way out now
put it in the safe and lock it
cause its home sweet home

verse 3
and in your own mind you know youre lucky just to know her
and in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
but now youre scared you think shes running away
you search in your hand for something clever to say
dont go away
cause i want

chorus
to keep you in my pocket
where theres no way out now
put it in the safe and lock it
cause its home sweet home
