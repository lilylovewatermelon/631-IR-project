today i saw my hero fall apart
the one who taught me to be strong
on the outside i look fine
but on the inside i am dying
my strength is overcome by pain
my love for you remains the same
the loneliness is setting in
i have no one to free my sins

chorus
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its yours and mine

verse 2
now its my turn to help you out
because you were there when i was down
its hard for me to see you this way
losing all your sanity
you helped me to keep my dreams alive
without you how will i survive
its time for me to be a man
now i finally understand
you might also likechorus
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its yours and mine
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its yours and mine

bridge
i cant run anymore
i cant hide anymore
i cant run anymore
i cant hide anymore

reprise
today i saw my hero fall apart
the one who taught me to be strong
on the outside i look fine
but on the inside i am dying

chorus
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life
the time is now its yours and mine
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its yours and mine
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its do or die
its never too late to live your life live your life
the time is now its yours and mine
outro
