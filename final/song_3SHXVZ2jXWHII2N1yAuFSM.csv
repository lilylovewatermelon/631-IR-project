whats left to say that hasnt been already said before
did i ever have a purpose i cant feel it anymore
if ignorance is happiness please steal me from my head
cause the voices once so soothing make me feel so fucking so fucking dead

we are the numb complacent we are the broken youth

prechorus
whats left to say that hasnt been
whats left to say that hasnt been
whats left to say that hasnt been
whats left to say that hasnt been

we come undone we are the ugly truth
we are the numb we are the broken youth
we come undone we are the ugly truth

bridge

i cant stop i cant stop
