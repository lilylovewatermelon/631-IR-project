its crazy
i cant believe that you
would be the one to do
do me like you do
get back here baby

verse 1
when you let me have my way
i was thinkin i could get it again
baby we could be friends if youre lonely
and then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
you were off in the wind tell me where did you go

prechorus 1
when you left im thinkin which way did she go
i shoulda known that you led me on girl
im in the wind on cruise control
i gotta be dreamin cause i never felt like this before

chorus
it was supposed to be just the one night
in and out and im out the door
but shes got me sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
so why am i sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
see usher liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likeverse 2
now its rainin and im lookin over at the passenger side
thinkin back in my mind how you set me off
she was stoppin and droppin me switchin from fast to slow
but that had nothin on how you got when i got you home

prechorus 1
when you left im thinkin which way did she go
the way you touched yourself had me up the wall
im in the wind on cruise control
im searchin for you cause i cant seem to let you go

chorus
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
but shes got me sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
so why am i sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her

interlude
you know
i really only thought
that this would be a onenight stand
what you doin to me
come on
what you doin to me
bridge
maybe shes runnin home to someone else
or maybe she lost my number in her cell
or maybe shes run it down like this before
cause i cant see her not comin back for more more

chorus
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
but shes got me sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
so why am i sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
but shes got me sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for her
it was supposed to be just the onenight
in and out and im out the door
so why am i sittin here at the red light
drivin round lookin out for herembed"
