all the lights go down
as i crawl into the spaces
fight flight or the screams
life tearing at the seams

chorus
wait
i dont ever want to be here
like punching in a dream
breathing life into my nightmare

verse 2
if it falls apart
i will surely wake it
bright lights turn me green
this is worse than it seems

chorus
wait
i dont ever want to be here
like punching in a dream
breathing life into my nightmare

in the place that you fear it the most
in the corner where it’s warmer
in the face that you wish was a ghost

wait
i dont ever want to be here
like punching in a dream
