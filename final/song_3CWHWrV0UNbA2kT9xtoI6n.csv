i bought this camera
to take pictures of my love
now that hes gone
i dont have anybody to take pictures of
a lonesome highway
is a pretty good subject
im gonna make myself make use of this thing

ive spent my life
so lost on lovin
i could have been a painter or a president
but after 25 years
i should be good at something
gone are the days of me being so reticent
