sixteen lines
of blow and im fine
youre wastin your time
please dont cry

chorus
sixteen lines of blow and im fine
break my bones but act as my spine
i wonder who youll fuck when i die
and if i tried to call would you cry
please dont cry youre wastin your time
sixteen lines to make me feel fine
ten years ago i went blind
i been on my own since age nine
sixteen lines of blow and im fine
break my bones but act as my spine
i wonder who youll fuck when i die
and if i tried to call would you cry
please dont cry youre wastin your time
sixteen lines to make me feel fine
ten years ago i went blind
i been on my own since age nine

verse

chorus
sixteen lines of blow and im fine
