katy dont cry i know
youre trying your hardest and the hardest part is letting
go of the nights we shared
ocala is calling and you know its haunting
but compared to your eyes
nothing shines quite as bright
and when we look to the sky
its not mine but i want it so

chorus derek sanders and jake bundrick
lets not pretend like youre alone tonight
i know hes there and
youre probably hanging out and making eyes
while across the room he stares
ill bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
and ask my girl to dance
shell say yes
because these words were never easier
for me to say or her to second guess but i guess
that i can live without you but
without you ill be miserable at best

verse 2 derek sanders
youre all that i hoped id find in every single way
and everything i would give is everything you couldnt take
cause nothing feels like home youre a thousand miles away
and the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
cause i know im good for something i just havent found it yet
but i need it so

lets not pretend like youre alone tonight
i know hes there and
youre probably hanging out and making eyes
while across the room he stares
ill bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
and ask my girl to dance and shell say yes
because these words were never easier
for me to say or her to second guess but i guess
that i can live without you but
without you ill be miserable at best

verse 3 jake bundrick
and this will be the first time in a week
that ill talk to you and i cant speak
its been three whole days since ive had sleep
cause i dream of his lips on your cheek
and i got the point that i should leave you alone
but we both know that im not that strong and
i miss the lips that made me fly so

chorus derek sanders and jake bundrick
lets not pretend like youre alone tonight
i know hes there and
youre probably hanging out and making eyes
while across the room he stares
ill bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
and ask my girl to dance
shell say yes
because these words were never easier
for me to say or her to second guess but i guess
that i can live without you but without you ill be miserable
and i can live without you but without you ill be miserable
and i can live without you but oh without you ill be miserable at best16embed"
