funny how its hard to find the words sometimes you know
wishin we could read minds
dont wanna let our feelings show
so even if you say you dont understand
im willing to give as much time as i can
cause every time our eyes meet

be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me talkin to me
talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
just aint no need for words to speak oh
cause every time be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
be talkin talkin talkin to me talkin to me

verse 2
youre always actin so composed and cool
never got too many words for me too many words
you always turn your head and make sure i see just to make sure
baby aint nothin wrong with the love
that you and i dream of so sweet
your actions say more than your lips can speak
my friends say that they just cant see they just cant see
how a love unspoken can be so deep can be so deep
and every time that you look my way
i see what your heart wants to say to me
