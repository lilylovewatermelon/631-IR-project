it starts with one

verse 1 mike shinoda mike shinoda  chester bennington
one thing i dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away its so unreal
didnt look out below
watch the time go right out the window
tryin to hold on ddidnt even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go

prechorus mike shinoda
i kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard

chorus chester bennington
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesnt even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesnt even matter

one thing one thing i dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin me
actin like i was part of your property
remembering all the times you fought with me
im surprised it got so far
things arent the way they were before
you wouldnt even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end

prechorus mike shinoda
you kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard

chorus chester bennington
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesnt even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesnt even matter
