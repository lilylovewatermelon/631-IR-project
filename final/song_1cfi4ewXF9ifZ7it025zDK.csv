im just a traveling man you see
wherever this road goes is where i will be
and i’ll catch me a ride on a boat to spain
tell a woman that i love her then forget her name
and i wish i could stay for midday coffee
but i just cant get this dreamin off me
if i could find me a place to rest my mind
but mama always said you’ll get there in good time

chorus
theres some headlights burning down the highway
and i think that i may just hitch me a ride
cause im a traveling man by trade sir
were all runnin from the things inside

verse 2
therеs a train headin west to south toledo
and if thе dogs don’t sell me asleep i’ll go
dreamin as i’m steamin past miles of ground
through the souls and hymnals that built these towns
wont stay too long and leave too soon
the best time for goin is when the goin’ scares you

chorus
theres some headlights burning down the highway
and i think that i may just hitch me a ride
cause im a traveling man by trade sir
were all runnin from the things inside
