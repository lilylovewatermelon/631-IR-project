im somebody you call when youre alone
im somebody you use but never own
im somebody you touch but never hold
and youre somebody ill never really know
i know im not the one you really love
i guess thats why ive never given up
cause i could give you all you want
the stars and the sun but still im not enough

prechorus
oh all i really wanted was that look in your eyes
like you already know that im the love of your life
like you already know youre nеver saying goodbye

chorus
but im not yours
im not yours im not yours
i want more
i want morе but im not yours
and i cant change your mind
but youre still mine

verse 2
so tell me that its time for me to go
cause you know i cant do it on my own
the only thing thats harder than sleepin alone
is sleepin with your ghost

oh all i really wanted was that look in your eyes
like you already know that im the love of your life
like you already know youre never saying goodbye

chorus
but im not yours
im not yours im not yours
i want more
i want more but im not yours
and i cant change your mind

bridge
i shouldve known that it was dumb love
fifteen dozen roses
all the things that ive done
for you not to notice
cant believe i chose you
over all my best friends
what the fuck did i do
in the end
just to not be yours24embed"
