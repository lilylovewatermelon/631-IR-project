youre everything i thought you never were
and nothing like i thought you couldve been
but still you live inside of me
so tell me how is that
youre the only one i wish i could forget
the only one id love to not forgive
and though you break my heart
youre the only one

prechorus
and though there are times when i hate you cause i cant erase
the times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
and even now while i hate you it pains me to say
i know ill be there at the end of the day

chorus
i dont wanna be without you babe
i dont want a broken heart
dont wanna take a breath without you babe
i dont wanna play that part
i know that i love you but let me just say
i dont wanna love you in no kind of way no no
i dont want a broken heart
and i dont wanna play the brokenhearted girl no no
no brokenhearted girl
im no brokenhearted girl

something that i feel i need to say
but up to now ive always been afraid
that you would never come around
and still i wanna put this out
you say youve got the most respect for me
but sometimes i feel youre not deserving me
and still youre in my heart
but youre the only one

prechorus
and yes there are times when i hate you but i dont complain
cause ive been afraid that you would walk away
oh but now i dont hate you im happy to say
that i will be there at the end of the day

chorus

i dont want a broken heart
and i dont wanna play the brokenhearted girl no no
no brokenhearted girl
