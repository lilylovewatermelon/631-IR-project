but the grounds too wet for the hopper now
got a cultivator and a double tree
a leather line for the haw and gee
let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
im doing alright for country trash

im saving up dimes for a rainy day
i got about a dollar laid away
the winds from the south and the fishings good
got a potbelly stove a cord of wood
mama turns the leftovers into hash
im doing alright for country trash

i got a mackinaw wand a hunting dog
a cap i ordered from the catalog
a big tall tree that shades the yard
a big fat sow for the winters lard
let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
im doing alright for country trash

well theres not much new ground left to plow
and crops need fertilizing now
my hands dont earn me too much gold
for security when i grow old
but well all be equal under the grass
and gods got a heaven for country trash
and gods got a heaven for country trash
ill be doing alright for country trashyou might also likeembed"
