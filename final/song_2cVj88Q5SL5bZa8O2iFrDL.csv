as logic stands you couldnt meet a man whos from the future
but logic broke as he appeared he spoke about the future

prechorus
were not going to make it he explained how the end will come
you and me were never meant to be part of the future

chorus
all we have is now
all weve ever had is now
all we have is now
all well ever have is now

verse 2
i noticed that he had a watch and hat that looked familiar
he was me from a dimension torn free of the future

prechorus
were not going to make it he explained how the end will come
you and me were never meant to be part of the future

chorus
all we have is now
all weve ever had is now
all we have is now
all well ever have is nowsee the flaming lips liveget tickets as low as 87you might also like3embed"
