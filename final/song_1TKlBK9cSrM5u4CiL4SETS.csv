the deal was we would get to go if we
cleaned it up and got it running
daddy’s old winnebago
wing and a prayer down 65
five best friends on four bald tires
i can still see billy smiling
when we finally made it
to talladega
boys raised up
whiskey in your glass
here’s to turning up
slowing down
and cars that go real fast
we were laughing and living drinking and wishing
and thinking as that checkered flag was waving
sure would like to stay in
talladega
like a storm time rolls on
you can’t hit pause thats just the deal
most days in life don’t stand out
but life’s about those days that we all like
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likerocking randall
getting rowdy
shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the alabama sun was breaking
over talladega
boys raised up
whiskey in your glass
here’s to turning up
slowing down
and cars that go real fast
we were laughing and living drinking and wishing
and thinking as that checked flag was waving
sure would like to stay in
talladega
when the winds go cold
and it blows october
i think about us shoulder to shoulder
like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
in my mind
tonight i’m in talladega
boys raised up
whiskey in your glass
here’s to turning up
slowing down
and cars that go real fast
we were laughing and living drinking and wishing
and thinking as that checked flag was waving
sure would like to stay in
talladega
