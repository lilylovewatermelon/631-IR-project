told you i felt lucky with my humble breasts
well i dont
said that i was sure the world was gonna change
well im not
before i didnt give a damn bout what they say
but i do
promised that id never ever lie to you

prechorus 1
but look at how
im takin the makeup off my face
before i forget my own features

chorus
cause im not here to let you down
but the costume makes the clown
thats just lifes anatomy
dont be so hard dont be so hard on this
its your turn now to cheat on me

verse 2
the promises i made to you went down the sink
really hope i havent harmed your self esteem
im not a virgin but im not the whore you think
and i dont always smell like strawberries and cream

its your turn now your turn now
