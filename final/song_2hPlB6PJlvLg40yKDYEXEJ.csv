ill lay down my glasses
ill lay down in houses
if things come alive
ill subtract pain by ounces
yeah i will start painting houses
if things come alive
i promise to commit no acts of violence
be it physical or otherwise
if things come alive

bridge
ill say it now
ill say it now
ill say it now
oh ill say it now
cause i want it now

chorus
when personality is scarred tissue
we travel south with disuse
im subtle like a lions cage
such a cautious display
remember take hold of your time here
give some meanings to the means
to your end
not even jail
see interpol liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
we marshal in the days of longing
we tremble like anyones children
and wink towards the fire
im erring on the side of caution
betraying no other symptom
but girl you shake it right
i will bounce you on the lap of silence
we will free up to the beats of science
and girl you shake it right
ill say it now

bridge
oh but hold it still darling your hair so pretty
cant you feel the warmth of my sincerity
you make motion when you cry
youre making peoples lives feel less private
dont take time away
you make motion when you cry
we all hold hands cant we all hold hands
when we make new plans

chorus
i pretend like no one else
to try and control myself
im subtle like a lions cage
such a cautious display
remember take hold of your time here
give some meanings to the means
to your end
not even jail11embed"
