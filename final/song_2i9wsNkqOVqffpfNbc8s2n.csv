how did anybody find out where i was
how did anybody find that out
i was hiding from the world i was a squirrel
but you chopped down my tree to get my fur

prechorus
fear of sleep fear of sleep the fear of sleep
fear of sleep fear of sleep fear of sleep
oh fear of sleep cant you wait im not done
fear of sleep here you come
fall asleep fall asleep fall asleep

chorus
youre no fun youre no fun
youre no fun youre no fun youre no fun
youre no fun youre no fun
youre no fun youre no fun youre no fun

verse 2
i guess everybodys week must have been pretty rough
cause everybody is drunk loud and pissed off
i know you hate to be impressed with someone else other than yourself
but you know trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

prechorus
fear of sleep fear of sleep fear of sleep
fear of sleep whered you go fear of sleep
oh fear of sleep so you know im not done
here we go here you come
fall asleep fall asleep fall asleep
