your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love

verse 1
maybe i need some rehab
or maybe just need some sleep
i got a sick obsession
im seein it in my dreams
im lookin down every alley
im makin those desperate calls
im stayin up all night hopin
hittin my head against the wall

prechorus
what youve got boy is hard to find
i think about it all the time
im all strung out my heart is fried
i just cant get you off my mind

chorus
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love

wont listen to any advice
mommas tellin me i should think twice
but left to my own devices
im addicted its a crisis
my friends think ive gone crazy
my judgments gettin kinda hazy
my steeze is gonna be affected
if i keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

prechorus
what youve got boy is hard to find
i think about it all the time
im all strung out my heart is fried
i just cant get you off my mind

chorus
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love

bridge
i dont care what people say
the rush is worth the price i pay
i get so high when youre with me
but crash and crave you when you leave
verse 3
hey so i got a question
do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement
do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum
is my love your drug
your drug
huh your drug
huh your drug
is my love your drug
what youve got boy

chorus
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love

outro

your love your love your love your love
your love your love your loveembed"
