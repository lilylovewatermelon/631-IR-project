i look over my shoulder
to see what im leaving behind
pieces of puzzles
and wishes on eyelashes fail

oh how do i show
all the love inside my heart
well this is all new
and im feeling my way through the dark

and i used to talk
with honest conviction
of how i predicted my world
im gonna leave it to stargazers
tell me what your telescope says

oh what is in store for me now
its coming apart
i know that its true
cause im feeling my way through the dark

try to find a light on somewhere
try to find a light on somewhere
im finding im falling in love with the dark oh yeah

i dont care where i start
for my troubles are few
as im feeling my way through the dark
through the dark
im feeling my way through the darkembed"
