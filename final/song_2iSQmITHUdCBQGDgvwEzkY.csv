my life in a nutshell
this is my life in a nutshell

chorus
this is my life in a nutshell
heavens so far away im startin to love hell
they know me for my talent my talent
but dont know how my pain feels pain feels
these prescriptions that i fiill
never make the pain heal

verse 1
fuck uh
back in the lost and found i go
but im more lost than found i know
i feel so cold in la like im sittin back at home chicago
they say livings harder than dyin im willing to gamble that
find me unresponsive in a hotel room girl can you handle that
worst case scenario
you still hear my songs on the stereo
you still hear my name on the radio
so ill live forever forever

chorus
this is my life in a nutshell
heavens so far away im startin to love hell
they know me for my talent my talent
but dont know how my pain feels pain feels
these prescriptions that i fiill
never make the pain heal

hoohoh
death melodies i sing
cardiac arrest notes
i hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
but thats the ugly truth
so much of my life and time the worlds consumed
i throw the deuce and grab the noose
onto the next chapter
none of this matters
ive been feelin helpless

chorus
this is my life in a nutshell
heavens so far away im startin to love hell
they know me for my talent my talent
but dont know how my pain feels pain feels
these prescriptions that i fiill
never make the pain heal37embed"
