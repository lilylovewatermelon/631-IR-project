i could put the ball in the end zone
put a bad bitch in the friendzone ooh
this shit sound like an intro
jetson give me that tempo ooh

told her dont let her friends know dont
in the ville and i move like a don don
eating fettuccine at vincenzos

on the west coast yeah im talking bout prerolls preroll
dark haired bitch and she look like shego she do
hometown hero feeling myself cant murder my ego cant do it
she heard of my deep stroke
she said babe does it hurt when i deep throat it does
certified freak ho
hang around us and she learnin my lingo
back then wasnt worried bout me though
in the gym tryna work on my free throw

but she dont put this on the gram nah
lil boys tryna diss on the gram ayy
i cant switch on the fam bitch
shits hot hit the switch on the fan hit that shit
this where my head is listen
i feel resentment from every direction
even some homies be wearing expressions
i be discouraged from sharing my blessings damn
we used to share a connection
now it just feels like its wearing and stretching
im getting real sick of taking advice
from people that never could stare at reflections ooh
somewhere in there is a lesson
yall aint evolvin its very depressing
im at the club with the basketball team
me and the cardinals are sharing a section facts
gotta cherish the present
im drinking water and wearing protection
got a career and im very invested
some people call it a scary obsession ooh period but
i like to call it a passion
i cant be sitting relaxin nah i cant
pg we getting some traction
im at the venue its packed in packed out
im digging her accent
i got a bb simon belt on me
and she tryna get it unfastened
thats my type of distraction
thats my type and she latin thats facts ooh
got my own flow and im bout to get a patent
brand new sheets for the bed they satin soft real soft
