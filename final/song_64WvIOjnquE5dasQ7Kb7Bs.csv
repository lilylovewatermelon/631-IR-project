tonight we lie awake
remember how the coffee made us shake
on those long drives
one more long night
another seven days
heartbeat racing the interstate
my home tonight
for one more long night
im sure as hell the happiest ive ever been

chorus
we get high we let go
weve got more than we know
my friends are a different breed
my friends are

verse 2
theres a ghost in this room
i think ill name it after all of you
and watch it hang over my bed
like decorations celebrated
memories they came and went
in light of all the time we spent
listening to everything
our parents told us not to take in
now make a change
im counting down
the mile marks to every town
and falling more in love
with the distance put between us
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
we get high we let go
weve got more than we know
my friends are a different breed
my friends are everything
make this last take it slow
weve got it all figured out for now
so let us live our lives without a doubt

verse 1
tonight we lie awake
remember how the coffee made us shake
on those long drives
one more long night
another seven days
heartbeat racing the interstate
my home tonight
for one more long night

bridge
from coast to coast ill make the most
of every second ive been giving with this crowd
without a doubt youre all i dream about
at night we lie awake with stories taking us back to
the nights we felt alive
the nights we felt alive

i wouldve married you in vegas
had you given me the chance to say i do
couldnt make it any more obvious could you
be any more obvious
i wouldve married you in vegas
had you given me the chance to say i do
couldnt make it any more obvious could you
be any more obvious could you2embed"
