i am guilty
ashamed of what ive done what ive become
these hands are dirty
i dare not lift them up to the holy one

chorus
you plead my cause
you right my wrongs
you break my chains
you overcome
you gave your life
to give me mine
you say that i am free
how can it be
how can it be

verse 2
ive been hiding
afraid ive let you down inside i doubt
that you still love me
but in your eyes theres only grace now

chorus
you plead my cause
you right my wrongs
you break my chains
you overcome
you gave your life
to give me mine
you say that i am free
how can it be
how can it be

from this death i will rise with you
oh the grace reaching out for me
how can it be
how can it be

chorus
you plead my cause
you right my wrongs
you break my chains
you overcome
you gave your life
to give me mine
you say that i am free
how can it be
you plead my cause
you right my wrongs
you break my chains
you overcome
you gave your life
to give me mine
you say that i am free
