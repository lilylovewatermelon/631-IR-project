i been trippin on you babe
i cant find the right words to say
cuz i cant believe what you done to me
been giving up my body
you thought i would never find out
you got my mind in a daze
but you can do your thang baby
im getting outta your way

chorus
this time im
gonna tell her goodbye
no more her in my life
no more lies
think its time that i fly
leave my troubles behind

verse 2
i started to call on you
when i came in from outta town
cause your girl put me down
that that you was sleeping around
i asked you where you been
you said i was with my friends
but youyou were on woodland
yes and freaking your 110
you might also likebreak
feel so phony
here im pulling girl
oh girl

chorus
this time im
gonna tell her goodbye
no more her in my life
no more lies
think its time that i fly
leave my troubles behind

verse 3
six the morning
had to start jumping
rubbin your body tight
all through the night
thats when you said
those words to me
you said i love you babe
and dont leave
five in the morning
you started scheming
i saw you creep
didnt know that i was peeping
told me that you was sleeping
im not believing
what im seeing
chorus
this time im
gonna tell her goodbye
no more her in my life
no more lies
think its time that i fly
leave my troubles behind
this time im
gonna tell her goodbye
no more her in my life
no more lies
think its time that i fly
leave my troubles behindembed"
