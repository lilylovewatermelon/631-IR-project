some look for trouble while others dont
theres a thousand reasons i should go about my day
and ignore your whispers which i wish would go away oh

youre not a voice youre just a ringing in my ear
and if i heard you which i dont im spoken for i fear
everyone ive ever loved is here within these walls
im sorry secret siren but im blocking out your calls
