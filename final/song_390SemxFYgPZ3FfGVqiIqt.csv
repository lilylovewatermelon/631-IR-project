ive been waitin a long time
for this moment to come im
destined for anything at all
downtown lights will be shinin
on me like a new diamond ring out
under the midnight hour
well no one can touch me now well
and i cant turn my back its too late
ready or not at all

chorus
well im so much closer than
i have ever known
wake up

verse 2
dawning of a new era calling
dont let it catch ya falling
ready or not at all
oh so close enough to taste it
almost i can embrace this feelin
on the tip of my tongue

chorus
well im so much closer than
i have ever known
wake up
