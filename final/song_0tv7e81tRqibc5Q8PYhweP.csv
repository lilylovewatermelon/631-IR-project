im scared today more than i told you i was yesterday
give me a moment to catch my breath
and hold me every second left
proud of me thats the only way i want you to be
look at me and love what you see

bridge
i wont make it alone
i need something to hold

hook
kiss me on my shoulder
tell me its not over
i promised to always come home to you
remind me that im older
to be brave smart sweet and bolder
and dont give up on what were trying to do
dont count the miles count the i love yous

verse 2
we made it out
and all the other people are asking how
this doesnt even sound like truth
to grow from a bruise
but one day we will realize
how hard it was how hard we tried
and how our hearts made it out alive
you might also likehook
kiss me on my shoulder
tell me its not over
i promised to always come home to you
remind me that im older
to be brave smart sweet and bolder
and dont give up on what were trying to do
dont count the miles count the i love yous

verse 3
and these are words i wish you said
but thats not how it went
cause you gave up on us in the end

bridge
i wont make it alone
i need something to hold

hook
kiss me on my shoulder
tell me its not over
i promised to always come home to you
remind me that im older
to be brave smart sweet and bolder
and dont give up on what were trying to do
dont count the miles count the i love yous
kiss me on my shoulder
tell me its not over
i promised to always come home to you
remind me that im older
to be brave smart sweet and bolder
and dont give up on what were trying to do
dont count the miles count the i love yous3embed"
