verse 1 2pac
i want money in large amounts
my garage full of cars that bounce
movin my tapes in major ways ‘cause every dollar counts
busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
they runnin off at the mouth til i fill it up with my pump
they jump my automatic keep em wary
why you frontin like you billy badass nigga you scary
ive been knowin you for years
we was high school peers in junior high
i was itchin to kill and you was ready to die
while you bullshittin niggas was dyin and catchin cases
bustin my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
leavin no trace they see my face and they buried
them bitches die in a hurry still i ride im never worried
mr makaveli tell me to ride and ima ride
pick my enemies out the crowd and motherfuckers die
its not the way i wanna live my nigga its how it is
