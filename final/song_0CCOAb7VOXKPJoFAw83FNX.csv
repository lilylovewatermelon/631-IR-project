yeh suh
we creep

we throw we blow
uh huh yeh suh
we fly
yeh suh
no lie
yeh suh
off the trank and the dank so high
yeh suh
its my arrival and my survival
im skyin higher then messiah an his bible
watch for that rifle
watch for that psycho
yo breezy chosen n she lookin kinda tight though

now if you talk that talk
ya better walk that walk
dont let this pretty face fool ya
cuz im a savage
like a dallas maverick
got nephews thatll do ya
snatch that jeerzy off your skeleton with the quickness
and if its wall ta wall betta gaurd your jaw we handlin biness
servin this game like tennis we up in this mean muggin
crackin the fuck up at them squares dream thuggin
blowin our trees cousin
it gets sticky in the pain
tricky in the tank
and dont miss me wit that dank
500 on the street equals 65 gs
in that jordan briefcase like that boy from the piz
bigger then show biz
so im stayin focused
when they holla at the club
how much them blows is
