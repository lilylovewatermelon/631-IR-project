yeah
shit felt this shit in my soul nigga like
got me feelin this shit
time for niggas to start payin me

chorus
no license top down you still pushin
fuck a nigga we slide the block they still pussy
12 watchin but you got kids you gotta get it
and i gotta put some food up in that kitchen
these niggas cant feel my pain in it ayy
and all this shit it took a nigga just to get here
nigga try me i let it bang on him
we came from nothin never thought that we would get here
and my circle is full of made niggas
you dont bring bread to the table then you cant sit here
i know these niggas dont feel my pain nigga nah nah
but i promise im bout to have it rockin this year uhhuh

verse
talkin packs in diesel sellin that liquid by the liter
i aint go to school today my nigga i got holes in my adidas
i got stains on most my tshirts and these niggas they used to laugh
but they cant laugh now that that flow come out them speakers
nigga nah
and they thought they caught me slippin but i turned around and banged on em
turned around and flamed on em
shit just sound insane dont it
icy on my wrist you know my jeweler go insane on it
shooters thatll kill you for a chain with the gang on it
you cant feel they pain on it you cant feel they pain on it
snatch a nigga soul and his chain in the same moment
my baby cryin tears and who the fuck am i finna blame on it
so i hit that corner if i die ill be a stain on it
know im from that block i swing an ox i do my thang on it
life is not a game so i aint got no time to play opponents
life is not a game so i just hit the block and spray opponents
in the pockets layin on em
in the drop im waitin on em
sellin soda mama worried i pay dues baby
hug the corner mama worried i make the news baby
back then did it all for a pair of shoes baby
lookin back at it i couldnt understand my views baby
on the comeup and i want ice and flashy rings nigga
everything we never had as kids drove us insane nigga
you had it we had it but it wasnt the same nigga
now imagine niggas havin fame nigga
we was on the train nigga bust down the chain nigga
bust down the jewels like we bust down the thing nigga
got rid of some niggas they mood i couldnt hang with em
smile in my face but them niggas was hidin hate in em
oh no
you might also likeinterlude
yeah we was born champions
and we was turned soldiers
somewhere encaged in the concrete jungle we all lost touch
head to the sky back to the wall
young and not fully prepared to understand the facts of it all
with starvation in our stomachs and concentration in our eyes
you see niggas deprived of a life we thought was perfect
so what that mean is every scheme hustle and jugg is worth it until we murdered nigga

chorus
no license top down you still pushin
fuck a nigga we slide the block they still pussy
12 watchin but you got kids you gotta get it
and i gotta put some food up in that kitchen
these niggas cant feel my pain in it ayy
and all this shit it took a nigga just to get here
nigga try me i let it bang on him
we came from nothin never thought that we would get here
and my circle is full of made niggas
you dont bring bread to the table then you cant sit here
i know these niggas dont feel my pain nigga nah nah
but i promise im bout to have it rockin this year uhhuh2embed"
