well i aint had nothin to drink
i knew thats probably what youd think
if id drop by this time of night
remember way back when
i promised you id drop in
at one of those meetings down at the y

verse 2
they started talking about steps you take
mistakes you make the hearts you break
and the price you pay
i almost walked away

verse 3
you could hear a pin drop
when this old man
stood up and said im gonna say it again
like i do every week
for those who dont know me

chorus
its the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
that you miss the most when you lose control
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
have another shot just one more beer
yeah ive been there
thats why im here

then he cried as he talked about wasted years
i couldnt believe what i heard
it was my life word for word
and all of the sudden it was clear

chorus
its the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
that you miss the most when you lose control

have another shot just one more beer

thats why im here

chorus
its the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
that you miss the most when you lose control
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
have another shot just one more beer
yeah ive been there
