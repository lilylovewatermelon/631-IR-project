after midnight we could feel it all
id go anywhere you want me to
you should see theres a place i want to take you
when the train comes i will hold you
when the train comes i will hold you
cause you blow my mind
on the bridge levitating cause we want to
when the unknown will surround you
when the unknown will surround you
there is no right time
there is no right time
the branches of the trees
they will hang lower now
you will grow too quick
then you will get over it
the branches of the trees
they will hang lower now
theres a place i want to take you
when the unknown will surround you
theres a place i want to take you were you high
when they knocked on the door looking for you
when the unknown will surround you take my hand
as our bodies lift up slowly
theres a place i want to take you were you high
when they knocked on the door looking for you
when the unknown will surround you take my hand
as our bodies lift up slowly
