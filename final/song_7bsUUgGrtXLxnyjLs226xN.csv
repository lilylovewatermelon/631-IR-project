what if the devil was a lie
what if god did not exist
so with all due respect tell me what is death
if life is just a bitch
i see the evil in their eyes
i hear the lies behind their grin
they wander in the dark they do not have a heart
dont let them take you in
brace for impact

prechorus
you will pay the price for betraying me
you will pay the price
you will pay the price for betraying me
you will pay the price

chorus
so save yourself
because the tide is rising high
its sink or swim its hit or miss
what will you pick
so take some action
dont let the undertow grab hold
its sink or swim its hit or miss
man overboard man overboard
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 2
do you believe in ghosts
conducting from the grave
were nothing but pawns so move to where they want
cause life is just a game
i have my hands around your throat
and a smile upon my face
squeeze until you choke cause i will not let go
until i feel okay

prechorus
you will pay the price for betraying me
you will pay the price for betrayâ€”

chorus
so save yourself
because the tide is rising high
its sink or swim its hit or miss
what will you pick
so take some action
dont let the undertow grab hold
its sink or swim its hit or miss
man overboard man overboard
