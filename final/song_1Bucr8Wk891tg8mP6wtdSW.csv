midnight in montgomery silver eagle lonely road
i was on my way to mobile for a big new years eve show
i stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town
put my collar up i found his name and felt the wind die down

verse 2
and a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
wearing shiny boots a nudie suit and haunting haunted eyes
he said friend its good to see you its nice to know you care
then the wind picked up and he was gone was he ever really there

chorus
cause its midnight in montgomery
just hear that whippoorwill
see the stars light up the purple sky
feel that lonesome chill
cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
smell whiskey in the air
midnight in montgomery
hes always singing there

verse 3
well i climbed back on that eagle took one last look around
through red tail lights a shadow moved slow across the ground
and off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
i can hear that whistle moan im so lonesome i could cry

cause its midnight in montgomery
just hear that whippoorwill
see the stars light up the purple sky
feel that lonesome chill
cause when the wind is right youll hear his songs
smell whiskey in the air
midnight in montgomery
hes always singing there

outro
yeah hes always singing there
oh hanks always singing thereembed"
