aint give a fuck about nothin in the slums takin risks
remember we was starvin we was lurkin for a lick
now im on my way to stardom hoes stoppin me for pics
park the benz in calabasas yeah a young nigga rich
already got em mad and im bout to make em sick
flex so much cause i aint never had shit
and the road we was takin we aint really think this lifestyle exist
man i swear that i aint never picture this

verse 1
killing our community to eat heroin serving
we got out that jam and then the hot car started swerving
went from the backseat of the tahoe now we pull up in suburbans
cant fix my broken heart i need way more than a surgeon
life had knocked me down and then that savage started merging
had to tell myself nigga go take it you deserve it
only know what i let em this shit deeper than the surface
too wrecked to open up just put my pain up in these verses
masked up late night with the gang going purging
used to risk it all tryna act like i wasnt nervous
had dreams to ball on that big stage like kyrie irving
ran through two hundred thousand i wasnt thinkin i was splurgin

chorus
aint give a fuck about nothin in the slums takin risks
remember we was starvin we was lurkin for a lick
now im on my way to stardom hoes stoppin me for pics
park the benz in calabasas yeah a young nigga rich
already got em mad and im bout to make em sick
flex so much cause i aint never had shit
and the road we was takin we aint really think this lifestyle exist
man i swear that i aint never picture this

where im from niggas get a gun and feel invincible
where im from we go straight to guns and getting physical
young kids dying aint surprising that shit typical
act like he a demon til this 40 make him spirtual
whole life changed man this shit feel like a miracle
these bitches love rappers she gon fuck me cause im lyrical
im the chosen one i aint your average individual
kind hearted kid them trenches turned me to a criminal
had to hold for mines when them times was gettin critical
eyes on the money see the snakes in my peripheral
anything can happen man this shit is unpredictable
wont fall out with my brothers cause the love is unconditional

chorus
aint give a fuck about nothin in the slums takin risks
remember we was starvin we was lurkin for a lick
now im on my way to stardom hoes stoppin me for pics
park the benz in calabasas yeah a young nigga rich
already got em mad and im bout to make em sick
flex so much cause i aint never had shit
and the road we was takin we aint really think this lifestyle exist
man i swear that i aint never picture this11embed"
