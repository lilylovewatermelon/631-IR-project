verse travis scott  pharrell williams
we just rocked coachella i gave her half of the check
it was good sex honorable mention to the neck
just let this wash on me
didnt pass the loud that was out of respect
afterwards pass the towel i was out of kleenex in the memory standing in the ocean
if you take your girl out do you expect sex
if she take her titties out do you expect checks
first visit i gave her a pearl necklace just let this wash on me
next visit ima need your girl naked feels like slow motion
took a church visit you know cause the world hectic

its like floating if i cant be in time

in the ocean if i cant be loved
i dont know a sound
