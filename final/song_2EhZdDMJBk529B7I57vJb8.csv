sweet thing living it
wont you let me let you live it a little bit
i know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
but heres how to deal with it
on your weekly visits
use a code name to protect the innocent ha
maybe im too generous
generally believing that all women want me
they dont wanna get even girl i know
but who do you believe in
is it money or god
betrayal trust this thing of ours  girl
should be secretly held sacred cause i love it when you pop your bodybody
and move your bodybody
drink up on the bacardi and rub up alongside me
i love to see you wild and free
but occasionally you get cold wet feet
and all that it means to me is you need my heat ja
cause when its said and done youre gonna want me
loving thugging you baby
