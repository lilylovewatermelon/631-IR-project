burn the witch
burn the witch
burn the witch
burn the witch

verse 1 josh homme
holding hands
skippin like a stone
on our way
to see what we have done
the first to speak
is the first to lie
the children cross
their hearts and hope to die

chorus 1 josh homme
bite your tongue
swear to keep your mouth shut

verse 2 josh homme with mark lanegan
ask yourself
will i burn in hell
then write it down
and cast it in the well
there they are
the mob it cries for blood
to twist the tale
into firewood
fan the flames
with a little lie
then turn your cheek
until the fire dies
the skin it peels
like the truth away
what it was
i will never say
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeinterlude

chorus 2 josh homme
bite your tongue swear to keep
keep your mouth shut
make up something make up something good

outro josh homme with mark lanegan
holdin hands
skippin like a stone
burn the witch
burn to ash and bone
burn the witch
burn to ash and bone
burn the witch
burn to ash and bone5embed"
