youre on the couch blowing up my phone
you dont want to come out but you dont want to be alone
it dont take but two to have a little soiree
if youre in the mood sit tight right where you are babe

verse 2
cause ill be at your door in ten minutes
whatever you got on girl stay in it
you aint gotta leave the house to have a good time
ima bring the good time home to you

chorus
well have a house party we dont need nobody
turn your tv off break that boombox out
well wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
and the cops show up and try to shut us down

postchorus
if youre gonna be a homebody
were gonna have a house party
if you wanna be a homebody
were gonna have a house party

verse 3
throw a neon tshirt over the lamp shade
ill take the furniture slide it out of the way
shaking the floor rattling the roof
well go to town right there in your living room
