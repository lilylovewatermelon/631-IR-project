fall

verse 1
now the dark begins to rise
save your breath
its far from over
leave the lost and dead behind
nows your chance to run for cover
i dont want to change the world
i just want to leave it colder
light the fuse and burn it up
take the path that leads to nowhere

prechorus
all is lost again
but im not giving in

chorus
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away

fall

verse 2
watch the end through dying eyes
now the dark is taking over
show me where forever dies
take the fall
and run to heaven

prechorus
all is lost again
but im not giving in

chorus
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away
and ill survive
paranoid
i have lost the will to change
and i am not proud
coldblooded fake
i will shut the world away
bridge
open your eyes

chorus
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away
and ill survive
paranoid
i have lost the will to change
and i am not proud
coldblooded fake
i will shut the world away
