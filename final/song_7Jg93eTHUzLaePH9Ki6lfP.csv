driving over the bridge to give you my keys
i know you dont love me i know it aint easy
friends become lovers and lovers lose friends
thats when the fog rolls in

hook
ooh ooh ooh im losing you
ooh ooh ooh youre losing me too

verse 2
in through the kitchen where we used to laugh
smells of your cooking sounds of the past
somehow we got older the air just got colder
thats when the fog rolls in

hook
ooh ooh ooh im losing you
ooh ooh ooh youre losing me too

bridge
so much for sewing up
so this is growing up
everythings going up for sale
the fog kept on rolling in
time came to sink or swim
they say its better to try and fail
and we tried like hell
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeverse 3
i take a deep breath with my hand on the door
afraid cause im not gonna see you anymore
these were our tender years this was our street
all of our stoplights and all our concrete
now its all somebody elses to take
until the fog rolls in

instrumental verse

outro
ooh ooh ooh and now were throughembed"
