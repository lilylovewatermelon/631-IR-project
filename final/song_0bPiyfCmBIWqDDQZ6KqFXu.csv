how are you today
i saw your friends band play
a little show last night
its not my thing they were alright
youre in my dream last week
id like to hear what you think
we passed a house driving fast
the sun was shining on the grass
you made me stop and leave the car
you pulled my sleeve but not too hard
remember when you took too much
i didnt mind being your crutch

chorus
we loved you then its not the same
i dont like how things change
i dont like how things change
i dont like how things change
i dont like how things change
i dont like how things change
