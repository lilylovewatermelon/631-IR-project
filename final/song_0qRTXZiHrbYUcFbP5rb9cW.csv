we knew the world would not be the same
few people laughed
few people cried
most people were silent
i remember the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavadgita
vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
and to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says
now i am become death the destroyer of worlds
i suppose we all thought that one way or another3embed"
