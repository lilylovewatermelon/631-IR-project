well my buckle makes impressions
on the inside of her thigh
there are little feathered indians
where we tussled through the night
if id known she was religious
then i wouldnt have came stoned
to the house of such an angel
too fucked up to get back home

verse 2
lookin over west virginia
smokin spirits on the roof
she asked aint anybody told ya
that them things are bad for you
i said many folks have warned me
theres been several people try
but up til now there aint been nothin
that i couldnt leave behind

chorus
hold me close my dear
sing your whisperin song
softly in my ear
and i will sing along
honey tell me how your love runs true
and how i can always count on you
to be there when the bullets fly
id run across the river just to hold you tonight
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 3
well my heart is sweatin bullets
from the circles it has raced
like a little feathered indian
callin out the clouds for rain
id go runnin through the thicket
id go careless through the thorns
just to hold her for a minute
though itd leave me wantin more

chorus
hold me close my dear
sing your whispering song
softly in my ear
and i will sing along
honey tell me how your love runs true
and how i can always count on you
to be there when the bullets fly
id run across the river just to hold you tonight2embed"
