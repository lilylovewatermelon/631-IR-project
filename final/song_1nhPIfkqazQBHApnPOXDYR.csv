lets go

verse 1
my first love was a chick from the sticks named geneva
had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
my mother never liked her my father didnt either
after 22 years i got eager and had to leave her
now im realizing how much i really need her
but something told me follow my heart and head eastwards
thats when i met brooklyn but brooklyn was a cheater
the second i turned my back jay and weezy tagteamed her
so i started packing she asked me what happened
told her i was leavin for her older sister manhattan
manhattan was into rap so we started chitchatting
and she was chinese italian black and a quarter latin
super high maintenance and way too into fashion
didnt even tell her piece and left her number on a napkin
damn but back then was back then
now i heard she went hollywood and began acting

chorus
oh ive been looking for love
in all the wrong places
oh somebody take me home
ive been falling in love
with all the wrong faces
oh somebody take me home
please take me home

and after manhattan i was acting silly
messing with a stick body jewel named philly
but that didnt work out too great
im vegetarian and all she ate was cheese steak
i went to baltimore for mary and almost got married man
but she was selfcentered always stuck in mary land
i knew a slim thing named virginia
i swear to god her bodys smoking but she kept gettin thinner
and ill never forget my first trissie
in the bins with the carolina twins gettin busy
i know they miss me but i had to leave early
on the 85 doin 85 ridin dirty
and my georgia piece savanna
used to stay in atlanta
accent so thick i couldnt even understand her
and thats when i realized
i damn near ran through the whole i95

chorus
oh ive been looking for love
in all the wrong places
oh somebody take me home
ive been falling in love
with all the wrong faces
oh somebody take me home
please take me home
verse 3
yeah then i met miami she was spanish
miami te amo me llamo travie
she could tell that i wasnt bilingual
i dont know todito but i know un poquito
we can hit south beach and drink mojitos
and maybe you can introduce me to your people
ha yo no voy pa tra
my first love keep on calling
you no voy pa ya
i think i finally found where imma stay
on i95
but never forget the 88 no

chorus
oh ive been looking for love
in all the wrong places
oh somebody take me home
ive been falling in love
with all the wrong faces
oh somebody take me home
please take me homeembed"
