he was my best friend
well i tried to help him
but he traded everything for suffering
and found himself alone
i watched the lying turn into hiding
with scars on both his lips his fingertips were melted to the bone

prechorus
but i can still remember what his face looked like
when i found him in an alley in the middle of the night
tell me what you know tell me what you gone and done now

chorus
tell me what you know tell me what you gone and done now
a gun would do the trick get it over with
youre better off
to take all youve got and burn it on the spot
to get highigh igh igh highigh igh igh

verse 2
three days no sleeping
well he gave up eating
he sold his mothers rings she said nothing
and pretended not to know
he started stealing to supply the feeling
found out he pulled a knife on someones wife
and held it to her throat

tell me what you did where you gone and hid
show me is what you really want watching what youve got
