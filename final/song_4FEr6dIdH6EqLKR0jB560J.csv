theres no sound
but the engines drone
our minds set free
to roam

prechorus
time shift
we discover the entry
to other planes

verse 2
our minds bend
and our fingers fold
entwined we dream
of unknown

prechorus
time shift
we discover the entry
to other planes

chorus
stay with me
as we cross the empty skies
come sail with me

we slow down
as the engines stall
our eyes catch sync
we explode

prechorus 2
time shift
we discover the entry
to other planes
time shift
as we collide with the energy
in other ways

chorus
stay with me
as we cross the empty skies
come sail with me

outro
we play in dreams
as we cross through
space and time
just stay with me12embed"
