i swear theres something in the wind outside today
and it aint cool
got me thinking bout how things decay
and about you

chorus
but ill be fine i have to set delay
before i try to fall in love not pain
yes ill be fine i just cant rush
not again not again no not again

spoken interlude
fuck why is falling in love so hard
i think im just moving too quickly
based on the patterns ive been studying on myself
of the most scientific research and i think
that i should just take things a little slower
you know ive learned a lot in experience
you know im grateful to be in this place right now ayy

verse 2
i swear theres something bout a loss there is to gain
perhaps a lesson
if you do it once dont do it again
unless its destined oh

but youll be fine you have to set delay
before you try to fall in love not pain
yes youll be fine you just cant rush
not again not again no not again1embed"
