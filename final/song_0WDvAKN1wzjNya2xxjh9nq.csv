if were the flagship of peace and prosperity
were taking on water and about to fucking sink
no one seems to notice no one even blinks
the crew left the passengers to die under the sea

chorus
countdown to the very end
equality an invitation that we wont extend
ready aim pull the trigger now
its time you firmly secure your place in hell

verse 2
state of the union address
reads war torn country still a mess
the words power death and distorted truth
are read between the lines of the red white and blue

chorus
countdown to the very end
equality an invitation that we wont extend
ready aim pull the trigger now
its time you firmly secure your place in hell
your place in hell
your place in hell
you might also likeoutro
guilty is what our graves will read
no year no family we did nothing nothing
to stop the murder of
of people just like us10embed"
