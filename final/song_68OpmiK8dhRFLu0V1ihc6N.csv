to me you were sort of scary
but you seemed to like me
and it dont happen that much

so i threw caution to the wind
gave you one halfhearted grin
thats all that it took
for you to try your luck

how was i to know you run hot and cold
that youd get inside my mind

level one you played me two you paused me
three i realized
your high score show your cheats dont work
your three lives up bad luck now its game over

this is how its gonna be
thats what you chose to be believe
made me stay in while
you went out with all your friends

i was advised to walk away
but you blinded me enough to stay
im through with all your lies
and this is where it ends
you might also likeyeah you played to win i was taken in
but now you are out of time

level one you played me two you paused me
three i realized
your high score show cheats the word
your three lives up bad luck now its game over

no repeat chance you blew it
you get no more clues
now youre all out of special moves
too bad you lose

level one you played me two you paused me
three i realized
your high score show your cheats dont work
your three lives up bad luck now its game over

level one you played me two you paused me
three i realized
your high score show your cheats dont work
your three lives up bad luck now its game overembed"
