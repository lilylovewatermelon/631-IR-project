we saw you from the urchins side from under the boat
we saw you making knots we saw you get the rope
the boy appearing on the deck youre making it lurch
the bubble of your interests ready to burst

prechorus
he whistles and he runs

verse 2
we saw you in distraction a sleeping slow despair
rehearsing interaction he wasnt even there
a creature is a creature though you wish you were the wind
the boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end

chorus
he whistles and he runs so hold him fast
breathe the burn you want to let it last
he might succumb to what you havent seen
he has a keen eye for what you used to be
when the cadaverous mob saves their doors for the dead men
you cannot leave
when the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead men
you cannot leave

outro
when the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead men
you cannot leavesee interpol liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like3embed"
