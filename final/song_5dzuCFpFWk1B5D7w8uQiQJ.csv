theres a picture of you on my dresser
and its been there since you said goodbye
and when i look in its direction
youre strain my heart straight in the eye

chorus
it just sits there smiling at me
taking me back in time
and before i know it
im all caught up in
that old frame of mine

verse 2
i wish i could tear it to pieces
and ive tried with all of my might
but somehow i cant find courage
oh to let you out of my sight

chorus
it just sits there smiling at me
taking me back in time
and before i know it
im all caught up in
that old frame of mine

im all caught up in
