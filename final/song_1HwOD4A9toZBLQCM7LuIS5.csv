when will it ever end and when will my life begin

verse 1
no sweat no regrets run down my back
a fine line just right before i crack
oh man to see me and then wave your finger up in my face
believing in what you say and promising another day

chorus
will it ever end when will my life begin
all this built up pain forever plaguing me
its the last time its my lifeline
its the last time that ill be forever shamed

verse 2
no breath and disrespecting all my time
dividing and speaking out of line
tell me the reason oh everybody needs to feel your pain
so draw the line back to me
and save me from insanity

chorus
will it ever end when will my life begin
all this built up pain forever plaguing me
its the last time its my lifeline
its the last time that ill be forever shamed
