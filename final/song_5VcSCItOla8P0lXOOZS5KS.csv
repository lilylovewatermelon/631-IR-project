tha shooting name is wayne
the victim didnt complain she just screamed shoot again
i gave her extra rounds my barrel twist around
i am mr shoot em down i leave hearts on tha ground

then i let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
i never shoot and tell i only shoot to kill
and the vest aint gonna help it even if its made of steel
