why is it that you could only see the worst in me
i swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
but to keep it all real its kinda hurtin me
i could say im done with it but it lurks in me
so ima just tell myself that it works for me
take a real long drive in the mercedes
and i might pop a couple of them percoces
yeah thatll make me transform to hercules

prechorus
i am who i am
ah

chorus
here i am here i am
so take me as i am
here i am here i am
so take me as i am
here i am here i am
so take me as i am

postchorus
i am who i am

i swear to god man everything in life is old
and the only thing that changed is the price of gold
even in the afterlife ima fight your soul
cause the second time around ill be twice as bold
so do you take me to be who i am
to have and to hold til death do us part
cause if not its just best we both part
cause how am i supposed to finish what you start
you got me thinkin twice to just breathe i am
then you say i wont survive if i leave who i am
but i got a couple of tricks up my sleeve ah
i no longer need your attention at ease
