from the day you arrived
ive remained by your side
in chains entombed

placed inside
safe and sound
shapes and colors
are all i see

verse 2
on the day you arrived
i became your device
to name and soothe

chorus
placed inside
safe and sound
shapes and colors
are all i see
shades of colors
are all i feel
