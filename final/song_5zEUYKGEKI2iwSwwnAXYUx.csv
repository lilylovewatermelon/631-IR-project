verse
muhfuckas yall want war with the god cmon yall know better
i put holes in ya leather reknit your sweater
and i bet the flows wetter than ocean front property
better come at me properly
niggas better off poppin me but i believe
yall scared to clap them hammers
and the fact that im unpredictable gives me the advantage
what the fuck am im speakin spanish niggas
what i got to tell yall in detail how we murder niggas
handle ya business
the inc is religious murders the sacrifice
we throwin ms niggas that means murder for life
and ill die for that red and black
that house with the cheddar stack and the smiles on my kids faces
what could replace this
this lil nigga here done come to grips with death to taste it
my airs thick and filled with hatred
surprise of that look in my eyes but dont be
im just following the footsteps the lord done pave me
if i go crazily insane
ima blame it on the world look what i became
cause they give me all the fame and the money mayne
made me an icon
so the world can catch a nigga with his lights on
thats the pros and cons ya never quite free
but just gimme a lil room so i can breathe
and my pain gon be the death of me
but to be loved is my destiny my black people
