hey porter hey porter
would you tell me the time
how much longer will it be til we cross
that masondixon line
at daylight would ya tell that engineer
to slow it down
or better still just stop the train
cause i want to look around

verse 2
hey porter hey porter
what time did you say
how much longer will it be til i
can see the light of day
when we hit dixie will you tell that engineer
to ring his bell
and ask everybody that aint asleep
to stand right up and yell

verse 3
hey porter hey porter
its getting light outside
this old train is puffing smoke
and i have to strain my eyes
but ask that engineer if he
will blow his whistle please
cause i smell frost on cotton leaves
and i feel that southern breeze

hey porter hey porter
please get my bags for me
i need nobody to tell me now
that were in tennessee
go tell that engineer to make
that lonesome whistle scream
were not so far from home
so take it easy on the steam

break

verse 5
hey porter hey porter
please open up the door
when they stop the train im gonna get off first
cause i cant wait no more
tell that engineer i said thanks a lot
and i didnt mind the fare
im going to set my feet on southern soil
and breathe that southern air2embed"
