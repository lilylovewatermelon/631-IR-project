she was sittin all alone over on the tailgate
tan legs swingin by a georgia plate
i was lookin for her boyfriend
thinkin no way she aint got one
soon as i sat down i was fallin in love
tryin to pour a little sugar in her dixie cup
talkin over the speakers in the back of that truck
she jumped up and cut me off

chorus
she was like oh my god this is my song
ive been listenin to the radio all night long
sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
she was like come here boy i wanna dance
fore i said a word she was takin my hand
spinnin me around til it faded out
and she gave me a kiss
and she said play it again play it again play it again
and i said play it again play it again play it again

verse 2
id gave that dj my last dime
if he would have played it just one more time
but a little while later
we were sittin in the drive in my truck
before i walked her to the door
i was scannin like a fool am fm xm too
but i stopped real quick when i heard that groove
man you should have seen her light up
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
she was like oh my god this is my song
weve been listenin to the radio all night long
i cant believe that it came back on but here it is
she was like come here boy i wanna dance
fore i said a word she was takin my hand
spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
and i said play it again play it again play it again

bridge
and she said play it again play it again play it again
the next friday night we were sittin out under the stars
you should have seen her smile when i broke out my guitar

chorus
she was like oh my god this is my song
ive been listenin to the radio all night long
sittin round waitin for it to come on and here it is
she was like come here boy i wanna dance
fore i said a word she was takin my hand
spinnin in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
and she said play it again play it again play it again
and i said play it again play it again play it again

outro
yeah play it again play it again play it again
she said somebody play it again play it again play it again40embed"
