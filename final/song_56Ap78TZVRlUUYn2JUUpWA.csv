means nothing if were dead
and as i sink into the earth
youll be ripe inside my head
when i come out to dance
ill just kiss you instead
youre my cold skin goddess
aphrodite in red
punched a hole through a wall
that i couldnt break
my knuckles bled out the sadness
from a pain i couldnt take
when my stomachs warm
i can read the things you make
but when my eyes start to water
i am a mistake

i tried so hard to be the one that you would think about
while youre away at school
i was never one to be remembered whyd i think that
it would change now

the faint reminder that youre gone is growing
i can feel the sadness from my inside showing
when will you break this silence
all i want is to be freeyou might also like2embed"
