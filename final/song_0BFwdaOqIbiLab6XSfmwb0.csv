my heart is frozen
my souls been broken
the whole worlds on my motherfucking shoulders
and i cant seem to control it

i cant contain it
and i just dont give a shit
you need to feel the way that i feel
or youll never fucking know it

chorus
burn motherfucker
burn motherfucker burn
you try but you cant reach me
burn motherfucker
burn motherfucker burn
theres nothing you can teach me

in hell motherfucker
burn motherfucker burn
i swear youre out to get me
burn motherfucker
burn motherfucker burn
id live but you wont let me
burn
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likeverse 2
your lifes been wasted
youll die forsaken
you act like the worlds on your shoulders
but its not there so you fake it

do you embrace it
how do you take it
ill never feel the way that you feel
id rather fucking break it

chorus
