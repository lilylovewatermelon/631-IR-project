taking over this town they should worry
but these problems aside i think i taught you well
that we wont run and we wont run and we wont run

verse 1 nanna nanna  ragnar
and in the winter night sky ships are sailing
looking down on these bright blue city lights
and they wont wait and they wont wait and they wont wait
were here to stay were here to stay were here to stay

chorus nanna  ragnar
howling ghosts they reappear
in mountains that are stacked with fear
but youre a king and im a lionheart
a lionheart

verse 2 nanna nanna  ragnar
his crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
though far away though far away though far away
were still the same were still the same were still the same

chorus nanna  ragnar
howling ghosts they reappear
in mountains that are stacked with fear
but youre a king and im a lionheart
and in the sea thats painted black
creatures lurk below the deck
but youre a king and im a lionheart
and as the world comes to an end
ill be here to hold your hand
cause youre my king and im your lionheart
