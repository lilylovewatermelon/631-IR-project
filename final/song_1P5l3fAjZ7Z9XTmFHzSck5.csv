save your breath dont even speak on me now
you and your friends ran my name to the ground
you left me then so i figured it out
save your tongue dont even give me a call
if i was a bum you wouldnt call me at all
i dont say it enough im gettin tired of yall

chorus
ohh you say youre so happy for me
that you always knew what i would be
where was the love when it was needed
ohh you say that now im all you see
and you always saw the light in me
where was the light when it was needed

verse 2
why you feel the need to apologize to me oh yeah
some may call it out i just call it how i see
loved me when you knew me you just aint want anybody to know
i changed my number twice and you called again
heard that i was movin and asked all my friends where to
if i dont wanna be close its nothing personal

chorus
ohh you say youre so happy for me
said you always knew what i would be
where was the love when it was needed
ohh you say that now im all you see
and you always saw the light in me
where was the light when it was needed

chorus
ohh you say youre so happy for me
