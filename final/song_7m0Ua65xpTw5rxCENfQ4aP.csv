he said son hold it still
keep that beam shining straight
he’d have a 916ths in one hand
working on that chevrolet
it seemed like every saturday
soon as the sun went down
we’d be huddled underneath that hood
tinkering around
and of all of the great memories i’ve had
the best ones are those nights just me and my dad

chorus
he’ll never know how much he taught me
out in that garage
and i guess the stuff that stuck
was more about life than fixing cars
cause to this day i still can’t make them run right
but i sure did learn a lot
just holding the flashlight

verse 2
he told me a lot of stories
about grandpa and the war
while he was trying to show me
what a carburator’s for
i learned a couple cuss words
when he skinned his knuckles up
and i found out momma was the only girl
he ever really loved
then i asked him about women he just laughed
said if we stayed out here all year
we wouldn’t have time enough for that

he’ll never how much he taught me
out in that garage
and i guess the stuff that stuck
was more about life than fixing cars
cause to this day i still can’t make them run right
but i sure did learn a lot
just holding the flashlight

outro
and to this day i still can’t make them run right
but deep inside i know that it’s alright
cause i sure learned a lot
just holding the flashlight
