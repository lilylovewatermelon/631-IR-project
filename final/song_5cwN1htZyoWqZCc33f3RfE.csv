were bound to wait all night
shes bound to run amok
invested enough in it anyhow
and to each his own
the garden is sorting out
she curls her lips on a barrel
i dont know if youre dead or not
if youre anyone

prechorus
come on and get the minimum
before you open up your eyes
this army has so many heads
to analyze
come on and get your overdose
collect it at the borderline
and they want to get up in your head

chorus
cause they know and so do i
the high road is hard to find
a detour in your new life
tell all of your friends goodbye

verse 2
the dawn to end all nights
thats all we hoped it was
a break from the warfare in your house
but to each his own
a soldier is bailing out
and curled his lips on the barrel
and i dont know if the dead can talk
to anyone

come on and get the minimum
before you open up your eyes
this army has so many heads
are you one of us
come on and get your overdose
collect it at the borderline
and they want to get up in your head

chorus
cause they know and so do i
the high road is hard to find
a detour in your new life
tell all of your friends goodbye

outro
its too late to change your mind
youve let loss be your guide
its too late to change your mind
youve let loss be your guide
its too late to change your mind
youve let loss be your guide
its too late to change your mind
youve let loss be your guide18embed"
