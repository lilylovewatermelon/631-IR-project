big ol strap like im a haitian

chorus
could you send me a flick ima send you a dick pic when im horny
if i kiss you on yo lips would you tell your sisters in the mornin
would you keep it a secret like i aint felt this way before
wanna tell you that i like you but i dont cause im not sure
i just take her heart and score then i love her til she sore
i just break her heart in fours then i dont want her anymore
if i eat it could i treat it could i beat it with my sword
she want love and i want war

postchorus

if i hit that thing the right way can i take you to my prom
wanna strap you round to my waist and come take you to my mom
