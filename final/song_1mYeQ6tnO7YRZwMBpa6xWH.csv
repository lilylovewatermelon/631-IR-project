verse 1
bad moon rising horses running gravel flying
thats what ive been thinking ever since you walked in
i got a feeling we could get this dive bar talking
bad moon rising horses running gravel flying

chorus
hell bound you and i
chase a little trouble with some whiskey on ice
kiss the past goodbye
im a shotgun bonnie im your getaway clyde
well ride
ride this night like a one way track
live or die
if youre all mine ima never look back

mmmh ima never look back

verse 2
