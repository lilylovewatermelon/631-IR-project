she said go ahead and get out
low down dirty beats
you better hold your tongue boy you better not even speak

chorus
you’ve been fooling
you’ve been fooling around
then i go and get your train ticket cause you so out of line
outta line outta line
outta line outta line
i know something happened
when you came home half past nine
outta line outta line
you so outta line
you better come up with a quick plan to change this mind of mine
