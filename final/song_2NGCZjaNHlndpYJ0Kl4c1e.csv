lord you know
ive cried a thousand tears tonight
but nothing seems to quench
the thirst you keep on craving
but now i need an answer to my prayers and youre not there
so why think you listen
listen

chorus
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
and everyone keeps trying to take that all away
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
your cries

verse 2
lord i cant disguise
the look inside my eyes
the more i try to look away
the more im staring
but now i need an answer to my prayers and youre not there
so why think you listen
listen

chorus
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
and everyone keeps trying to take that all away
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
your cries

your cries in vain
your cries in vain
your cries in vain
your cries in vain
i look away

chorus
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
and everyone keeps trying to take that all away
has no one told you your cries are all in vain
your cries

outro
has nobody told you when you look away
the stories they told you still run through your veins
has nobody told you when you look away
the stories they told you still run through your
