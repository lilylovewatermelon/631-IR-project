talkin bout that fake shit
oh that fake love that slippery slimy that snake shit
but i cant let up
but i cant let up

verse 1
5 oclock on the dot i hear my cell phone
like kaash whats up what is b on
like let me let you up
girl you wont believe what i just heard
what you hear what you know
bro she a hoe she on the other line
please dont let her know
just keeping it real with you
so this bitch dont get comfortable
oh she sorry now
girl you know you let me down
hit you when im back in town
cause i heard that you been gettin round
now you worthless
i hope she was worth it
not saying that we perfect
you not the one thats hurting

chorus

oh that fake love that slippery slimy that snake shit that snake shit
fake friends on a row
switching up cut em off

talkin bout that fake shit
when youre negative and complaining with the same shit
thats your prerogative

i mow the lawn theres still snakes in my garden
and i been bit before so gotta remain cautious

chorus
