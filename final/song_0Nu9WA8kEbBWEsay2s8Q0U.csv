way back on the radio dial
the fire got lit inside a brighteyed child
every note just wrapped around his soul
from steel guitars to memphis all the way to rock and roll

chorus
oh i can hear em playin
i can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
oh i can hear em singin
keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart

verse 2
downtown is where i used to wander
old enough to get there but too young to get inside
so i would stand out on the sidewalk
listen to the music playin every friday night

chorus
oh i can hear em playin
i can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
oh i can hear em singin
keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart

verse 3
some dreams stay with you forever
drag you around but bring you back to where you were
some dreams keep on gettin better
you gotta keep believin if you wanna know for sure

oh i can hear em playin
i can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar

oh i can hear em playin
i can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar
oh i can hear em singin
keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
