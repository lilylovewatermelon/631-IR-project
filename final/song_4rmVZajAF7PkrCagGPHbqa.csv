you say i changed i say that i millioned i did
the toughest act to follows back on tour
offroad maybach pyrex trap
virgil came back through the boy damn
thats somethin to me niggas really had they back turned to me
i aint talkin my assistant when i say niggas down to pack somethin for me
then they thought they had the trap set for me
how you really think that went for me
niggas gotta do a fact check for me
when everything is put to rest
and everybody takes a breath
and everything gets addressed
its you alone with your regrets
all that pumpin up your chest
all that talk about the best
you know how sticky it gets

like something happened11embed"
