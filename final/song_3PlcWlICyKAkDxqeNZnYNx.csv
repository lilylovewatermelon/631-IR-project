crawl
crawl over me
take what you can
waste
waste everything
hidden beneath your plans

walked on
taking advantage of my love
you only care about yourself
have you ever thought about how i feel
so used and worn down

verse 2
drain
drain my head
i dont want to feel anymore

guitar solo

prechorus
silently choking on my words

walked on
taking advantage of my love
you only care about yourself
have you ever thought about how i feel
so used and worn downembed"
