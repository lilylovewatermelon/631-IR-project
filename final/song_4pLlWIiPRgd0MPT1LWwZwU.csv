try not to talk when theres nothing to say
kept bottled up we get carried away
then i fall then i fall down then we fall down
and you know that it makes me feel so ridiculous
a pocket full of posies we fall

chorus
down on the inside pretty on the outside
turn it around can we turn it around
try to make a comeback with nowhere to start from now
but its looking up

verse 2
a second chance a much better day
a sunset that just wont go away
then i fall then i fall down we all fall down
and you know that it makes me feel so ridiculous
a pocket full of posies we fall

chorus
down on the inside pretty on the outside
turn it around can we turn it around
try to make a comeback with nowhere to start from now
but its looking up
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
and you know you said youd never end up this way
close the door behind you i just wanna stay for a while
stay for a while with you
we all fall down we all fall down we all fall down

chorus
down on the inside pretty on the outside
turn it around can we turn it around
try to make a comeback with nowhere to start from now

chorus
down on the inside pretty on the outside
turn it around can we turn it around
try to make a comeback with nowhere to start from now
but its looking up

outro
its looking up
and you know you said youd never end up this way
its looking up
a pocket full of posies can i stay for a while
its looking up
its looking up
