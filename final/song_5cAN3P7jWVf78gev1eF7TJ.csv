and we took ls for sure but in chicago they know we winnin for sure
you do it for what you better not say that you do it for d boom them niggas be tucked
that nigga was fucked the moment he ran and he knew he aint duckin his ass out of luck
we do it for von we dont wait til it die down we load and we do it tomorrow
we do it on feet ask all the opps about us and who say we shoot out the cars

anything close to a dub and a younginll walk for a hundred he damn near get caught

catch him out and we handle the business
i aint gettin in no nigga business
thirty million my mind in the trenches still
fuck her good make her nigga not turn her on
they got brodie on camera he comin home
run it up from a scale to a microphone
treat dior like a muhfuckin nike store
and you know he aint that why you hype him up
any time we have smoke its just pipe me up
never know the outcome til you try your luck
get whatever you want when im tryna fuck
and we tellin nobody cant fuck with us
put the four in the p with the fuckin f
i should never bring the pain on my fuckin self
really need it if i ever ask for help
i just know ima blow if its life or death
i made all them hoes drink never left
im way higher im up in my altitude
i was broke i woke up with an attitude
now you play with the kid he embarrass you
i jump right in the field with no parachute and one pair of shoes3embed"
