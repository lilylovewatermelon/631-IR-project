she locked her fingers and bowed her head
she said im late and im really scared
now you can go but i hope you stay
im gonna keep it either way

chorus
in my daddys el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through that windshield
i could see my future change
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a baby
but it takes a man to raise a child

verse 2
i laid my head down on the wheel
she said i know i know it dont seem real
she closed her eyes but the tears flowed through
she said dont hate me for loving you

chorus
in my daddys el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through that windshield
i could see my future change
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a baby
but it takes a man to raise a child

oh i could not reassure her
i couldnt say what i had planned
couldnt put three words together
so i just took her hand

chorus
in my daddys el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through that windshield
i could see my future change
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a babyembed"
