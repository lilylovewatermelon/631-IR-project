im going to write a tear stained letter
im going to mail it straight to you
im going to bring back to your mind
what you said about always being true
about our secret hiding places
being daily satisfied
i can see you sitting and reading it
while you hang you head and cry
i just hope youre not so sad
youre going to go down suicide
im going to write a tear stained letter
put it special delivery
because its gonna be full of stuff
thats only known to you and me
about how every time i get turned on
you turn me off and bring me down
itll be about the darkest news
that ever did arrive in your hometown
itll be about the saddest thing
your mailman ever did bring around
im going to write a tear stained letter
im going to tell you one more time
that you still could reconsider
and come back to being mine
and if you think about what im saying
itd be hard to refuse
just be sure you think a long time
on the answer that you choose
it will be a most important piece
of personal private news
im going to write a tear stained letter
mark it personal private news
and i hope youll keep it to yourself
and dont go around crying the blues
giving off a bad impression
as to what went really wrong
when what it was was that suddenly
the music was all gone
and this man and this woman got cut off
in the middle of our song
im going to write a tear stained letter
im going to put it to a tune
so ill be sending with it
a sweet melody for you
and not some redhot upbeat zinger
thatll set your body on fire
but a hunk of love included
meant to take you a little higher
and to settle on your sweet sweet mind
at night when you retire
