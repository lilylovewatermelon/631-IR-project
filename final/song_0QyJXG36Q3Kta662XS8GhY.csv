people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me
people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me

verse 1
living at the speed of light like a bullet
i could be dead by the morning
i cant call it
so i aint got no time to wait wait it out
ive been down and out for too long
and i aint got too many options

refrain
people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me
people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me

verse 2
still alive but if my heart broke
i could be dead by tomorrow
hes got eyes on me
hell take me soon
hes making room
always hated lines
i aint got much to lose

people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me
people say i drive too fast move too fast live too fast
aint no such thing as too fast for me

bridge
living at the speed of light
its hard to follow
i could be dead by tomorrow
trying to face it
so i aint got time to wait it out
ive been down and out for too long
no such thing as too fast for me
no such thing as too fast for me

verse 3
i called on you you were needed
you went mia today and i aint see ya
i thought of you while i was working
im too proud to look for you
i hope youre hurting

outro
tell me what i got to prove
while i was working
i dont mean nothing to you
i hope youre hurting
you aint got nothing to say
while i was working
youre too good at walking away
i hope youre hurting21embed"
