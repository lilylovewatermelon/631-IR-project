pharrells a pharaoh peep the features
unlaced adidas
top of the world like pyramids in giza

maybach 3 tvs all up in the headrest
mace niggas at madison square garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges

hoop earrings coupes with the rear cameras

versace plates got the basquiat

your life is illegal when your chain can get the rico
real niggas all feel the hook
