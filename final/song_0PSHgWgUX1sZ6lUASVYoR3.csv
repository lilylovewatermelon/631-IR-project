beat title priority gunna type

she wanna toast
i wanna meal
i got the strap and no its not concealed
i came from living in hell and making a sale
to government navy seals
play with me i dont play forreal
never sold out for a deal
never sold out for a single moment
i just been keeping it real
dirty south with a trill
x2

still with a pill
seroquel in my quill
yeah i took notes no bail
yeah i want smoke no jail
yeah i drop prose im pro forreal
like jim jones i made my mills
all off the books like booked by 12
all of the crooks know i dont tell
all of the sharks know im a whale
you might also likeswimming mac miller i kill and drill
popping pills with fentanill
new spray paint i signed my will
nike game go noctarnill
im awake i got the skill
like a saw i saw the wheel
in the sky journey my chill
paul wall pt on my grill
i cpt compton bill
not gon squeal
never told i made a stamp a seal
usa i press the wheel
dvds on my email
keep it reel
like its ig like im phil
i called uncle rick the real
i shake the earth my richter scale
down to dirt this angel fell
here on earth my purpose will
be revealed
pray to god he help me heal
pray to allah like a sunni
soon ill have more rap appeal
shia been in shit so long
its time to sail
this an ocean imma delve
i am such a killer whale
i am ready for the sale
slaves all over on a bill
77 age of gill
hallows hallowed ground i till
spooky season if you need a reason
i just shoot to thrill
what a stupid setup
what a major corporill
what a major generill
ai generate my fill
everything i need a screen assail
tattoo face like nazerdine brazil
met the maker made you still
aint no respect in your veil
all i knew was scout the land
its time the martian reconceal
march like world war number 12
steps i step on neck cecil
sicilians in my grill
i just needed louis venus will
yums like serena just chill
seen her secret victory of will
freemason i made the brick appeal
the secret lies with charlotte still
3am and 8am i need the hiphop in my pel
vis like michael vick deville
cruella with intentions ill
bear the truth on window sills
grandma just moved on to bill
lifes a bitch and im addicted pills
lithium my meals
depakote i spoke it well
stay woke i hope i prevail
came up from a vacuum seal
she wanna toast
i wanna meal
i got the strap and no its not concealed
i came from living in hellembed"
