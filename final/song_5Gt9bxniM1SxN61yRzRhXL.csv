intro kendrick lamar sam dew  whitney alford
i hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
tell them tell em tell them the truth
i hope you find some paradise
tell em tell em the truth
tell em tell em tell em tell em your—
ive been goin through somethin
onethousand eighthundred and fiftyfive days
ive been goin through somethin
be afraid

verse 1 kendrick lamar
what is a bitch in a miniskirt
a man in his feelings with bitter nerve
what is a woman that really hurt
a demon youre better off killing her
what is a relative making repetitive narratives
on how you did it first
that is a predator hit reverse
all of your presidents evil thirst
what is a neighborhood reptable
that is a snitch on a pedestal
what is a house with a better view
a family broken in variables
what is a rapper with jewelry
a way that i show my maturity
what if i call on security
that mean im calling on god for purity
i went and got me a therapist
i can debate on my theories and sharing it woah
consolidate all my comparisons
humblin up because time was imperative woah
started to feel like its only one answer
to everything i dont know where it is woah
popping a bottle of claritin woah
is it my head or my arrogance woah
shaking and moving like what am i doing
im flipping my time through the rolodex
indulging myself and my life and my music
the world that im in is a culdesac
the world that we in is just menacing
the demons portrayed as religionous
i wake in the morning another appointment
i hope the psychologist listenin

chorus kendrick lamar
the new mercedes with black gwagon
the where you from it was all for rap
i was 28 years young twenty mill in tax
bought a couple of mansions just for practice
five hundred in jewelry chain was magic
never had it in public late reaction
50k to cousins post a caption
pray none of my enemies hold me captive

refrain kendrick lamar
i grieve different
i grieve different huh

verse 2 kendrick lamar
i met her on the third night of chicago
north america tour my enclave
feefifofum she was a model
dedicated to the songs i wrote and the bible
eyes like green penetratin the moonlight
hair done in a bun energy in the room like
big bang for theory god hopin you hear me
phone off the ringer tell the world im busy
fair enough green eyes said her mother didnt care enough
sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
her first brother got killed he was twentyone
i was nine when they put lamont in the grave
heartbroken when estelle didnt say goodbye
chad left his body after we facetimed
green eyes said youd be okay first tour sex the pain away
refrain kendrick lamar
i grieve different
i grieve different huh

chorus kendrick lamar
the new mercedes with black gwagon
the where you from it was all for rap
i was 28 years young twenty mill in tax

pray none of my enemies hold me captive

verse 3 kendrick lamar
so what paralyzed the county building controlled us
i bought a rolex watch i only wore it once
i bought infinity pools i never swimmed in
i watched keem buy four cars in four months
you know the family dynamics on repeat
the insecurities locked down on pc
i bought a 223 nobody peace treat
you wont doodoo me i smell tnt
dave got him a porsche so i got me a porsche
paid lottery for it i aint want it in portions
poverty was the case
but the money wipin the tears away
outro kendrick lamar
i grieve different
everybody grieves different
everybody grieves different
i grieve different huh63embed"
