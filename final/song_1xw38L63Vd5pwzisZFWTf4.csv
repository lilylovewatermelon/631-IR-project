dear georgia
i couldnt make my way to california
i just needed something a little closer than too far
just a county line apart
were wishin on the same old smalltown stars

verse 2
and im sorry
if i ever turned my back on anybody
wasnt worth it looking back on all the parties that ive been
and all the places that i went
so i wrote this song for you and all my friends yeah

chorus
oh aint nothing but one interstate road
from anywhere we wanna call home
and right now its tennessee
but no matter where i go youll always be
my dear georgia
dear georgia mmhmm mm

verse 3
well i miss you
yeah im rollin right through nowhere west virginia
and i keep thinking about you lately
and i meant to tell you how much i wish i was there right now
close my eyes and see the pines that lead me on my way back south
