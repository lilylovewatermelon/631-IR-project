verse 1 zayn
cant believe youre packing your bags
trying so hard not to cry
had the best time and now its the worst time
but we have to say goodbye

prechorus 1 harry
dont promise that youre gonna write
dont promise that youll call
just promise that you wont forget we had it all

verse 2 louis
wish that we could be alone now
if we could find some place to hide
make the last time just like the first time
push a button and rewind
