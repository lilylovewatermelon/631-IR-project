higher higher higher

verse 1 calum
i thought we had a place just our place
our home base my headspace
was you and i always
but that phase has been phased in our place
i see it on your face a small trace
a blank slate weve been erased

prechorus calum
but if were way too faded to drive
you can stay one more night

chorus calum
we said wed both love harder than we knew we could go
but still the hardest part is knowin when to let go
you wanted to go higher higher higher
burnt too bright now the fires gone
watch it all fall down babylon

postchorus calum
babylon

my halftruths are not amused
i wish we had a clue to start new
a white moon no residue
the colour of our mood is so rude
a cold june were not immune

but if were way too faded to fight
you can stay one more night
