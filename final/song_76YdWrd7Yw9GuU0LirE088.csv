i cant get my mind out of those memories
now time to tell them dont take my dream
still music keeps on turning me from the words that hurt my soul
removing doubts from my mind

chorus
those long days passing by from that door like late summer they slowly fade away
finding ways through the favorite tune playing all day with my eyes closed

those long days passing by from that door like late summer they slowly fade away
finding ways through the favorite tune filling me with those sounds

verse 2
i cant remember the smile that you gave it to me
i have no way to tell you dont walk away
still sorrow keeps on tying me but my soul wants to get free
let my heart loose from a chain

chorus
those long days passing by from that door like frail snow they slowly disappear
finding ways through the favorite thoughts cocoon me in floaty bliss

those long days passing by from that door like frail snow they slowly disappear
finding ways through the favorite friends filling me with warm embrace
you might also likethose long days passing by from that door like late summer they slowly fade away
finding ways through the favorite tune playing all day with my eyes closed

those long days passing by from that door like late summer they slowly fade away
finding ways through the favorite tune filling me with those soundsembed"
