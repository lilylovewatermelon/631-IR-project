good kid bad brains livin for whatever
tight rope no chains holdin it together
but its hard to see clouds when youre six feet underground
keep building a house then tearing it down

and it goes on on
it goes on dumb coconut cant break it open

youre only 16 goin on forever
take it easy tiger
dumb coconut cant break it open
easy tiger
only 16 goin on forever
easy tiger
youre only 16 goin on forever

verse 2 john gourley
no rain clear skies at least i got the weather
bought in sold out finger up to heaven
cause i still see your face gettin lost in the crowd
an i still hear the sound of the pack when they howl
