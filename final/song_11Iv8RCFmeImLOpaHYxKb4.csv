when you gonna stop breaking my heart
i dont wanna be another one
paying for the things i never done
dont let go dont let go to my love

verse 1 vika jigulina with edward maya
can i get to your soul can you get to my flow
can we promise we wont let go
all the things that i need all the things that you need
you can make it feel so real
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i touch your body i feel im losing control
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i see you baby i just dont wanna let go

bridge vika jigulina
when you gonna stop breaking my heart
i dont wanna be another one
paying for the things i never done
dont let go dont let go to my love

prechorus edward maya
i came to see you but i just might go overboard tonight
i came to see you but i might go inside
