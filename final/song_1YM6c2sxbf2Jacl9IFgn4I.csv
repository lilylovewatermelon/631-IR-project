chorus
abandon all ships its about to go down
no titanic titanic
theres a lot going on in my head right now
but i manage yeah i manage
good heart good soul both been in bad hands
i could deal damage yeah real damage
both hands in the air as i scream out prayers
my demons show their face in the midnight air

verse 1
just got a new house gotta hide the skeletons in the closet
and keep em there really tryna forget about em
they tell me god watchin over me i dont doubt it
but i can see him gettin tired of me sinnin and wildin
dont know what to do with myself these days
young rich nigga i done fell in love with the bank
but all this money dont rid me of my pain
but everywhere i go i could make it precipitate rain
