place is packed having a blast
take a sip leave a tip get to throwing them back
nothing but a few beers on my mind
then the door swings open i looked left
you in that red dress dagger through my chest
there goes my good time

chorus
wheres a corner booth when i need one
a little spot i can hide where the neon dont hit me
making it easy for everyone to know you aint here with me
all i want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
forget this damn night and everything weve ever done
wheres a corner booth when i need one

verse 2
itd just make it worse if you knew it hurt
and seen me sneaking out the backdoor now
looks like ill be hanging around
i try not to stare or wonder if you care
hell i dont even know if you know im here
or that im dodging you through the crowd

chorus
wheres a corner booth when i need one
a little spot i can hide where the neon dont hit me
making it easy for everyone to know you aint here with me
all i want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
forget this damn night and everything weve ever done
wheres a corner booth when i need one
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
maybe one in the back with the sear torn
where the smokes so thick you cant even see the dancefloor
cause i know youre on the dancefloor baby

chorus
wheres a corner booth when i need one
a little spot i can hide where the neon dont hit me
making it easy for everyone to know you aint here with me
all i want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
forget this damn night and everything weve ever done
wheres a corner booth when i need one
when i need oneembed"
