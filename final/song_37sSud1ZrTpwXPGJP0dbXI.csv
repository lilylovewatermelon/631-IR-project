they say in chess youve got to kill the queen and then youve made it
oh i do you
a funny thing a king who gets himself assassinated
hey now every time i lose altitude

verse 2
you took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated
oh i do you
now put away your welcome soon youll find youve overstayed it
hey now every time i lose altitude

chorus
so divine hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune faded

verse 3
the medicated state of mind youve found is overrated
oh i do you
you saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it
hey now every time i lose altitude

chorus
so divine hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune faded
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likebridge
come on god do i seem bulletproof

chorus
so divine hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune faded
so divine hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune faded6embed"
