interlude
when you wake up your whole worlds flipped
its just different and you gotta you know you gotta you gotta go with it
and thats just simply growing up
and not see it in a negative way
you have to see it as its been given to you
i mean as much as times can be crazy
youre gonna feel like thats where youre supposed to be
youre not going to feel out of place anymore
youre going to feel like thats where you meant to be
you dont have to pretend that its easy all the time
you just let it go and and grow with it
and you cant hold on to the old you or the old this or the old that
because you know you change and its not changing in a bad way
its just changing because thats what happens in life
you grow up everyone moves on
youre just learning
you stay true to yourself
changing isnt a bad thing it never was
but at the end of the day you know
youre the same person
and and where your heart is
that doesnt change
