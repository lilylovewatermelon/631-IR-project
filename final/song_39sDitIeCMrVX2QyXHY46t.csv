she asked me how to be funny
but thats not something you can teach
what seemed so blue in the sunlight
by the night was a pale green

chorus
and i tried to hold her
but it didnt really last long
and shes getting older
i guess shes gotta cut her blue hair off

verse 2
she asked me if she was pretty
well its clear that the girls a fraud
theres really no way of winning
if in their eyes youll always be a dumb blonde
chorus
and she cried over nothing
so there was nothing i could do to stop
her from cutting
her beautiful blue hair off

verse 3
it looked like cotton candy
and just as quick to get licked away
last i heard she was living
with a boy who acts his age

and i guess ill just miss her
even though she isnt even really gone
but things are just different
ever since she cut her blue hair off3embed"
