ive got a job
ive got to move this paper
i guess its all the same to you
but i cant sit around and wait
cant sit around and wait for you
it never works
you say youll call me later
and then you never ever do
i cant sit around and wait
cant sit around and wait for you
just another cup of coffee
ill sit around and wait for you

chorus
i always knew
yeah i always knew
you were a liar
im not a king im not a cop
im not here to punish you
when i really cant see anymore of what the fuss is all about

verse 2
its not my career
to wait and do you favors
i guess its really nothing do
when im running late
you call the undertaker
because youve got so much shit to do
i cant sit around and wait
cant sit around and wait for you
just one more cigarette
ill sit around and wait for you
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus

outro
just another cup of coffee
ill sit around and wait for you
just one more cigarette
ill sit around and wait for you
i guess i really will
ill sit around and wait for youembed"
