i know i know you think im crazy
but dont waste your time
worried bout me baby
im just sleep deprived
it gets so hard
doing all these lines
try to keep up so we can
both lose our minds

chorus
this is that disco shit
that keeps you up all night
makes you want to move
and keeps you on cloud nine
this is that disco shit
that makes you feel alive
it makes you forget
all about the time

verse 2
i hope you dont regret it
cause fun is hard to find
and love is always easy
when drugs are on your mind
nothing is wrong
when you blur the lines
pick a new song i guess that
this will do just fine
you might also likechorus
this is that disco shit
that keeps you up all night
makes you want to move
and keeps you on cloud nine
this is that disco shit
that makes you feel alive
it makes you forget
all about the time
