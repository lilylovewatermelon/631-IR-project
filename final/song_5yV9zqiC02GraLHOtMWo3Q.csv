if you wake to find youre all alone
call me up on the telephone and ill say
come on round kick up your feet
ill check to see if your heart still beats you can stay

i heard her laugh but she sounded blue
i said you know my hearts for you it lies awake
dreaming of its promised land
a gentle touch from your gentle hand i would say

chorus angus  julia stone angus
so hush little darling dont you cry
hush little darling gonna make you mine

verse 2 angus
i know our love did rust away
but through that window came a better day
so dont close the blinds
cause youre my light youre my emptiness
the pretty colors on that summer dress babe

youre all the things that fall from the sky
the sun the rain the moon the light babe
so come on down to this earthly being
and ill hold you close when youre in need babe

so hush little darling dont you cry
hush little darling gonna make you mine

hush little darling dont you cry
so hush little darling gonna make you mineembed"
