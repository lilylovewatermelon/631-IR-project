a coffee stain on a window sill
a bad translation to a foreign film maybe
just walking around with you
walking these towns with you
oh oh oh oh
would be enough

verse 2
the tiny crack on the city stone
a welcome back to your troubled home maybe just
just walking around with you
just walking around with you
oh oh oh oh
would be enough

chorus
ohhhhhh
i didnt see the sea until i crossed
ohhhhhh
i didnt feel her love until i lost

verse 3
the moving shadows on a swaying light
these dusty pillows to hold at night or maybe just
walking around with you
just waking around with you
oh oh oh oh would that be enough
see tom odell liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likeverse 4
the market gifts that fill her drawers yeah
or her little feet on my creaking floors or maybe just
just walking around with you saying
just walking around with you saying
oh oh oh oh it might be enough

chorus
ohhhhhh
i didnt see the sea until i crossed no
ohhhhhh
i didnt feel her love until i lost you know
ohhhhhh
i didnt see the see until i crossed no no
ohhhhhh
i didnt feel her love until i lost
