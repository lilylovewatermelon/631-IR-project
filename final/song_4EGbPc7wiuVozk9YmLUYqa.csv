well on a greyhound bound for shreveport ive been too long in my seat
well i stopped off in a noname town to grab a bite to eat
and the ceiling fans they hummed above a screenedin patio
crawfish hotter than a chimney fire the beer was cheap and cold
and the bar maid smiled that kind of smile that knocked me off my stool
said hang around ill show you things they dont teach in school

verse 2
across the way an old blues man was playin on the street
he moaned just like a black and tan i found myself a seat
he sang lord he lives above us and the devil sleeps beneath
well he growled it mean and low between his three or four gold teeth
and i wished i was in shreveport just agamblin like a fool
well you can learn some things down there they dont teach in school

verse 3
well i dreamed that night of a pretty girl i dreamed of a riverboat
til a man in blue kicked at my shoe said come on boy lets go
i said oh officer oh officer please dont take me to jail
he said you cant sleep outside now my hands are tied i knew that feelin all too well
and if you play in my town son youll play it by the rules
that downtown night shed light on sights that you wont see in school

verse 4
out of jail i found myself awalkin down the road
so glad to hear that old jakebrake come purrin nice and slow
he said im goin as far as fayetteville ive got some room to spare
could you drop me off in fort smith sir ive got family there
and he balled the jack on that big black mack kickin back i played it cool
from a shotgun seat i learned some things that they dont teach in school
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeoutro
and i wished i was in shreveport just agamblin like a fool
well you can learn some things down there they dont teach in school
well i said you can learn some things down there they dont teach in schoolembed"
