its only right if al kapone capone fuck wit a mafia nigga
and when its real yall can tell yall can see it in they eyes
its yo turn see if you can make niggas believe them lies
nigga time
you might also likeround 1 ttop
i said yo
you right bro
when i heard smack made 25 bitch it was one of my worst nights
brizz said top i got my machete im on the first flight
now i know why nu jerzey twork had to go and steal a purse twice
found out what tay roc was makin and not know why he use the word light
beasley said top this is the worlds most respected but this is not the way you earn stripes
i told him nigga ante up befo you find out a purge like
yall see me front page of the paper
some of my niggas still have to serve life
so i could give a fuck about url im tryin to avoid my third strike
nigga you heard right
free my niggas in the halfway house
that mean they half way in but they half way out
i remember cribs we was makin  blaze out
i wanted an ounce but seein how a hand plays out
i make you do it or find out what my stab game bout
i made him turn himself in like his last day out
bitch speakin of last day out you said in january you was goin to prison for a year we was countin too
i guess he got a five minute sentence then got out in two
yall locs really be pullin strings huh well why yall gotta keep us out the loop
it seem like every time a crip go to jail they come straight homeout the blue
first it was the blogs like yo im bout to battle for my life
then his jail sentence went bye faster than my strike
aint that a bitch
for that reason we can never sell bricks with each other
if you cant sit and do ya time nigga we cant even sit with each other
nigga it make sense why him and tsu surf dissin each other
niggas prolly wanna battle so they can snitch on each other
and that aint the type of bullshit that we let slide
if you aint snitchin than let me see ya psi
and ps i aint met a group of solid crips since the gs9
so even though he aint do his time and as funny as it looks
i was the one who offered to put money on ya books
dont forget it
i know this a battle so dont admit it
cause bitch niggas like you worry about ya image
like when he did his gangland show we wanted to see where them pistols at
nigga scrap that at least let us know how they pitchin packs
but geechi bitch ass was the tour guide picture that
i nigga from the mafia turnin into the biggest rat
aye he said this alley right here cuz is where we fuck the bitches at
right here by the  is where we do our crippin at
last week at the dice game we blew a niggas biscuit back
snitchin ass you let em mic you up like the shit was smack
then you had them niggas behind you like cuz spittin facts
shit was sad if we was the nuttys we wouldve whipped ya ass and took ya flag
thats how i know he was a decoy walkin
cause if he was really puttin in work
they wouldve had his face blacked out with the deep voice talkin
weve seen those often it wouldve went like yo this bae loc i was the man in 09
big trapper everything from grams to whole pies
my bundles came with a stamp on both sides
but they showed ya face cause you was talkin bout hair the whole time
bro you really sell hair weave bro
aight i guess its all a grind
but tryin to take yo talent to prison boy you done lost yo mind
he said listen up everybody i aint gon take up all ya time
but you can get the pusha ts the iversons i do all designs
a nigga yelled out from his cell i like stars in mine
he said come fall in line you know we do those all the time
and thats the reason gotti shouldnt be glorified
he a bitch i seen more man in his daughter eyes
you saw them guys what he starin at son
he was yellin criiiiip until some damage get done
my man backed out i said hand me that gun
next time he throw a sign up in his whip it gon be a handicap one
i will handicap son this as real as it get
expose him kissin a pop like gilly da kid
i hope i get the same thing they gave bill for the shit
why
cause i can do a 3 to 10 just for peelin pillin a bitch
im really convinced
when we found out twork was fuckin coffee brown in vegas you were salty
i mean you aint say no hatin shit but ya face did all the talkin
twork said soon as he fell asleep that bitch ate it on a softy
i said nigga we watched dna fold ya folgers
he said yeah the best part was wakin up to coffee
the best part of waking up is coffee in yo cup
aye im just shakin up his coffin to make sure he dont sleep right
i break his hand to pieces the nigga cant even peace right
chopper on me geechi gotti better learn to weave right
or his head tapped like he aint do a bitch weave right
concrete nigga
round 2 geechi gotti
you gonna talk some gang shit to me like you really ridin or somethin
geechi shouldve blurred his face out only niggas doin that must be hidin from somethin
he said i need to have home games to win
stop it clown until smack throw an event in my hood all my battles is out of town
im from compton i dont feel comfortable unless the glock around
cause the same niggas thatll lift you up will turn around an knock you down
lets get down to the truth
cause the moment you joined nwx brizz joined cave gang and you was mad about that
so pretendin that you not is what we not gon do
you and cuz came in together you was like damn brizz
you was mad why he could not go witchu
it instantly reminded you of the relationship witcha mother
cause now another person that you love chose rock over you
you a fuck boy top let the truth be told
any nigga thatll sell is moms a rock will prolly sell his soul
you not even a drug dealer you just a nigga that dealt drugs befo
had a couple of double ups prolly graduated to an ounce but nothin mo
so all that king pen shit in ya raps you just stuntin wit that
you aint had no boats bricks bundles of crack
enough wit the cap cause you aint seen no real money til you start fuckin wit smack
nigga smack made you but you ungrateful
so they pay me to kill the bear
up here talkin all this shit thats why i dont feel the bear
cause if it wasnt for them niggas cub wouldnt be shit
be basically showed us how to buildabear
they gave you the platform to build ya brand but you ungrateful
up here actin like niggas need me
smack thats exactly why you shouldnt have fed the bear them bitches greedy
you was up there on angryfan soundin straight soft
followin hitman when every time he got booked it was big plates
that nigga ate off adolf
can you not see nazi yall in different tax brackets
thats not the nigga you should talk through
he gassed you up you aint even realize all the bread you was gonna let holla cost holocaust you
i should off you but i know you niggas they hoe you niggas
got you signed to them slave deals
worried about that 25 get that shit out ya mind
cause unless smack take ya bitch ass to dinner you aint gettin a paid meal
i stay real now right about now i feel like spittin on you
cause you started to strike for these niggas now its time to get ya casket see which one of them will pick it picket for you
nigga you been disloyal i could never shit on url
they done did mo fo me than any of these leagues since a nigga been rappin
especially you you low key one of the bummiest battle rappers
so befo this little bit of money i can only imagine
he literally made you from the dirt like god did adam
even if you dont believe this yo daddy we do
thats some shit we dont gotta go to maury for
how come you always opening ya mouth sayin some shit then you gotta turn around and say sorry for
you know why cause he disrespected kenneka
they made ya bitch ass apologize
then you disrespected url niggas made ya bitch ass apologize
but he want yall to believe that nigga was sellin dope to the fiends
late night he had to stand on the curb
nigga please you cant even stand on ya word
word up
anything i say i can stand on it
i learned from a kid you gotta stay down
i found out every bird dont fly once i took the work on a greyhound
you niggas is straight clown fake beefin
i should call you niggas actors
make sure it was sealed tight enough so a dog couldnt smell it
my only issue with a wrapper
you not a factor
ever since 12 years old ive been gang bangin
im thankin god i aint gotta spend my life in prison
you arguin with smack and beasley tryin to make a deal
nigga in court we had to take a deal
strikes is different
nigga our lives is different

round 2 ttop
bro you really gonna bring up kenneka again king
damn i thought you was a friend
but i said the line in yo hood bitch and you aint do nothin then
now i realize why your slogan is yous a bitch
cause your whole side hustle is based on how you use a bitch
yo wifey had dreams of doin hair nigga she prolly went to school and shit
then you took over the empire like lucious did
soon as that pack touched down he said ooh thats it
these lace fronts can blend in with the roots and shit
oh thats too legit i know some bitches that could use the shit
a crab in a bucket huh thats gotta be one of the truest myths
cause she always knew somethin pussy would stop her from makin it baby she just aint realize you the risk
who is this i dont care if he nutty blocc or hoover crip
grape street rolling or one of these lil newer crips
ill tool his shit have him tryin to make it to the dispatch
he know when top roll up on him it aint a zig zag get a half moon or a stick
i dont care which witch craft
a revolver hit him square in the stomach he get the six pack quick fast
i spit on yo crip rag ya bitch ass
give him five out the old eagle the mcnabb
two options we can lock a locker room like its gym glass
or yall can get ya hero rock like the jim class
aye bay bay he never sayin shit
beretta hangin from his head like he hurricane chris
dawg you really a lil nigga i can keep in the shadows
i done went viral more times than you even battled
you here now but that dont mean we eager to have you
we just know if we wanted to get stoned in the west than we needed a statue
theres mad proof we seen ya bandannas and tattoos
thought about the west coast image said thats you so smack drew
up a contract it was that smooth
ya stats grew til the day that you get ya ass chewed
aye cause chico gon whisper to beas ya man trash dude
beasley told chico nigga this was smack move
well congratulations this ya graduation come get ya cap blew
they told me peel gotti since i already capped tsu capsule
and then you let the christian nigga beat you i watched them bring god into the streets
sammy the bull that white boy took gotti off the streets
rain vegan now i told him i aint knockin what you eat
long as its bout chicken you still got me when its beef
do you copy or capiche you fake italian weights will bound him
take him to the lake and drown him
record the murder so we can make tapes and clown him
show the six god so they dont want drake around him
he got plates around him but he aint never turn a half to a fo
or trapped on the road you from cali you aint never moved a pack through the snow
i had glass on the stove and bags on the go
sudafed commercial come get a blast for ya nose
nigga im the original trap hustler
four days straight now thats hunger
we found a snake in la the black mamba
i came here to catch me a body cause smack love ya
and i owe it all to yo gotti im blac youngsta
aye some facts for ya before they start callin for time
whoever told you you could beat me all of em lied
they got you thinkin you a star bitch its all in ya mind
any views you get from this battle all of em mine
but listen ima let you have a million
before this you never had a million
barely a half a million
you just been here blendin in like you halfchameleon
he aint never put packs in the ceilin
if you did then im snatchin ya children
like aye bae loc i need half of a million and bring my bitch at least 40 packs of brazilian
concrete

round 3 geechi gotti
you said i lost to the christian
crowd starts yelling facts
i took it light on a ward i couldve gave that christian major pain
i grew up in the ghetto watchin fiends shoot up like lord i guess they was usin gods name in vain vein
you the lamest lame
talkin bout you be cookin crack you aint even got a car
but you want us to believe you whippin
we got rocks the size of baseballs
them crackheads will tell you how we was pitchin
hard white nigga the best dope came back yellow like the simpsons
this nigga trippin
what block you get doe on
i did my research
that same block you cant go on
i know ya type in the hood you big mike in the wood
you aint nowhere near a rider
got him backin up from the ratchet
oh this is how we do it in north carolina
im the street supplier
i get the work off pedro and them the crack spanish
got fiends passin out from the dope my trap savage
i done literally seen somethin drop every other day this smack madness
the strap plastic
face shot leave a nigga mouth wide
i remember bein outside shootin
goin in the house my mama be like son be careful somebody was just shootin outside
on the outside lookin in you cant fall in love with this shit
homie its temporary
niggas dont know each other on a first name basis we know each other by our hood names
half the time we dont find out ya government until its on the obituary
this shit is scary cause soon as ya bag up thats when the hate rise i done took lives
so i know theres a nigga out there tryin to take mine
thats why i keep one eye focused and the other lookin over my shoulders bitch im snake eyez
you aint never live like this you dont know what i had to witness growin up
only thing scarier than bein chased by that shooter bein on trial and the witness showin up
nigga im from the gangland you better watch what type of shit you throwin up
cause this right here can have the wrong words bein said
our sign language can show you the difference from bein deaf and bein bad
they say i dont got enough bars from movie quotes and shit from reality tv
thats why the fans be mad at me
i say i dont give a fuck these niggas makin movies and tv shows on my reality
dont be a casualty to the war on the streets
cause bein fresh to death got a whole new meanin when they bury you with what you wore on the streets
boy im a beast and you must be crazy
cause if ya fat ass too lazy to run when i shoot you gon end up a lost soul
you better wish i miss you like uncle charles or they gon have to meet you at the crossroad
im in boss mode side shot feel like a kidney stone
they cant even see the flesh only thing left was bizzy bone
what is we sayin no harmin me harmony
im forever strapped its no harmin me aint no harmin me
ask around i done put in that good work
you make the wrong move tonight and yall will see tee bein stretched like one of suge shirts
nigga my hood cursed i rap what i know
this aint no madeup shit that i imagined
i literally seen him put 15 holes in a nigga that was 15 so many holes they couldnt patch it
lil nigga didnt even have no pussy befo he died a virgin
first time gettin in some box it was a casket
this shit tragic
you prolly aint never seen what i seen
im closerange seen him get hit in the head
his family was low on money
had to do a gofundme to come up with the bread
so they had that funeral til like a month and a half later
shit most of us had forgot he was dead
nigga you heard what i said
its crazy how niggas celebrate death
them funerals look like a festival
ttop get a head shot til he brain dead
but ima keep shootin cause mama always told me to finish my vegetables
nigga im 
nigga when i went to jail i stayed silent i never ratted on a soul
nigga ask my bitch even after she wash i dont never fold
straight up i really live this crippin
my niggas put the gang over everythang
they fuck around and put the shelf under the hood like the engine trippin
yeah i wasnt always rappin bitch i was loccin
i did time at 16 for the beef i aint jokin
my mama came up like son why was you shootin
shit i was open
and you was hopin i dont tell these niggas how you was callin my phone when you was in my city cause you was really scared
dont worry cuz i dont do personals id rather use a gun shot to kill him instead
they say look you cant find no dirt on t
aw gotti this finna be a classic
nah yall just aint found no dirt on top cause i aint lowered his casket
and when its real yall can tell yall can see it in they eyes
go head its yo turn see if they can believe them lies
nigga time

round 3 ttop
said url this my closing verse
like fuck a casket throw this bastard in the back and just close the hearse
i aint come here to make the crowd go berserk
i came here just to show yall work
now let me put it in
dawg we tired of hearin bout ya gun crimes
i mean if nitty the king you gotta be the gun line prince
the reason i dont do that back to back punchline shit
is cause ya whole round seem wack soon as one line miss
i dump my bricks i done moved weight in the buildin
you walk in smell like you paintin the buildin
but i dont move weight in the buildin
next month its like we repaintin the building
i aint never heard of geechi movin shakin the buildin
thats why when it come to believing in you its just hard to do it
i mean we done watched crips go from cookin crack to cookin up with martha stewart
and harvard students we still got to move with the cartridge shootin
you trip get everything i got its all inclusive
dont ask about ttop or if hes sparkin rugers
cause hell hair go right at ya head like cardi do it
but let me guess its crip nation we are the movement
aint nobody gangbang til we had the heart to do it
well what about them new york black spades that was down wit the hunger gang
them old school vice lords who we know wasnt fuckin playin
yall sayin gang bangin started in the west well thats just excludin all the other gangs
yall bitchass niggas was just the first ones to colorbang
another thang
yall supposed to build wit each other even the kids
yall supposed to give em skills to recover
but yall the first black gang to start killin each other
pop ya homie hit the funeral and chill wit his mother
yall niggas suckas
the shit that he wont even admit
like if crips wasnt so fuckin disloyal nigga bloods wouldnt even exist
lets keep it crip
im tellin yall its not what it seems
sorry west coast but cuz sold compton a dream
i just call em crips they dont know what mafia mean
thats east coast shit plus the real gotti from queens
see thats the shit that be havin me so lost
a west coast mafia crip who go and take the name of an east coast boss
hes so soft
but i can tell you why they lettin geechi rock out
cause nutty blocc aint had a poppin rapper on the set since bg knoccout
bitch and you let em call you baybay loc
aight i see you took this all the way
i bet you wish you could change yo name and wash it all away
i be confused witcha niggas aint tryin to call ya gay
but its a man on the phone every time that niggas callin bay
thats all im sayin i aint playin
i came to hurt guys
jakkboys and rydas my goonies aint none of twork guys
i dont just hit em wit the car i reverse mine
and shoot bae down wit the tips im the worst kind
the next thing you know your family up in the church line
mama cryin callin ya homie like whats ya shirt size
thats what gon happen you try to run up wit my work slime
caught a hurt shine

we gon make it rain in southern california for the first time
why cause i keep the ratchet cross the hall like shenaynay crib
