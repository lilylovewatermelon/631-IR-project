out of place out of space and time wide awake
out of papers i am not okay
i am out my mind
outer space that’s where i been goin
to a place where place where nobody knows
floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don’t

hook
i do not feel the fear of fallin i wanna fly
if it all goes well then i will
but what if i don’t

bridge
ill be right where i was before
but i’m not alone you say take my hand
and we go and we go and we go and we go
and i hope that we don’t overdose
cause we don’t cause we don’t
no we don’t no we dont
ever know when we have had enough

wait

verse 2
now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
i am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
broken promise of everything that i thought you were
thought you said this would never hurt that’s what it did that is all
you might also likehook
i do not feel the fear of falling
thought i could fly
it didn’t go well but oh well
what do you know

bridge
i’m right back where i was before
but i’m not alone you say take my hand
and we go and we go and we go and we go
and i hope that we don’t overdose
cause we don’t cause we don’t
no we don’t no we dont
ever know when we have had enough
im a be so cold need some more
i’ve never felt these things before
i’m a feind for sure please dont go
how could you not need me no more

youre the only thing that i love
you’re the only thing that i want
you’re the only reason the only reason

i do not feel the fear of fallin i wanna fly
if it all goes well then i will
but what if i don’t
ill be right where i was before
but i’m not alone
youre all that i know98embed"
