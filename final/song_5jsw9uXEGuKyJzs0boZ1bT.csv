verse 1
i thought that id been hurt before
but no ones ever left me quite this sore
your words cut deeper than a knife
now i need someone to breathe me back to life

prechorus
got a feeling that im goin under
but i know that ill make it out alive
if i quit calling you my lover
move on

chorus
you watch me bleed until i cant breathe shaking
falling onto my knees
and now that im without your kisses
ill be needin stitches
trippin over myself aching
begging you to come help
and now that im without your kisses
ill be needin stitches

verse 2
just like a moth drawn to a flame
oh you lured me in i couldnt sense the pain
your bitter heart cold to the touch
now im gonna reap what i sow
im left seein red on my own
