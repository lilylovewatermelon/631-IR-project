well what have you been doing in my dreams
its turning out to be a living nightmare when i sleep
but ive got the upper hand
cause i was gone before she ever really knew i left
this bar stools my escape from things that i dont want to see
and if they rear their ugly heads im up and leaving

chorus
think im gonna irish goodbye
cause i dont have the time to tell you so long
cause its just best that i go home
i aint trying to start a fight or ruin anyones time
leave like a drunk ghost in the night
with another irish goodbyе

verse
do you think theyll care if i go home
im surе ill get some shit from them tomorrow i suppose

and she just reared her ugly head so im up and leaving

chorus
think im gonna irish goodbye
cause i dont have the time to tell you so long
cause its just best that i go home
