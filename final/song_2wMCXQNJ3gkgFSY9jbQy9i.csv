andré 3000

bridge andré 3000
full length mirrors and her hair in a bun
kids with big glasses that laugh when they run
girls with old school names like ruby mae
or how infants with baby breath yawn in your face
or getting tucked in every night for a month
by all of the american apparel ad girls
american american apparel ad ad girls
you know what i mean

interlude
i like it when youre under the ocean and all you can feel is calm
i like it when im sleeping
i like it when im listening to music because thats the only thing that takes me to another world another world
i like it when public bathrooms have scented candles
i like it when you talk to me like that
i like it when my hair is fluffy
i like it when it rains at night and im curled up in bed with a good book
i like it when i turn my head around and i catch you looking back

chorus
you know it when you see it
you know it when its there
like michael jackson thriller
like farrah fawcett hair
its good shit i like it when you play with my hair
its good shit i like it when you play with my hair
its good shit i like it when you play with my hair
oh yeah i like it when you play with my hair
you know it when you see it
you know it when its there
like michael jackson thriller
like farrah fawcett hair
its good shit
its good shit
oh its good shit baby
its good shit
oh yeah
