were not so different you and me
cause we both share our share of obscenities
and everybodys got some freaky tendencies
hidden or admitted cause we all got needs

and i make no apologies ah ah im into phonography ah ah
and i like my bluetooth buttons coming loose loose
i need my hands free ah ah
then i let my mind roam ah ah playing with my ringtone

make believe youre next to me
