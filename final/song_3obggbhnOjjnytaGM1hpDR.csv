give us this day our daily dose of faux affliction
forgive our sins forged at the pulpit
with forked tongues selling faux sermons
because i am a newwave gospel sharp and youll be thy witness
so gentlemen if youre gonna preach
for god sakes preach with conviction

just stay where i can see you douse the lights
we sure are in for a show tonight

verse 2

weve got the gunslinger extraordinaire a walking contradiction
and i for one can see no blood
from the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit
and i for one wont stand for this
if this scene were a parish youd all be condemned
