i put the same pedal down on the same metal slung
the same gravel goodbye high
i burned the same bridges up with the same finger up
she got out the drivers side

prechorus
so i know what never comin back looks like
looks like she aint ever comin back

chorus
it’s usually me doing the leaving me doing the running
i dont know where shes going
but i know a little something bout
smokin up them goodyears
to know that it aint lookin good here for thе home crowd
guess she bеat me at my own game
thing about a twolane guess its gotta work both ways
what goes around comes around came around and here i am now
on this side of a dust cloud

verse 2
shes burnin unleaded and my own medicine
tastes more bitter than sweet
her tires are turnin and the tables are too
never seen a broken heart from this point of view

it’s usually me doing the leaving me doing the running
i dont know where shes going
but i know a little something bout
smokin up them goodyears
to know that it aint lookin good here for the home crowd
guess she beat me at my own game
thing about a twolane guess its gotta work both ways
what goes around comes around came around and here i am now
on this side of a dust cloud

bridge
so i know what never comin back looks like

smokin up them goodyears
to know that it aint lookin good here for the home crowd
