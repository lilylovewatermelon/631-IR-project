her eyelids felt heavy and pained her when she opened and closed them she’d slept four hours between shifts

“call her will ya” her editor said as he flipped through the unorganized piles of newspaper and timecards on his desk

“we need an updated photo for tomorrow’s issue it’s going a1”

anna imagined if this were 1950 her editor would have extinguished the cigarette pinched between his fingers at this point in the conversation instead he took a quick gulp from an energy drink can

anna wasn’t prepared to argue with the editor she’d only had for a few months leaving her with two options feel like a human being or… well… not one

anna’s knuckles were turning white as she clenched the back of one of her editor’s office chairs when she relinquished the polyester material she was surprised by the amount of sweat her palms left behind

there hadn’t been a fatal case of plague in this county for over three decades anna was under the impression the plague only affected rats aboard ships and middle agesera europeans there were fewer than 50 nationwide cases in the entire decade and here anna was contemplating calling a mother whose daughter played concert cello hours before dying from the plague three days ago

it was mother’s day

the photo sent along in the press release promised the story a lot of page views a blond haired beauty with dark green eyes and an endearing set of freckles tessa haven looked like the ideal babysitter anna dreamed of as a kid anna wondered if she was a lifeguard to a young anna there was nothing better than being a lifeguard

anna’s editor wanted a photo of the dead girl’s mother or at least he wanted to say they’d tried to get a photo of the dead girl’s mother anna cringed at the thought she imagined the once wellknown olympic swimmer answer the phone with a quivering “yes”

anna would bet her entrylevel journalist’s salary betty haven let one postman after another hand her an arrangement of flowers today she was the mother who lost her only daughter on mother’s day

anna’s fingers hovered over her desk phone’s keys
had someone asked her yesterday if she’d ever call a grieving mother on mother’s day to ask for a photo she would have answered surely

no way

it can wait

was the public curious about how betty haven felt yes but was it worth disturbing a distressed woman in the first few days of being daughterless on a day that celebrated her motherhood

no way no how

yet her fingers still hovered above the illuminated phone keys the dial tone became white noise

journalism was supposed to be easier than this anna thought as long as she cared about the community cared about justice cared about telling the truth everything would work out just fine she was told by her tenured professors

did those tenured professors never have to call a dead girl’s mother on mother’s day

anna typed in three of the keys before her editor yelled across the room

“anna never mind we have bigger fish to fry”

anna exhaled but was soon disturbed by this revelation bigger fish to fry what could have happened in the last few minutes

“we’ve got a serial shooter” her editor said peering over her cubicle wall

“like a sniper” anna asked
her editor didn’t answer he was already talking about the serial shooter’s first victim an eighteenyearold was found lying on the sidewalk with a bullet wound to the chest

this was the second of two shootings in the area the first left a woman with a hole in her shoulder but alive to tell the tale she hadn’t seen a thing she was driving when her window shattered she thought the pain was from the broken glass

there was a vigil planned for victim one that night

“do whatever you have to do to cover this thing” her editor said as he walked toward the vending machine

the other photographer was on vacation anna could work a split shift she didn’t mind taking a long lunch the tavern has twoforone burgers today the cook knew to package one up for anna to take home and eat later and she needed to change her shirt to something more vigil appropriate

anna met the reporter at the college green space listed on the press release it said there were enough candles for 200 but the grass was covered in what anna guessed was easily 500 people the vigil didn’t start for fifteen minutes

“it’s not everyday i get pulled off a story about a teen death for another” the reporter said poppy a name that did not suit her frosty nature scanned the crowd for tears she’d moved here from a larger paper she’d covered a hundred of these events

anna could count on her hands how many vigils she’d covered

“did i tell you what i was doing…”

mid sentence anna noticed the men embracing they sat on the curb the older mans arm around the younger the younger man maybe even a boy buried his head into his knees he was sobbing

annas feelings about photographing vigils were lovehate to say the least she felt like a vulture stalking the helpless

after seeing the men hugging she dropped to one knee placing the camera in front of her eye she was buried in the crowd they couldnt see her good the vulture is hidden in the weeds

through the viewfinder anna liked what she saw the older mans profile was nice he wore a cowboy hat cowboy hats make good pictures
after a few clicks anna had her photos and they were front page worthy now she had to get their names this was the hard part she imagined herself walking up and saying hey there i know this is a real tough time for yall and everything but can i get your names it made her shudder inserting herself in other peoples worst moments was always uncomfortable always intrusive always tough to do

to think she could be knocking on betty haven’s door at the moment inserting herself into betty’s tragedy anna wasn’t sure which was worse

thats tylers uncle and cousin a woman said next to anna

annas throat tightened a tear perched itself on her bottom eyelid god this shit never got easier

“this communitys been through a lot anna managed to say her throat tightened more

she was unsure whether it was professional to cry a family in the same community lost a toddler a few months before drowned her father was nearly within earshot

anna wanted to call it our community but she couldnt she’d only been here five months it was too soon

a vulture she remained

these were the times anna wished she were a portrait photographer she could have a shop on her hometown’s main street where bricks still constructed the road she could have mismatched furniture from local thrift stores where her clients could sit and choose their senior photo package

“package a really makes the most sense” anna could imagine herself saying to a soontobe senior high school quarterback “you need pocket size prints for all those friends of yours”

if she were her own boss she wouldn’t have to wait for mourners to hug she wouldn’t open the newspaper the morning after covering a vigil in hopes of seeing two men crying on the front as long as her byline was underneath it

but she did

anna snatched the paper off her apartment stoop’s welcome rug she didn’t even need to slide it out of the blue plastic bag to see it there her photo was a1 in color anna felt proud but quickly itched at her collar sure she felt feathers

she flipped through the other pages there was a vacant store for rent featured in the classifieds about the perfect size for a studio anna thought while drinking coffee she’d brewed using the same grounds from yesterday

her phone rang and she shuddered no one seemed to call her except to tell her there was breaking news or they needed jumper cables

“the boy’s parents are not happy about the vigil story” her editor said without a greeting “said they got too many people asking about their son being in a gang”

anna put her face in her hands

“but” her editor said

he paused anna knew her editor tried to get a rise out of people she had no doubt that was underway

“but” he said again “you’ve got a four o’clock with betty she wants to talk a shooter story is definitely going a1 but if you can get something good we could use filler in the local section all the reporters are tied up so this is all you”

just like that betty haven went from frontpage story material to “filler” serial shooters get all the glory

anna immediately looked to her closet she’d wore her i’msorryyourchilddied shirt last night and it sat in the hamper with her cigarette smoke soaked jackets

at least mother’s day expired nine hours ago

anna decided on a plum collared article she last endured at her great grandparents’ 90th anniversary party anna wondered if it would still fit she didn’t have feathers to hide then

betty haven’s front porch seemed welcoming from anna’s car parked down the street

her phone buzzed in her pocket

“don’t fuck it up” the text read

her editor could be so encouraging

anna closed her eyes and let her mind retreat into a calmer place her mind usually took her back to timber creek her parents still lived in the home they built when her mother was pregnant with her images of her rural nebraska upbringing entered her mind pink cowboy boots garth brooks concert tshirts learning how to boot scootin’ boogie

only a few acres of land separated annas house from her grandparents the gravel road that ran between was contoured to prairie creek when anna traveled the eight hours to visit she would walk the distance between the two houses counting the rows of soybeans and corn the number hardly changed year to year

on her last visit she couldnt stop herself from sitting on the edge of the ditch and weeping on her walk when a neighbor drove by and waved she’d got up and wiped the tears ignoring the dirt under her fingers nails and waved back

she knew her mother would be waiting for her sitting on the front porch watching the traffic on the highway wondering why jolene was heading into town at nine in the morning for the third time this week she would have a diet mountain dew in her hand and her hair would still be wet from showering looking cockatoolike she would be sitting in her robe inviting anna to sit next to her and watch the cars she was sure aunt sherry would be driving by soon in her new jeep

her mother always spoke she never asked anna questions about her new life her new job anna didnt mind so much anymore though it used to bother her greatly it allowed anna to further escape the uneasiness she felt about her new career her mother would go on for an entire episode of antiques roadshow about whos cheating who and whos quit their boss lately

when anna loaded up her 4runner and headed back to her empty apartment filled with unfamiliar smells she looked in her rearview mirror for much too long the silos filled with corn that helped pay her student loans reflected the morning light her two labradors one golden and one black ran in the yard minding the electric fence keeping them from wandering into the highway

there was no electric fence keeping anna back she shouldn’t want to stay she had a degree and dreams of a career that would be chronicled “all the president’s men” style anna wondered which actress would get the esteemed role of playing her

but when teenagers died in timber creek anna wasn’t a vulture anna was expected to grieve with others not to take a pulitzer prize winning photograph

she wouldn’t wonder whether she felt human

that photo studio on main street sounded more appealing with every community tragedy she covered every paycheck that hardly covered the rent her mother could manage the finances and her brother who’d married rich always wanted to invest in his younger sister

she knew her kitchen table would be piled high with bills no doubt there would be more in the mailbox her parents’ mailbox only had timber creek’s newsletter and possibly a graduation announcement from the neighbor boy next door

the same town that was proudly home to the largest ice cream cone in the state sheltered anna from the world the town’s residents despised the current president no matter what party he belonged to too uninformed to be partisan serial shooters belonged to fiction plots it was a convenient upbringing charmed and filled with people telling anna to “count your blessings” it was not the type of upbringing that prepares you for the cruel world and definitely not to report on its mothers whose children died too young

the havens’ house seemed outdated like a victorian woman decorated it in 1890 and the havens didn’t want to disturb her hard work

“we’ll sit in the parlor” betty said

the parlor maybe betty was somehow the victorian woman anna thought

betty’s greeting was warm she could pass as person who hadn’t just lost a child anna thought her hair was done her makeup looked like she’d run out to dillard’s to have the ladies at gold sales counters apply it before buying a jar of night cream

anna kept reminding herself betty had called her betty wanted her to be here anna wasn’t intruding the image of the vulture entered her head and anna’s collar suddenly felt tight she checked for more feathers

the walls were covered with photos celebrating tessa’s accomplishments volleyball debate track anna checked it didn’t look like she’d been a lifeguard betty was with her daughter every step of the way donned in coaching gear betty smiled and wore the same medal as her daughter and her teammates

betty looked to the large black canon cameras resting on both of anna’s hips

“are you a photographer too” betty said

she smoothed her tweed pencil shirt as the tips of her heels tapped the hardwood floors anna suddenly felt underdressed

“i’m primarily a photographer actually”

“they didn’t care to send a real reporter” betty said as she placed her long fingers on the sharp outline of her hips

anna didn’t remember having time to react but she must have betty closed her eyes and pressed her lips together

“i apologize but you have to understand this is important to me i’ve nowhere else to turn”

there weren’t people like betty in timber creek she was intimidating and brutally honest she spoke slowly and with a sense of dignity anna wished she had betty was commanding and seemed to posses a quality that could hold even a goon’s attention anna was petrified unsure she was equipped to handle this situation

“i understand” anna said even though she didn’t

betty inhaled the stuffy air filling the room and sat on a couch with a dusty pink slip cover the tall slender woman anna guessed could still give olympic swimmers a run for their money slumped into the seat tilting her face toward the ceiling

“i need help” betty said

anna’s heart skipped helping was the reason she majored in journalism unsure how she could do much good as an interior designer if a journalist doesn’t help they can say goodbye to the new katherine hepburn vying for a role in their biopic

“i’ve started a scholarship fund in tessa’s name” betty said

she leaned forward and placed her face in her hands

“it hasn’t raised a single cent”

she looked up at anna

“i thought you could write a story it can run on the front page just like your photo from that boy’s vigil that would get the exposure it needs to revive the fund”

she paused and closed her eyes

“i can’t stand the thought of my daughter’s memory fading this quickly because a senseless shooter stole the community’s attention”

anna knew nobody wanted to read about a scholarship fund unless a scholarship fund helped find the serial shooter on the loose anna knew it wouldn’t make the paper maybe around christmas it would if it were a really slow news day people would read a short story about betty’s first few days after the loss of her daughter but even that couldn’t be more than a couple hundred words for the “filler” her editor requested

“unfortunately i can’t promise you what the story will be about” anna said while looking down at her shoes

betty titled her head

“well what else will it be about”

betty wanted to strike a deal the image of a page explaining ethics from anna’s mass media and society class entered her mind

“i don’t know that now” anna said “why don’t you tell me about your daughter what would you want the world to know about her”

betty shifted her large green eyes to the window her furrowed brow allowed wrinkles to show her age sixty one according to a brief google search

anna could tell betty realized her story didn’t stand a chance against public safety there was an active threat in the community and no suspects in a town this size people would be satisfied to open their paper and see a cover story about the shooter for weeks on end and her editor would keep running them knowing this type of manhunt paid his salary

“i want people to know the best way to serve my daughter’s memory is to donate to her scholarship fund” betty said “a scholarship fund that will help a cellist go to julliard like my daughter might have”

anna left only with quotes referring to the fund

“what would you like to tell someone going through something similar” anna asked

“to donate to a scholarship fund”

“would you suggest volunteering or finding a way to help parents who’ve lost children”

“scholarships help parents”

when anna felt defeated enough to excuse herself from the parlor betty asked if she was sure she wanted to leave unsure how to respond anna smiled slightly

there were going to be more bettys anna thought there were going to be more people that would make her feel uncomfortable unsure of herself as a journalist she wondered if betty would have made other journalists squirm in their chair or if anna was weaker than she thought maybe anna belonged in timber creek where people didn’t challenge her where things came easy

“i hope you hear from me again” betty said as she closed the door behind her

anna wondered if she heard her right

anna took a photo of betty before leaving she didn’t have the heart to ask the woman to part with the couch she’d nestled herself into

as she walked the block to her car she noticed her pace was slow for being on deadline she would rather sit through geology 101 again than piece the last hour into a story that might not even publish

her editor sent her another message

“everyone’s dropping their stories need whatever you got asap”

anna stopped and exhaled betty would get her way a story about her scholarship would have to run maybe it would be next to the obnoxious interstate furniture store ad buried alongside the community calendar but it would run

a small victory

now anna thought people have to read it

with the morning paper in hand a few people stopped by anna’s cubicle peaked over the edge and complimented her work in passing

“i wish you’d used more quotes but you made something outta nothing” someone said with ambiguous approval she knew no actresses would be fighting over the role of playing her for making something out of nothing

anna imagined herself walking into her editor’s office he’d quip about her story’s quotes she wouldn’t laugh nervously like she usually did unsure if he was serious or not she’d toss a piece of paper with her signature scribbled at the bottom across his desk before he could ask her why she was quitting she’d be on her way to timber creek wondering where she would take her first group of seniors for their portrait shoots

the police scanner’s afternoon traffic chatter changed suddenly to an ominous tone

“code 3 attempted 839 at west beacon and dodge”

anna stood up reaching for her camera

it could be the shooter

the scanner squelched on a man was running on a trail outside of town when he heard a gunshot a bullet lodged in a tree ten feet to his left

anna’s editor peaked around the corner of his office door

“you’re up anna”

the nearvictim must have chosen the hardest trail in the county to find anna wished she’d grown wings by now

map sprawled across the front seat google maps open anna found relief that if she crashed she wouldn’t add to the community’s teen death count at 22 years old

as anna drove out of town her pocket vibrated

what could it be now did a teen come down with a case of leprosy had black death made an appearance in the county

the i80 interchange was a few miles away with a slight left she could be on her way to timber creek she put the phone to her ear ready to tell her editor to find a new vulture

“we’ve got ted bingham on the phone says he want’s betty haven’s number” her editor said it sounded like he was chewing gum

ted bingham owned nearly every movie theater in the region and half the beef packing plants

in the few months she’d worked in this town she’d learned little about ted bingham but she knew he gave more money to charities than she’d hoped to make in five lifetimes

she smiled thinking of betty anna wondered if the fund overflowing with money would accomplish the healing betty pined for she frowned doubting it would

“ya better call betty and do a follow up” he said “she better agree to it she really owes you one here”

this would make a great story for her students when she was tenured at western kentucky anna thought she’d tell it to all the seniors in their last semester before they’d all graduate with ambitions to become the next ansel adams or dorthea lange

meryl streep anna thought that’s who should play her in the movie

she passed the 180 interchange and the images of the studio on main street faded from view

her editor’s voice returned

“and false alarm on the shooting turns out a yahoo with bad aim shot at a vulture in his yard”embed"
