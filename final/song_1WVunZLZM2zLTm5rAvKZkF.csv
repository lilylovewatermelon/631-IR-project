you only pass through my city
every once in a million seconds on a broken clock
yet we talk like were living
only miles only minutes from another just around the block
as i stare at my screen shining blue and green
all alone in a coffee shop
i cant help but imagine what maybe couldve happened
if you werent just an online love

outro
sometimes i say hi and he like doesnt answer
maybe okay maybe hes just in a bad mood
i think hes just i think hes just going through something
