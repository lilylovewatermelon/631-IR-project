stealing whats been stolen
and whats given man i dont get for free
couldnt find a reason but put the blame on me
takin water while the well is dry
and the devils always smilin when you pass by

drifting on my shattered piece of sorry stubbornness
one more mistake but i really need that risk
ive noticed roots and the rhythm remain
but they never like they seem
and now the stories lost its theme

chorus
right back where i first started from
theyll all listen when i play this rythem
break it off when its given to me
dont worry if its over im just waitin patiently before i
pick up the lovin that hold me down
them no try and come after me in this underground
whom god blessed let no man curse
the first will be the last and the last will be the first

verse
so i sloped into the room
playin my guitar in my worn out shoes
i want to hear the sound just like a stage show no
where they all lose control
and it never lets you go
you might also likechorus
right back where you first started from
theyll all listen when i play this rythem
break it off when its given to me
dont worry if its over im just waitin patiently before i
pick up the lovin that hold me down
them no try and come after me in this underground
whom god blessed let no man curse
the first will be the last and the last will be the first
right back where you first started from
theyll all listen when i play this rythem
break it off when its given to me
dont worry if its over im just waitin patiently before i
pick up the lovin that hold me down
them no try and come after me in this underground
whom god blessed let no man curse
the first will be the last and the last will be the first

outro
the first will be the last and the last will be the first
the first will be the last and the last will be the first
the first will be the last and the last will be the first no
the first will be the last and the last will be the first
the first will be the last and the last will be the first who is cursed
the first will be the last and the last will be the first tell me who is cursed
the first will be the last and the last will be the first who is cursed
the first will be the last and the last will be the firstembed"
