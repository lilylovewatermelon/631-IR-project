memphis comes creeping down my back
somehow this place tastes just like an attack
a hundredyardstare of a kiss
lord i know ill never miss it
they told me stop scouting the field
they told me have a look in commercial appeal
and start getting that hair cut sharp

chorus
sometimes i think that ill find a love
one thats gonna change my heart
ill find it in commercial appeal
and then this heartachell get chased away

verse two
i was parttime at the tasty prawn
that and moving furniture and cutting lawns
covered in newsprint staying up real late
just holding out for some fate

chorus
sometimes i think that ill find a love
one thats gonna change my heart
ill find it in commercial appeal
and then this heartachell get chased away
sometimes i think that ill find a love
one thats gonna change my heart
ill find it in commercial appeal
and then this heartachell get chased away

i was dreaming in the drivers seat
when the right words just came to me
and all my finer feelings came up
always out on some witchs hunt
for the one who never lets me want
before you know it its all fuss

chorus
sometimes i think that ill find a love
one thats gonna change my heart
ill find it in commercial appeal
and then this heartachell get chased away
sometimes i think that ill find a love
one thats gonna change my heart
ill find it in commercial appeal
and then this heartachell get chased away1embed"
