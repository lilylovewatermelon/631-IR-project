i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own

instrumental interlude

verse 2 chris martin
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemys eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead long live the king
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

chorus chris martin
i hear jerusalem bells aringin
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
once youd gone there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world

verse 3 chris martin
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldnt believe what id become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string mmm mmm
aw who would ever wanna be king

chorus chris martin
i hear jerusalem bells aringin
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
i know saint peter wont call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
