make up the me i want to be
then always keep a finger on the pulse
maintain high visibility

grubbing for any contact i can make
then dig in deep to get ahead
line up the prospects that i think
will take
you know you have to use your head
and inability remains protected
the company i keep
wont let me ever be rejected

and inability remains protected
