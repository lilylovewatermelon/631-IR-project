its a big big world
its easy to get lost in it
youve always been my girl
and im not ready to call it quits

we can make the sun shine in the moonlight
we can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
i know its hard
baby believe me

chorus
that we can go nowhere but up from here my dear
baby we can go nowhere but up
tell me what we got to fear
well take it to the sky past the moon through the galaxy
as long as youre with me baby
honestly with the strength of our love
we can go nowhere but up
