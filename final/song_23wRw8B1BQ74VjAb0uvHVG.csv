truth is we were burning like a flame
looking back i couldnt tell you when it happened
has it been 20 years or 20 days
shouldve picked her over whiskey
layed down my foolish pride
i know it felt different when she kissed me
i guess ive never been a kiss goodbye
well ive tried other women
they never felt the same
but i think what hurts the most is knowing im to blame

and i wish that i could change it
and it wouldnt be this painful
cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin with an angel

well your eyes are like a north alabama sunset
and your smiles like florida in the spring
i keep on booking shows but you aint come yet
even though youre in every song i sing
cant say i dont deserve it
for putting you through hell
people keep asking if it was worth it
i tell them this its still to soon to tell
well ive tried every whiskey
from jim to jack to crown
but losing you is the only thing that burns me going down
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likeand i wish that i could change it
and it wouldnt be this painful
cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin with an angel

truth is youre better off alone
and the best thing i can do is let you go
holding you was heaven but losing you was hell
i shouldve known the devil had no business runnin with an angel
runnin with an angel
runnin with an angelembed"
