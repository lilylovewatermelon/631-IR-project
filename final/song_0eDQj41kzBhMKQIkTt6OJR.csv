shall i keep rolling

verse 1
well oh they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of thats what the point is not
the points that there int no romance around there
and theres the truth that they cant see
theyd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see em then you would agree
agree that there int no romance around there

chorus
you know oh its a funny thing you know
well tell em if you like well tell em all tonight
theyll never listen because their minds are made up
and course its all okay to carry on that way

verse 2
cause over there theres broken bones
theres only music so that theres new ringtones
and it dont take no sherlock holmes
to see its a little different around here
dont get me wrong though theres boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just cause hes had a couple of cans
he thinks its all right to act like a dickhead
you might also likechorus
dont you know oh its a funny thing you know
well tell em if you like well tell em all tonight
theyll never listen because their minds are made up
and course its all okay to carry on that way

bridge
but i said no oh no
well you wont get me to go
not anywhere not anywhere
no i wont go oh no no

instrumental break

verse 3
but over there theres friends of mine
what can i say ive known em for a long long time
and they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no not in the same way
said not in the same way
oh no oh no no
