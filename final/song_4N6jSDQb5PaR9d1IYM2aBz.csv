every kid with me grew together im proud of us
from a sunken place to the top
and look at what we accomplished
everything that you talked about
and i can tell you what it means but its not enough
man this shit aint what it seem where you watch it from
i done took a l on every corner like a swastika
and i only show your ass the cream when the crops are cut
i just hope you think about everything when you play this song
dont take that shit too serious ah ah
