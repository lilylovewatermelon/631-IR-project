dont waste your touch you wont feel anything
or were you sent to save me
ive thought too much you wont find anything
worthy of redeeming

prechorus
yo he estado aquí muchas veces antes y regresó

chorus
to break down and cease all feeling
burn now what once was breathing
reach out and you may take my heart away

verse 2
imperfect cry and scream in ecstasy
so what befalls the flawless
look what ive built please dont do this
it shines so beautifully why wont you look at me
now watch as it destroys me

prechorus
y regreso aquí otra vez y comienzo

chorus
to break down and cease all feeling
burn now what once was breathing
reach out and you may take my heart away
you might also likebreak down and cease all feeling
burn now what once was breathing
reach out and you may take my heart away

bridge
i left it all behind and never said goodbye
i left it all behind and never said goodbye
i left it all behind and never said goodbye
i left it all to die

i saw its birth i watched it grow
i felt it change me
i took the life i ate it slow
now it consumes me

chorus
break down and cease all feeling
burn now what once was breathing
reach out and you may take my heart away
break down and cease all feeling
burn now what once was breathing
reach out and you may take my heart away
heart away4embed"
