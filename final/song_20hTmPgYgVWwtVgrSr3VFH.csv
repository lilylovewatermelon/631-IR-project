when our embrace is over
all thats left is the world
its a mighty cold town
to be wanderin around
without rosie my girl

the floor is about to give way
to the weight of the words
youve been dyin to say
we could save this house
if youd just say â€˜em now
oh rosie my girl

well silence is a mighty big grave
and whatever goes down there
is as cold as the clay
wont you keep me warm
tell me what ive done wrong
oh rosie my girlsee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeembed"
