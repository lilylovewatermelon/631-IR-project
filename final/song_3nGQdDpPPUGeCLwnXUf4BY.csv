i admit that in the past ive been a nasty
they werent kidding when they called me kinda strange
but youll find that nowadays
ive mended all my ways
repented seen the light and made a change
and i fortunately know a little secret
its a talent that i always have possessed
and dear lady please dont laugh
i use it on behalf
of the miserable the lonely and depressed pathetic

chorus
poor unfortunate souls
in pain
in need
this one longing to be thinner
that one wants to get the girl
and do i help them
yes indeed
those poor unfortunate souls
so sad
so true
they come flocking to me crying
will you help us pretty please
and i help them
yes i do

the men up there dont like a lot of blabber
they think a girl who gossips is a bore
yes on land its much preferred for ladies not to say a word
and after all dear what is idle prattle for
theyre not all that impressed with conversation
true gentlemen avoid it when they can
but they dote and swoon and fawn
on ladies who withdrawn
its she who holds her tongue who gets a man

chorus
poor unfortunate souls
go ahead
make your choice
im a very busy person and i havent got all day
it wont cost much
just your voice
those poor unfortunate souls
so sad
so true
if you wanna cross the bridge my sweet
youve got the pay the toll
take a gulp
take a breath
go ahead
sign the scroll

now ive got her boys
the boss is on a roll

verse 3
