all is forgiven baby come on get dressed youre my date to the pep rally tonight
sung
you chucked me out like i was trash
for that you should be dead
but but but
then it hit me like a flash
what if high school went away instead
those assholes are the key
theyre keeping you away from me
they made you blind messed up your mind
but i can set you free
you left me and i fell apart
i punched the wall and cried
bam bam bam
then i found you changed my heart
and set loose all that truthful shit inside
and so i built a bomb
tonight our school is vietnam
lets guarantee they never see their senior prom
i was meant to be yours
we were meant to be one
dont give up on me now
finish what weve begun
i was meant to be yours
you might also likeso when the high school gym goes boom with everyone inside
pkhw pkhw pkhw
in the rubble of their tomb
well plant this note explaining why they died
jd  students spoken
we the students of westerburg high will die
our burnt bodies may finally get through to you
your society churns out slaves and blanks no thanks
signed the students of westerburg high
goodbye

jd
well watch the smoke pour out the doors
bring marshmallows well make smores
we can smile and cuddle while the fire roars

jd  students
i was meant to be yours
we were meant to be one
i cant make it alone
finish what weve begun
you were meant to be mine
i am all that you need
you carved open my heart
cant just leave me to bleed
veronica open the— open the door please
