two sides twist and then collide
youre calling off the guards am i coming
im coming through am i coming
adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
you know sometimes it just feels better to give in
sometimes it just feels better to give in

chorus
and its all too familiar
and it happens all the time
all the cards begin to stack up
twisting heartache into fine
little pieces that avoid an awful crime
but its you i cant deny
you i cant deny

verse 2
dull heat rises from the sheets
im both a patient boy
well and a jealous man am i coming
my double standardized suspicion
is remedied oh my blue heaven
sometimes it just feels better to give in
sometimes it just feels better to give in

and its all too familiar
and it happens all the time
all the cards begin to stack up
twisting heartache into fine
little pieces that avoid an awful crime
but its you i cant deny
you i cant deny

bridge
we swing and we sway
as this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
youre safe child you are safe
youre safe child you are safe
youre safe child you are safe
we swing and we sway
as this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
youre safe child you are safe
youre safe child you are
safe safe safe safe
you are safe
we swing and we sway
as this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
youre safe child you are safe am i coming
youre safe child you are safe am i
coming through
outro
is this all too familiar
does it happen all the time
im just asking you to hear me
could you please just once just hear me
more than anything you wanted to be right
still its you you its you i cant deny
you i cant deny
its you i cant deny1embed"
