a billion people died on the news tonight
but not so many cried at the terrible sight

its just make believe
you cant believe everything you see

so baby close your eyes to the lullabies
on the news tonight

verse 2
whos the one to decide that it would be alright
to put the music behind the news tonight

you cant believe everything you hear
the diegetic world is so unclear

hook 2
so baby close your ears
on the news tonight on the news tonight

the unobtrusive tones on the news tonight
and mama said mmm
why dont the newscasters cry when they read about people who die
at least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes
