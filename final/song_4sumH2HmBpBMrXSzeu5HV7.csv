verse 1
just charge it to my account
i hope i havent gone over my limit
with interest rates so swift

ill get to them somehow

please myself by living my life too

how i feel about you
how i feel about you yeah

verse 2
yes i recall
skipping on breakfast to play basketball
and feeling two feet small
sometimes you read like william shakes
your scent is sweet like betty crocker bakes
id love to have your cake and eat it too
