you called it our love refrain
now its gone and i am left completely
im out in the cold again

i dreamed that our love would linger
but just just memories remain
i gaze at a ringless finger
looks like im out in the cold again

so true it hurts my pride
to step aside for somebody new
o but deep down inside
my whole world depended on you

i wanted your arms around me
to shelter to shelter me from the rain
oh but now i back where i started
oh im out in the cold again
oh im out in the cold again
one more time
im out in the cold againyou might also likeembed"
