poor guy that man john thomas
his woman truly was a devil
and she wasnt all that honest
she tore him down on every level

chorus
youre a nogood lazy motherfucker
got a a shit job you worthless motherfucker
youre a a deadbeat feel sorry for your mother
if i i had time id trade you for another

bridgechorus
he dont like that he wants his life back
he wants go back home

verse 2
he tried so hard to please her
he sold his soul to keep her happy
but nothing he did impressed her
she always left him feeling shitty

chorus
this is it no this cant be all you bought me
said im im high class and this is where you brought me
gonna strike low just like my mama taught me
youre a a lowlife and lucky that you got me
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likebridge
he dont like that he wants his life back
he wants go back home

verse 2
down deep way down inside him
the will to leave was growing stronger
and he bit his tongue for so long
he couldnt hold back any longer

chorus
youre a twofaced ruthless instigator
youre a a low down trifling masquerader
youre a a cold bitch controlling conversator
this is too much im out ill see you later

outro
she dont like that but he got his life back
no she dont like that but hes right back on track
i said he went back home4embed"
