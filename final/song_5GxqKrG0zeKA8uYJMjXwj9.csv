i know you like that you want to try that
its like a flashback so shake your ass crack

funk the bluesa any groove to
make your move ‘cause taking you to
another landscape is my mandate
im highly animated even though im decomposin
so if your feet is frozen ima die to see you ropin

chorus del the funky homosapien
tap your toes and clap your hands
how many people ready to rock the house
come on trace the globe and shake your pants
how many people ready to rock the house
just twist your hip and do the dip
how many people ready to rock the house
come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
how many people ready to rock the house

gravitational pullll have you making a fool
out of yourself on the dance floor
doing back spins running man and more
party down with vigor and candor
coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
and do the aqua boogie win lots of goodies maybe
pop a gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
its awfully groovy seeing all the treasure and the booty

verse 3 del the funky homosapien
i want to get down lower than atlantis
going toe to toe with an enchantress
get funkier than funkadelic wearing pampers
while you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
sharing transcripts while we over here
dipping and dancing rhythm romancing
wallflowers giving no action no
all hours we chillin and maxin
so relaxin opposites attractin
ima toss my hat in floss when the track spin
like im on a crack bend jigglin and wigglin
freaking booties speaking to the cuties so belligerent
no religion just bump the feed on
youll feel reborn negativity we just dead it like decoy
better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
the pulse when it responds

chorus del the funky homosapien
tap your toes and clap your hands
how many people ready to rock the house
come on trace the globe and shake your pants
how many people ready to rock the house
just twist your hip and do the dip
how many people ready to rock the house
come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
how many people ready to rock the house18embed"
