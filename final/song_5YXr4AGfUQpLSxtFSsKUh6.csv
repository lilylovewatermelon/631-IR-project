verse 1
fear and panic in the air
i want to be free from desolation and despair
and i feel like everything i sow
is being swept away well i refuse to let you go

prechorus
i cant get it right
get it right
since i met you

chorus
loneliness be over
when will this loneliness be over

verse 2
life will flash before my eyes
so scattered and lost i want to touch the other side
and no one thinks they are to blame
why cant we see that when we bleed we bleed the same

prechorus
i cant get it right
get it right
since i met you

when will this loneliness be over14embed"
