i dont need to be anything other
than a prison guards son
i dont need to be anything other
than a specialists son
i dont have to be anyone other
than a birth of two souls in one

prechorus 1
part of where im going
is knowing where im coming from

chorus
i dont wanna be
anything other than what ive been tryna be lately

im tired of looking round rooms
wondering what ive gotta do
or who im supposed to be
i dont wanna be anything other than me

verse 2

everywhere i turn
im surrounded by imposters
everywhere i turn
im surrounded by identity crisis
everywhere i turn
