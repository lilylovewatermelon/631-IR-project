guarding yourself from the love of another
left you with nothing tonight
why does it sound like the devil is laughing
leaving me haunted tonight
you did decide

verse 1
now i want you when youre gone and now its like
youre holding something just in front of me
well then i cant allow this to become another
one of those times that im left in the cold dead
theres no compromise
just another tie
i know i need to sever

chorus
guarding yourself from the love of another
left you with nothing tonight
why does it sound like the devil is laughing
leaving me haunted tonight
you did decide

verse 2
ever haunted by the trappings of this life
sweet redemption just in front of me
well now it seems once again that ive lost another
one of the ones that have broke through the wall damned
fate wont compromise
i have sold my soul
and now the devils laughing
you did decide

you were bold and strong and ready to begin your life
all for nothing you were sacrificed
you began alone and so it will be when you die
all for nothing will you be remembered
you did decide

outro
guarding yourself from the love of another
left you with nothing tonight
so now you know why the devil is laughing
he left you with nothing tonight
you did decide1embed"
