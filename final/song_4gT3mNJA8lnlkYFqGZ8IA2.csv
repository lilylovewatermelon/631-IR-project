yeah got a bad attitude playin til im out of moves
no need for shame i get mo peace at slow speeds
go beat the game young control freak
its cold in my veins im below freezin snow season made me
they know that i so need my space
dont wanna grow old so i smoke just in case
she say that i glow below the waist
and the stroke is just so pga
all i got is a little bit of space and time
drawin shapes and lines of a world we made
tomorrow may be right around the corner
but i swear its gon be worth it if i make you wait
theres somewhere above you keep reachin up

verse 3
yeah nine times out of ten i get it wrong
thats why i wrote this song tell myself to hold on
i can feel my fingers slippin
in a motherfuckin instant ill be gone
do you want it all if its all mediocre
starin at the wall and the wall full of posters
lookin at my dreams who i wanna be
i guess you gotta see it to believe
ooh i been a fool but its cool thats what human beings do
keep your eyes to the sky never glued to your shoes
guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
but the sun comin out now clouds start to move
dont tell me nothin but the truth
im tired i dont got a spare second
win or lose win or lose
i dont keep count nobody checkin43embed"
