lithium
dont wanna lock me up inside
lithium
dont wanna forget how it feels without
lithium
i wanna stay in love with my sorrow oh
but god i wanna let it go

verse 1
come to bed dont make me sleep alone
couldnt hide the emptiness you let it show
never wanted it to be so cold
just didnt drink enough to say you love me

prechorus
i cant hold on to me
wonder whats wrong with me

dont wanna let it lay me down this time
drown my will to fly
here in the darkness i know myself
cant break free until i let it go
let me go

verse 2
darling i forgive you after all
anything is better than to be alone
and in the end i guess i had to fall
always find my place among the ashes

i cant hold on to me
wonder whats wrong with me
