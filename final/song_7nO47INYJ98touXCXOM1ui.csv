shame on you seducin everyone
you faded jewel you diamond in the rough
you dont have to tell me i know where youve been
shinin once again

verse 2
will you do the thing youve always done
tell me true i think you know the one
one that makes me blurry colors start to run

prechorus 1
every time i wonder
i go under

chorus
the deeper the blues the more i see black
sweeter the bruise the feelin starts comin back
all the deepest blues are black

verse 3
how my mind is spinnin and my head is goin numb
right from the beginnin our endin had begun
i can be your trouble shiver into you

prechorus 2
shakin like the thunder
sinkin under

the deeper the blues the more i see black
sweeter the bruise the feelin starts comin back
all the deepest blues are deepest blues are black

bridge
when it comes closin in
reject cause i gotta move
and the simple things get in the openings
connect become something new
to remove

chorus
the deeper the blues the more i see black
sweeter the bruise the feelin starts comin back
all the deepest blues are deepest blues are black
the deeper the blues the more i see black
sweeter the bruise the feelin starts comin back
all the deepest blues are deepest blues are black2embed"
