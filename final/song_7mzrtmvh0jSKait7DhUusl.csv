all around the water tank waiting for a train
a thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
i walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
he said if youve got money ill see that you dont walk
well i havent got a nickel not a penny can i show
he said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door

verse 2
well he put me off in texas a state i dearly love
the wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
im on my way from frisco heading back to dixie land
my pocketbook is empty my heart is full of pain
im a thousand miles away from home waiting for a trainyou might also likeembed"
