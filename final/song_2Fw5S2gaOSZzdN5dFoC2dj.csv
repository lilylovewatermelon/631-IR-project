uhuh fuck that

chorus kendrick lamar
eight doobies to the face fuck that
twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
two pills and a halfweight nigga fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age dont exist

verse 1 kendrick lamar
man i swear my nigga trippin off that shit again
pick him up then i set him in cold water
then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope that take the pain away
from the feelin that he feel today
you know when you part of section80
you feel like no one can relate
cause you are you are a loner loner
marijuana endorphins make you stronger stronger
im in the house party trippin off
my generation sippin cough syrup like its water
never no pancakes in the kitchen
man not one of our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition that the world is bout to end
who gives a fuck we never do listen
less it comes with an 808 a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank technology bought my soul
lookin around and all i see is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream
yep her president is black she black too
purple label on her back but that tab is light blue
she take it straight to the head then she look at me
she got adhd

verse 2 kendrick lamar
and then she started
and then she started feelin herself like no one else in this apartment
beg your pardon oh i rap baby how old are you
she say twentytwo i say twentythree okay then we are crack babies damn
why you say that she said where my drink at
ima tell you later just tell your neighbors and the police relax
i stood up shut the blind closed the screen jumbotron
made to the back where she reside then she said read between the lines yep
hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up when the nuvo start to drown
her body and i know the both of us really deep in the mood now
its nothin we can do now somebody walked in with a pound woah
of that bay area kush she looked at me then looked
at it then she grabbed it then she said get it understood
you know why we crack babies because we born in the 80s
the adhd crazy
