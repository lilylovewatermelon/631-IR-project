one night with you
is what im now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true

verse 2
just call my name
and ill be right by your side
i want your sweet helping hand
my loves too strong to hide

chorus
always lived very quiet life
i aint never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
has been too lonely too long
