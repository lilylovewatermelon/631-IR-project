missing data
sponsors get the answer they want


before we get going we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt industryfunded trials are more likely to produce a positive flattering result than independentlyfunded trials this is our core premise and you’re about to read a very short chapter because this is one of the most welldocumented phenomena in the growing field of ‘research about research’ it has also become much easier to study in recent years because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer

we can begin with some recent work in 2010 three researchers from harvard and toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug – antidepressants ulcer drugs and so on – then measured two key features were they positive and were they funded by industry1 they found over five hundred trials in total 85 per cent of the industryfunded studies were positive but only 50 per cent of the governmentfunded trials were that’s a very significant difference

in 2007 researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin2 these are cholesterollowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack they are prescribed in very large quantities and they will loom large in this book this study found 192 trials in total either comparing one statin against another or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment once the researchers controlled for other factors we’ll delve into what this means later they found that industryfunded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug again that’s a very big difference

we’ll do one more in 2006 researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a tenyear period finding 542 trial outcomes in total industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time while independentlyfunded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases if you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor’s drug in a trial you were in for a pretty rough ride you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time3

these are dismal frightening results but they come from individual studies when there has been lots of research in a field it’s always possible that someone – like me for example – could cherrypick the results and give a partial view i could in essence be doing exactly what i accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing and only telling you about the studies that support my case while hiding the reassuring ones from you

to guard against this risk researchers invented the systematic review we’ll explore this in more detail soon p14 since it’s at the core of modern medicine but in essence a systematic review is simple instead of just mooching through the research literature consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your preexisting beliefs you take a scientific systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done

systematic reviews are very very onerous in 2003 by coincidence two were published both looking specifically at the question we’re interested in they took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with proindustry results each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers and both found that industryfunded trials were overall about four times more likely to report positive results4 a further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews it found twenty more pieces of work and all but two showed that industrysponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results5

i am setting out this evidence at length because i want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue industrysponsored trials give favourable results and that is not my opinion or a hunch from the occasional passing study this is a very welldocumented problem and it has been researched extensively without anybody stepping out to take effective action as we shall see

there is one last study i’d like to tell you about it turns out that this pattern of industryfunded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences where data often appears for the first time in fact as we shall see sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference with very little information on how the study was conducted

fries and krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 american college of rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial and acknowledged industry sponsorship in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor’s drug there is a small punchline coming and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like in general the results section is extensive the raw numbers are given for each outcome and for each possible causal factor but not just as raw figures the ‘ranges’ are given subgroups are perhaps explored statistical tests are conducted and each detail of the result is described in table form and in shorter narrative form in the text explaining the most important results this lengthy process is usually spread over several pages
in fries and krishnan 2004 this level of detail was unnecessary the results section is a single simple and – i like to imagine – fairly passiveaggressive sentence

the results from every rct 45 out of 45 favored the drug of the sponsor

this extreme finding has a very interesting side effect for those interested in timesaving shortcuts since every industrysponsored trial had a positive result that’s all you’d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome if it was funded by industry you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great

how does this happen how do industrysponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result it is as far as anyone can be certain a combination of factors it may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they’re more confident their treatment is going to ‘win’ this sounds reasonable although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there’s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best otherwise you’re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws you can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish – an existing drug at an inadequate dose perhaps or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing you can choose your patients very carefully so they are more likely to get better on your treatment you can peek at the results halfway through and stop your trial early if they look good which is – for interesting reasons we shall discuss – statistical poison and so on

but before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not there is something very much simpler at hand

sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials and when they see that the results are unflattering they simply fail to publish them this is not a new problem and it’s not limited to medicine in fact this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science it distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies and despite everything that regulators drug companies and even some academics will tell you it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades

in fact it is so deeprooted that even if we fixed it today – right now for good forever without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation – that still wouldn’t help because we would still be practising medicine cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is – as you’ve now seen – fundamentally distorted

but there is a way ahead

why missing data matters

reboxetine is a drug i myself have prescribed other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient so we wanted to try something new i’d read the trial data before i wrote the prescription and found only welldesigned fair tests with overwhelmingly positive results reboxetine was better than placebo and as good as any other antidepressant in headtohead comparisons it’s approved for use by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency the mhra which governs all drugs in the uk millions of doses are prescribed every year around the world reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment the patient and i discussed the evidence briefly and agreed it was the right treatment to try next i signed a piece of paper a prescription saying i wanted my patient to have this drug

but we had both been misled in october 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine6 through a long process of investigation – searching in academic journals but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators – they were able to assemble all the data both from trials that were published and from those that had never appeared in academic papers

when all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo only one conducted in 254 patients had a neat positive result and that one was published in an academic journal for doctors and researchers to read but six more trials were conducted in almost ten times as many patients all of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill none of these trials was published i had no idea they existed

it got worse the trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture three small studies 507 patients in total showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug they were all published but 1657 patients’ worth of data was left unpublished and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs if all this wasn’t bad enough there was also the sideeffects data the drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature but when we saw the unpublished studies it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects more likely to drop out of taking the drug and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors
if you’re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry – and i promise you whatever happens i will keep to the data and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know – you need only look at this story i did everything a doctor is supposed to do i read all the papers i critically appraised them i understood them i discussed them with the patient and we made a decision together based on the evidence in the published data reboxetine was a safe and effective drug in reality it was no better than a sugar pill and worse it does more harm than good as a doctor i did something which on the balance of all the evidence harmed my patient simply because unflattering data was left unpublished

if you find that amazing or outrageous your journey is just beginning because nobody broke any law in that situation reboxetine is still on the market and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play for all drugs in all countries in the world negative data goes missing for all treatments in all areas of science the regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us

in a few pages we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt showing that ‘publication bias’ – the process whereby negative results go unpublished – is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia and that regulators have failed to do anything about it despite decades of data showing the size of the problem but before we get to that research i need you to feel its implications so we need to think about why missing data matters

evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works – or doesn’t work – in medicine we proceed by testing things as cautiously as we can in headtohead trials and gathering together all of the evidence this last step is crucial if i withhold half the data from you it’s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn’t true if i toss a coin a hundred times for example but only tell you about the results when it lands headsup i can convince you that this is a twoheaded coin but that doesn’t mean i really do have a twoheaded coin it means i’m misleading you and you’re a fool for letting me get away with it this is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine and always have researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish and then choose which ones to publish

the repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients and way beyond trials medical research isn’t an abstract academic pursuit it’s about people so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real living people to unnecessary avoidable suffering

tgn1412

in march 2006 six volunteers arrived at a london hospital to take place in a trial it was the first time a new drug called tgn1412 had ever been given to humans and they were paid £2000 each7 within an hour these six men developed headaches muscle aches and a feeling of unease then things got worse high temperatures restlessness periods of forgetting who and where they were soon they were shivering flushed their pulses racing their blood pressure falling then a cliff one went into respiratory failure the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid nobody knew why another dropped his blood pressure to just 6540 stopped breathing properly and was rushed to an intensive care unit knocked out intubated mechanically ventilated within a day all six were disastrously unwell fluid on their lungs struggling to breathe their kidneys failing their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies and their white blood cells disappearing doctors threw everything they could at them steroids antihistamines immunesystem receptor blockers all six were ventilated on intensive care they stopped producing urine they were all put on dialysis their blood was replaced first slowly then rapidly they needed plasma red cells platelets the fevers continued one developed pneumonia and then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries their fingers and toes went flushed then brown then black and then began to rot and die with heroic effort all escaped at least with their lives

the department of health convened an expert scientific group to try to understand what had happened and from this two concerns were raised8 firstly can we stop things like this from happening again it’s plainly foolish for example to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a ‘firstinman’ trial at the same time if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity new drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process slowly over a day this idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media

less noted was a second concern could we have foreseen this disaster tgn1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called cd28 on the white blood cells of the immune system it was a new and experimental treatment and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood and hard to model in animals unlike say blood pressure because immune systems are very variable between different species but as the final report found there was experience with a similar intervention it had simply not been published one researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier using an antibody that attached to the cd3 cd2 and cd28 receptors the effects of this antibody had parallels with those of tgn1412 and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell but nobody could possibly have known that because these results were never shared with the scientific community they sat unpublished unknown when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying destructive avoidable ordeal

that original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to and it’s hard to blame him as an individual because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal the same culture exists today the final report on tgn1412 concluded that sharing the results of all firstinman studies was essential they should be published every last one as a matter of routine but phase 1 trial results weren’t published then and they’re still not published now in 2009 for the first time a study was published looking specifically at how many of these firstinman trials get published and how many remain hidden9 they took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year after four years nine out of ten remain unpublished after eight years four out of five were still unpublished

in medicine as we shall see time and again research is not abstract it relates directly to life death suffering and pain with every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed quite unnecessarily to another tgn1412 even a huge international news story with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds wasn’t enough to get movement because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence

when we don’t share the results of basic research such as a small firstinman study we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future was this an extreme case is the problem limited to early experimental new drugs in small groups of trial participants no

in the 1980s doctors began giving antiarrhythmic drugs to all patients who’d had a heart attack this practice made perfect sense on paper we knew that antiarrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms we also knew that people who’ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms we also knew that often these went unnoticed undiagnosed and untreated giving antiarrhythmic drugs to everyone who’d had a heart attack was a simple sensible preventive measure
unfortunately it turned out that we were wrong this prescribing practice with the best of intentions on the best of principles actually killed people and because heart attacks are very common it killed them in very large numbers well over 100000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm

could anyone have predicted this sadly yes they could have a trial in 1980 tested a new antiarrhythmic drug lorcainide in a small number of men who’d had a heart attack – less than a hundred – to see if it was any use nine out of fortyeight men on lorcainide died compared with one out of fortyseven on placebo the drug was early in its development cycle and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons because it wasn’t on the market nobody even thought to publish the trial the researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule and gave it no further thought if they had published we would have been much more cautious about trying other antiarrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks and the phenomenal death toll – over 100000 people in their graves prematurely – might have been stopped sooner more than a decade later the researchers finally did publish their results with a mea culpa recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier

when we carried out our study in 1980 we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons and this study was therefore never published it is now a good example of ‘publication bias’ the results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead10

as we shall shortly see this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine and indeed the whole of academia even though the scale of the problem and the harm it causes have been documented beyond any doubt we will see stories on basic cancer research tamiflu cholesterol blockbusters obesity drugs antidepressants and more with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day and data that is still being withheld right now as i write on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning we will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem

because researchers are free to bury any result they please patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine from research to practice doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give does this drug really work best or have i simply been deprived of half the data nobody can tell is this expensive drug worth the money or have the data simply been massaged no one can tell will this drug kill patients is there any evidence that it’s dangerous no one can tell

this is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence and where everyday practice is bound up in medicolegal anxiety in one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we’ve taken our eyes off the ball and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted it seems unimaginable we will now see how deep this problem goes

why we summarise data

missing data has been studied extensively in medicine but before i lay out that evidence we need to understand exactly why it matters from a scientific perspective and for that we need to understand systematic reviews and ‘metaanalysis’ between them these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine they are incredibly simple but they were invented shockingly late

when we want to find out if something works or not we do a trial this is a very simple process and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the bible daniel 112 if you’re interested firstly you need an unanswered question for example ‘does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving’ then you find some relevant participants in this case mothers about to deliver a premature baby you’ll need a reasonable number of them let’s say two hundred for this trial then you divide them into two groups at random give the mothers in one group the current best treatment whatever that is in your town while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids finally when all two hundred women have gone through your trial you count up how many babies survived in each group

this is a realworld question and lots of trials were done on this topic starting from 1972 onwards two trials showed that steroids saved lives but five showed no significant benefit now you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed and this is exactly that kind of situation a doctor with a strong preexisting belief that steroids work – perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism by which the drug might do something useful in the body – could come along and say ‘look at these two positive trials of course we must give steroids’ a doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say ‘overall the evidence shows no benefit why take a risk’

up until very recently this was basically how medicine progressed people would write long languorous review articles – essays surveying the literature – in which they would cite the trial data they’d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion often reflecting their own prejudices and values then in the 1980s people began to do something called a ‘systematic review’ this is a clear systematic survey of the literature with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic without being biased towards any particular set of findings in a systematic review you describe exactly how you looked for data which databases you searched which search engines and indexes you used even what words you searched for you prespecify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review and then you present everything you’ve found including the papers you rejected with an explanation of why by doing this you ensure that your methods are fully transparent replicable and open to criticism providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence it may sound like a simple idea but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years

when you’ve got all the trial data in one place you can conduct something called a metaanalysis where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet pool all the data and get one single summary figure the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question the output of this is called a ‘blobbogram’ and you can see one on the opposite page in the logo of the cochrane collaboration a global nonprofit academic organisation that has been producing goldstandard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s

this blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive each horizontal line is a trial if that line is further to the left then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives the central vertical line is the ‘line of no effect’ and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines these were smaller trials with fewer participants which means they are prone to more error so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty and therefore the horizontal line is longer finally the diamond at the bottom shows the ‘summary effect’ this is the overall benefit of the intervention pooling together the results of all the individual trials these are much narrower than the lines for individual trials because the estimate is much more accurate it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients on this blobbogram you can see – because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect – that giving steroids is hugely beneficial in fact it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half

the amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented and this happened very late in medicine’s history for many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives but nobody knew they were effective because nobody did a systematic review until 1989 as a result the treatment wasn’t given widely and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily not because we didn’t have the information but simply because we didn’t synthesise it together properly

in case you think this is an isolated case it’s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times the diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms or ‘forest plots’ showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase a clotbusting drug improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack11

look first only at the forest plot on the left this is a conventional forest plot from an academic journal so it’s a little busier than the stylised one in the cochrane logo the principles however are exactly the same each horizontal line is a trial and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results with some trials showing a benefit they don’t touch the vertical line of no effect headed ‘1’ and some showing no benefit they do cross that line at the bottom however you can see the summary effect – a dot on this oldfashioned blobbogram rather than a diamond and you can see very clearly that overall streptokinase saves lives

so what’s that on the right it’s something called a cumulative metaanalysis if you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram you can see that they are arranged in order of date the cumulative metaanalysis on the right adds in each new trial’s results as they arrived over history to the previous trials’ results this gives the best possible running estimate each year of how the evidence would have looked at that time if anyone had bothered to do a metaanalysis on all the data available to them from this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines the ‘summary effects’ narrow over time as more and more data is collected and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate you can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago – and crucially they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack

in case you haven’t spotted it for yourself already – to be fair the entire medical profession was slow to catch on – this chart has devastating implications heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death we had a treatment that worked and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked but once again we didn’t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase i think unethically because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked they were deprived of effective treatments but they weren’t alone because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time

these stories illustrate i hope why systematic reviews and metaanalyses are so important we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question not just cherrypick the bits that we stumble upon or intuitively like the look of mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades and systematic reviews with metaanalyses are now used almost universally to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question

but these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous if one researcher or doctor ‘cherrypicks’ when summarising the existing evidence and looks only at the trials that support their hunch then they can produce a misleading picture of the research that is a problem for that one individual and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them but if we are all missing the negative trials the entire medical and academic community around the world then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works – as we must do – we are all completely misled we get a misleading impression of the treatment’s effectiveness we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial when in reality it did harm

now that you understand the importance of systematic reviews you can see why missing data matters but you can also appreciate that when i explain how much trial data is missing i am giving you a clean overview of the literature because i will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews

how much data is missing

if you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished you have an interesting problem you need to prove the existence of studies you don’t have access to to work around this people have developed a simple approach you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed then check to see if they have been published finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job and to achieve it people have used various strategies trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees or ‘institutional review boards’ in the usa for example or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences

in 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the us food and drug administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 200412 this was no small task the fda archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug but that’s not all the trials by any means because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there and the information that is provided by the fda is hard to search and often scanty but it is an important subset of the trials and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing and why it’s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies

the researchers found seventyfour studies in total representing 12500 patients’ worth of data thirtyeight of these trials had positive results and found that the new drug worked thirtysix were negative the results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs in reality then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature the material available to doctors and patients this provided a very different picture thirtyseven of the positive trials – all but one – were published in full often with much fanfare but the trials with negative results had a very different fate only three were published twentytwo were simply lost to history never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty disorganised thin fda files the remaining eleven which had negative results in the fda summaries did appear in the academic literature but were written up as if the drug was a success if you think this sounds absurd i agree we will see in chapter 4 on ‘bad trials’ how a study’s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings

this was a remarkable piece of work spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers with no standout bad guy it very clearly exposed a broken system in reality we have thirtyeight positive trials and thirtysix negative ones in the academic literature we have fortyeight positive trials and three negative ones take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind ‘thirtyeight positive trials thirtysix negative’ or ‘fortyeight positive trials and only three negative’

if we were talking about one single study from one single group of researchers who decided to delete half their results because they didn’t give the overall picture they wanted then we would quite correctly call that act ‘research misconduct’ yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs but with whole studies going missing by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals spread around the world in both the public and private sector we accept it as a normal part of life13 it passes by under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing as routine despite the undeniable impact it has on patients

even more strange is this we’ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science

this was first formally documented by a psychologist called theodore sterling in 195914 he went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result this he explained was plainly fishy it couldn’t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted because if we believed that we’d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct if psychologists really were so great at predicting results there’d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all in 1995 at the end of his career the same researcher came back to the same question half a lifetime later and found that almost nothing had changed15

sterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries francis bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked and forgetting those when it didn’t16 fowler in 1786 listed the cases he’d seen treated with arsenic and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures as others might be tempted to do but had included them17 to do otherwise he explained would have been misleading

yet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine in 1980 elina hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid1970s in finland and sweden had been left unpublished18 then in 1986 an american researcher called robert simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer this was an important study because it looked at a lifeordeath question combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects and knowing this many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single ‘alkylating agent’ drug first before moving on to full chemotherapy simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature read by doctors and academics from this giving a single drug first looked like a great idea women with advanced ovarian cancer which is not a good diagnosis to have who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer

then simes had a smart idea he knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished and he had heard that papers with less ‘exciting’ results are the most likely to go missing to prove that this has happened though is a tricky business you need to find a fair representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published to see if there are any embarrassing differences there was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator we will discuss this problem in some detail later so instead he went to the international cancer research data bank this contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the usa including most of the ones funded by the government and many others from around the world it was by no means a complete list but it did have one crucial feature the trials were registered before their results came in so any list compiled from this source would be if not complete at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative

when simes compared the results of the published trials against the preregistered trials the results were disturbing looking at the academic literature – the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish – alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly but when you looked only at the preregistered trials – the unbiased fair sample of all the trials ever conducted – the new treatment was no better than oldfashioned chemotherapy

simes immediately recognised – as i hope you will too – that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted to an extent that might be hard to measure but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care we were seeing the positive results and missing the negative ones there was one clear thing we should do about this start a registry of all clinical trials demand that people register their study before they start and insist that they publish the results at the end

that was 1986 since then a generation later we have done very badly in this book i promise i won’t overwhelm you with data but at the same time i don’t want any drug company or government regulator or professional body or anyone who doubts this whole story to have any room to wriggle so i’ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials as briefly as possible showing the main approaches that have been used all of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results

one research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature that’s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants and found that a 5050 split of positive and negative results turned into fortyeight positive papers and just three negative ones this method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine

    lee and colleagues for example looked for all of the 909 trials      submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new      drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002 they      found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results      were published compared with only 36 per cent of the rest19

    melander in 2003 looked for all fortytwo trials on five      antidepressants that were submitted to the swedish drug      regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation      all twentyone studies with significant results were published      only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published20

    rising et al in 2008 found more of those distorted writeups      that we’ll be dissecting later they looked for all trials on two      years’ worth of approved drugs in the fda’s summary of      the results once those could be found there were 164 trials      those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more      likely to be published in academic papers than those with      negative outcomes on top of that four of the trials with      negative outcomes changed once they appeared in the      academic literature to favour the drug21

if you prefer you can look at conference presentations a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature22 studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find or cite and are especially hard to assess because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research often as little as a paragraph and as you will see shortly not every trial is a fair test of a treatment some can be biased by design so these details matter

the most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010 and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations – in fields as diverse as anaesthetics cystic fibrosis oncology and ae – disappear before becoming fullyfledged academic papers23 overwhelmingly unflattering results are much more likely to go missing

if you’re very lucky you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question from the pharmaceutical industry up until very recently you’d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain for publiclyfunded research the story is a little different and here we start to learn a new lesson although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry with the result that they set the tone for the community this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector

    by 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review      on this approach they found that studies with significant      results were two and a half times more likely to get      published than those without24

    a paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of      triallists sponsored by the us national institutes of health over      the preceding ten years and found again that studies with      significant results were more likely to be published25

    another looked at drug trials notified to the finnish national      agency and found that 47 per cent of the positive results      were published but only 11 per cent of the negative ones26

    another looked at all the trials that had passed through the      pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963 93 per      cent of the significant results were published but only 70 per      cent of the negative ones27

the point being made in this blizzard of data is simple this is not an underresearched area the evidence has been with us for a long time and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous

two french studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach they went to ethics committees and got lists of all the studies they had approved and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results before finally tracking down the published academic papers28 the first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published the second that they were four times as likely in britain two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by nhs rd it’s not industry research but it’s worth noting anyway this produced an unusual result there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers29

but it’s not enough simply to list studies systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far what do we see overall

it’s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet to produce a summary figure on publication bias because they are all very different in different fields with different methods this is a concern in many metaanalyses though it shouldn’t be overstated if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo say and they’re all using the same outcome measurement then you might be fine just lumping them all in together

but you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups the most current systematic review on publication bias from 2010 from which the examples above are taken draws together the evidence from various fields30 twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 162 times more likely to be published for the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started overall significant results were 24 times more likely to be published those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem they are current and they are damning

all of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter in the real world of medicine published evidence is used to make treatment decisions this problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do so it’s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice firstly as we saw in the case of reboxetine doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering or even death we might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs this wastes money ultimately depriving patients of other treatments since funding for health care is never infinite

it’s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine from top to bottom nice for example is the national institute for health and clinical excellence created by the british government to conduct careful unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments it is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug’s effectiveness nice has no more legal right to that data than you or i do even though it is making decisions about effectiveness and costeffectiveness on behalf of the nhs for millions of people in fact as we shall see the mhra and ema the european medicines agency – the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the uk – often have access to this information but do not share it with the public with doctors or with nice this is an extraordinary and perverse situation

so while doctors are kept in the dark patients are exposed to inferior treatments ineffective treatments unnecessary treatments and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment and individual participants in trials such as those in the tgn1412 study are exposed to terrifying lifethreatening ordeals resulting in lifelong scars again quite unnecessarily

at the same time the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them this affects everyone but it is especially egregious in the world of ‘orphan diseases’ medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients because these corners of medicine are already short of resources and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies since the opportunities for revenue are thinner people working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease if the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm nobody can tell you

finally and perhaps most shamefully when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished we betray the patients who participated in these studies the people who have given their bodies and sometimes their lives in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future in fact their belief is not implicit often it’s exactly what we tell them as researchers and it is a lie because the data might be withheld and we know it

so whose fault is this

why do negative trials disappear

in a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data – in stories where we can identify individuals – sometimes with the assistance of regulators when we get to these i hope your rage might swell but first it’s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development and in completely unrelated fields of academia where people are motivated only by reputation and their own personal interests

in many respects after all publication bias is a very human process if you’ve done a study and it didn’t have an exciting positive result then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn’t very interesting to other researchers there’s also the issue of incentives academics are often measured rather unhelpfully by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers and the number of ‘highimpact’ studies they get into glamorous wellread journals if negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals and less likely to be cited by other academics then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower with a positive finding meanwhile you get a sense of discovering something new everyone around you is excited because your results are exceptional

one clear illustration of this problem came in 2010 a mainstream american psychology researcher called daryl bem published a competent academic paper in a wellrespected journal showing evidence of precognition the ability to see into the futurefn1 these studies were welldesigned and the findings were statistically significant but many people weren’t very convinced for the same reasons you aren’t if humans really could see into the future we’d probably know about it already and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence rather than oneoff findings

but in fact the study has been replicated though bem’s positive results have not been at least two groups of academics have rerun several of bem’s experiments using the exact same methods and both found no evidence of precognition one group submitted their negative results to the journal of personality and social psychology – the very same journal that published bem’s paper in 2010 – and that journal rejected their paper out of hand the editor even came right out and said it we never publish studies that replicate other work

here we see the same problem as in medicine positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones every now and then a freak positive result is published showing for example that people can see into the future who knows how many psychologists have tried over the years to find evidence of psychic powers running elaborate timeconsuming experiments on dozens of subjects – maybe hundreds – and then found no evidence that such powers exist any scientist trying to publish such a ‘so what’ finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously at the best of times even with the clear target of bem’s paper on precognition which was widely covered in serious newspapers across europe and the usa the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result yet replicating these findings was key – bem himself said so in his paper – so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too

people working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you’re hoping for appears what does that mean sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question many research findings remember are not absolute blackandwhite outcomes but fragile statistical correlations under our current system most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research in ways that are not immediately obvious for example researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they’ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke or because they’ve made some kind of mistake in their methods in fact the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work and you also need to be absolutely certain that you’ve excluded all technical problems to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate these barriers to refutation may partly explain why it’s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong31

publication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research in 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal nature how they tried to replicate fiftythree early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments fortyseven of the fiftythree could not be replicated32 this study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue researchers build theories on the back of them trust that they’re valid and investigate the same idea using other methods if they are simply being led down the garden path chasing up fluke errors then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded

the authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem fluke findings they explained are often more likely to be submitted to journals – and more likely to be published – than boring negative ones we should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results but we should also give them more opportunity

this means changing the behaviour of academic journals and here we are faced with a problem although they are usually academics themselves journal editors have their own interests and agendas and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia but this is the current situation journals are the gatekeepers they make decisions on what’s relevant and interesting for their audience and they compete for readers

this can lead them to behave in ways that don’t reflect the best interests of science because an individual journal’s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence in newspaper journalism there is a wellknown aphorism ‘when a dog bites a man that’s not news but when a man bites a dog …’ these judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively one study in 2003 for example looked at the bbc’s health news coverage over several months and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear 8571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking but there were three stories for every death from new variant cjd or ‘mad cow disease’33 another in 1992 looked at printmedia coverage of drug deaths and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper but every death from mdma received on average one piece of news coverage34

if similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals then we have a problem but can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use this argument is commonly deployed by industry and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse luckily this has been the subject of some research and overall while journals aren’t blameless it’s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious publichealth problem this is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions

but to be kind for the sake of completeness and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals we can see if what they claim is true

one survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication one hundred and twentyfour unpublished results were identified by following up on every study approved by a group of us ethics committees and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected35 perhaps you might say this was a freak finding another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal and see if those with negative results are rejected more often where this has been tried the journals seem blameless 745 manuscripts submitted to the journal of the american medical association jama were followed up and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and nonsignificant findings36 the same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the bmj the lancet annals of internal medicine and the journal of bone and joint surgery37 again and again no effect was found some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission to get past editors’ prejudices it’s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough

these studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice one last option is to run an experiment sending identical papers to various journals but changing the direction of the results at random to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates this isn’t something you’d want to do very often because it wastes a lot of people’s time but since publication bias matters it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions

in 1990 a researcher called epstein created a series of fictitious papers with identical methods and presentation differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results he sent them at random to 146 socialwork journals the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time a difference that wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant38

other studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale not submitting a paper to a journal but rather with the assistance of the journal sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers these people do not make the final decision on publication but they do give advice to editors so a window into their behaviour would be useful these studies have had more mixed results in one from 1977 sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventyfive reviewers some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views39

another study from 1994 looked at reviewers’ responses to a paper on tens machines these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief thirtythree reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their preexisting views though the study was small40 another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them41

one final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their preexisting beliefs a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers and they were all identical except for the results they reported half of the reviewers got results they would like half got results they wouldn’t reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they’d like 97 per cent vs 80 per cent more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn’t like and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked42

overall though even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains these results don’t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials in the experiments isolating the peer reviewers those individual referees were biased in some studies but they don’t have the last word on publication and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems journals may not be entirely innocent – the trouble with medical journals by richard smith previously editor of the bmj is an excellent overview of their faults43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies but it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door

in the light of all this the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing in various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results because they would just be rejected by journals 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 199844 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 199145 and so on46 if asked why they’ve failed to send in research for publication the most common reasons researchers give are negative results a lack of interest or a lack of time

this is the more abstract end of academia – largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials – but it seems that academics are mistaken at best about the reasons why negative results go missing journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results but they are hardly absolute and much of the problem lies in academics’ motivations and perceptions

more than that in recent years the era of openaccess academic journals has got going in earnest there are now several such as trials which are free to access and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report regardless of result and will actively solicit negative findings trials registers like clinicaltrialsgov will also post results with offers like this on the table it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to and yet despite this negative results continue to go missing with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them

you might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld the universities where research takes place for example or the regulators or the ‘ethics committees’ which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research unfortunately our story is about to take a turn to the dark side we will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have instead shirked their responsibilities and worse than that we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients we are about to hit some big problems some bad people and some simple solutions

how ethics committees and universities have failed us

by now you will i hope share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm but the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients

patients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion because clinical trials almost always require that you have more checkups on your progress more blood tests and more examinations but participants may also expose themselves to more risk or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment people do this out of altruism on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn’t and so will help other patients in the future in fact this understanding isn’t just implicit in many trials it’s explicit because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions if this isn’t true and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company then the patients have been actively lied to that is very bad news

so what are the formal arrangements between patients researchers and sponsors in any sensible world we’d expect universal contracts making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results and that industry sponsors – which have a huge interest in positive results – must have no control over the data but despite everything we know about industryfunded research being systematically biased this does not happen in fact quite the opposite is true it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industryfunded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted without the permission of the funder this is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business as we shall now see

in 2006 a paper was published in jama describing how common it was for researchers doing industryfunded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results47 the study was conducted by the nordic cochrane centre and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in copenhagen and frederiksberg if you’re wondering why these two cities were chosen it was simply a matter of practicality and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world the researchers applied elsewhere without success and were specifically refused access to data in the uk48 these trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry 98 per cent and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the nowfamiliar line between frightening and absurd

for sixteen of the fortyfour trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time for any reason this means that a company can see if a trial is going against it and can interfere as it progresses as we will see later early stopping breaking protocols pp186 202 this distorts a trial’s results with unnecessary and hidden biases for example if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit or bury a worsening negative result crucially the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn’t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject – by design – to such an important flaw

even if the study was allowed to finish the data could still be suppressed there were constraints on publication rights in forty of the fortyfour trials and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright what about the patients you might say or needed to approve the final publication or both none of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers and in fact none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial or the final say on whether to publish

it’s worth taking a moment to think about what this means the results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result or trials that do produce a negative result can be deleted from the academic record but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed

the paper i’ve just described was published in jama one of the biggest medical journals in the world shortly afterwards a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the bmj49 lif the danish pharmaceutical industry association responded to the paper by announcing in the journal of the danish medical association that it was ‘both shaken and enraged about the criticism that could not be recognised’ it demanded an investigation of the scientists though it failed to say by whom or of what then lif wrote to the danish committee on scientific dishonesty accusing the cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct we can’t see the letter but the cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious – they were accused of deliberately distorting the data – but vague and without documents or evidence to back them up

nonetheless the investigation went on for a year because in academia people like to do things properly and assume that all complaints are made in good faith peter gøtzsche the director of the cochrane centre told the bmj that only lif’s third letter ten months into this process made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee two months later the charges were dismissed the cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong but before they were cleared lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked and to the management organisation running that hospital and sent similar letters to the danish medical association the ministry of health the ministry of science and so on gøtzsche and his colleagues said that they felt ‘intimidated and harassed’ by lif’s behaviour lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed so researching in this area is not easy it’s hard to get funding and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps

even though the problem has been widely recognised attempts to fix it have failed50 the international committee of medical journal editors for example stood up in 2001 insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data and full control over the decision to publish researchers at duke university north carolina then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine they recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia was this imposed no sponsors continue to control the data

half a decade later a major study in the new england journal of medicine investigated whether anything had changed51 administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the us were asked about their contracts to be clear this wasn’t a study of what they did rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public the majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were ‘difficult’ a worrying 62 per cent said it was ok for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential this is a serious problem as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced as we shall see in more detail in chapter 6 half said it was ok for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published once again hindering research a quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript asked about disputes 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year

sometimes disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical aubrey blumsohn was a senior lecturer at sheffield university working on a project funded by procter  gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate52 the aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial led by blumsohn’s head of department professor richard eastell after signing the contracts pg sent over some ‘abstracts’ brief summaries of the findings with blumsohn’s name as first author and some summary results tables that’s great said blumsohn but i’m the researcher here i’d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself the company declined saying that this was not their policy blumsohn stood his ground and the papers were left unpublished then however blumsohn saw that eastell had published another paper with pg stating that all the researchers had ‘had full access to the data and analyses’ he complained knowing this was not true blumsohn was suspended by sheffield university which offered him a gagging clause and £145000 and he was eventually forced out of his job eastell meanwhile was censured by the general medical council but only after a staggering delay of several years and he remains in post

so contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common and they’re bad news but that’s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works they also break another vitally important contract the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials

people participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future this isn’t just speculation one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a ‘major’ or ‘moderate’ contribution to society and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution53 patients are not stupid or naïve to believe this because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials but they are mistaken because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished and withheld from doctors and patients these signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points firstly they fail to tell the truth that the person conducting the trial or the person paying for it may decide not to publish the results depending on how they look at the end of the study and worse than that they also explicitly state a falsehood researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future even though the researchers know that in many cases those results will never be published

there is only one conclusion that we can draw from this consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials this is an extraordinary state of affairs made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment despite all this regulatory theatre which hinders good research on routine practice as we shall see – p232 we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine the deceit of these consent forms is to me a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become but it also finally poses a serious problem for the future of research

we desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society because trial recruitment is in crisis and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all in one recent study a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target and more than half had to be awarded an extension54 if word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific recruitment will become even more difficult the answer is not to hide this problem but rather to fix it

so universities and ethics committees may have failed us but there is one group of people we might expect to step up to try to show some leadership on missing trial data these are the medical and academic professional bodies the royal colleges of general practice surgery and physicians the general medical council the british medical association the pharmacists’ organisations the bodies representing each subspecialty of academia the respiratory physiologists the pharmacologists the academy of medical sciences and so on

these organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine in their codes of conduct their aspirations and in some cases their rules since some have the ability to impose sanctions and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards we have established i hope beyond any doubt that nonpublication of trials in humans is research misconduct that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world have these organisations used their powers stood up and announced prominently and fiercely that this must stop and that they will take action

one has the faculty of pharmaceutical medicine a small organisation of doctors – largely working in the industry – with 1400 members and none of the others have bothered

not one

what can be done

there are several simple solutions to these problems which fall into three categories there is no argument against any of the following suggestions that i am aware of the issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry their failure to act harms patients every day

gagging clauses

if there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses – if companies and legislators and academics and university contracts departments all believe that they are acceptable – then everything should be out in the open prominently flagged up so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree

   1 until they can be eradicated where gagging clauses exist      patients should be told at the time they are invited to      participate in a trial that the company sponsoring it is allowed      to hide the results if it doesn’t like them the consent form      should also explain clearly that withholding negative results      will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the      effectiveness of the treatment being trialled and so exposed      to unnecessary harm trial participants can then decide for      themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable

   2 wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right      to gag publication even if it doesn’t exercise that right the      fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly      in the academic paper in the trial protocol and in the publicly      available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial      starts readers of the trial findings can then decide for      themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to      publish all negative findings and interpret any reported      positive findings in that light

   3 all university contracts should follow the same boilerplate      format and forbid gagging clauses failing that all universities      should be forced to prominently declare which contracts      with gagging clauses they have permitted and to publish those      clauses online for all to see so that all can be alerted that the      institution is producing systematically biased research and      discount any findings from them accordingly

   4 in legislation gagging clauses should be made illegal with no      possibility of quibbles if there is a dispute about analysis or      interpretation between the people running the trial and the      people paying for it it should take place in the published      academic literature or some other public forum not in secret

professional bodies

   1 all professional bodies should take a clear stand on      unpublished trial data declare it clearly as research      misconduct and state that it will be handled like any other      form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms      patientsthat they have not done so is a stain on the reputation      of these organisations and on their senior members

   2 all research staff involved in any trial on humans should be      regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is      published in full within one year of completion

   3all those responsible for withholding trial data should have      their names prominently posted in a single database so      that others can be made aware of the risk of working with      them or allowing them access to patients for research in      future

ethics committees

   1no person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a      research project they are responsible for is currently      withholding trial data from publication more than one year      after completion where any researcher on a project has a      previous track record of delayed publication of trial data the      ethics committee should be notified and this should be taken      into account as with any researcher guilty of research      misconduct

   2no trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of      publication within one year of completion

how regulators and journals have failed us

so far we’ve established that ethics committees universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias even though the selective nonpublication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine we know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers doctors and patients make and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death this is not seriously disputed so you might reasonably imagine that governments regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it

they have tried and failed worse than simply failing they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as ‘fake fixes’ we have seen small changes in regulations and practices announced with great fanfare but then either ignored or bypassed this has given false reassurance to doctors academics and the public that the problem has been fixed what follows is the story of these fake fixes

registers

the earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials if people are compelled to publish their protocol in full before they start work then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they’ve published the trials that they’ve conducted this is very useful for a number of reasons a trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial how many patients they’ll recruit where they’ll come from how they’ll be divided up what treatment each group will get and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful because of this it can be used to check whether a trial was published but also whether its methods were distorted along the way in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated as described in chapter 4

the first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 198655 and it was followed by a flood in 1990 iain chalmers we can call him sir iain chalmers if you likefn2 published a classic paper called ‘underreporting research is scientific misconduct’57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the uk58 in 1992 as the cochrane collaboration began to gather influence representatives of the association of the british pharmaceutical industry abpi asked to meet chalmers59 after explaining the work of cochrane and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug he explained very clearly to them how biased underreporting of results harms patients

the industry’s representatives were moved and soon they took action mike wallace the chief executive of schering and a member of that abpi delegation agreed with chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with cochrane this was not a popular move and he was reprimanded by colleagues in particular those from other companies

but then glaxowellcome followed suit and in 1998 its chief executive richard sykes wrote an editorial in the bmj called ‘being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes’60 ‘programmes’ was the crucial word because as we’ve seen and as we shall see in greater detail later you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug

glaxowellcome set up a clinical trials registry and elizabeth wager the head of the company’s medical writers group pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research the abpi seeing individual companies take the lead saw the writing on the wall it decided to commend glaxowellcome’s policy to the whole industry and launched this initiative at a press conference where chalmers – a strong critic – sat on the same side of the table as the industry astrazeneca aventis msd novartis roche schering healthcare and wyeth began registering some of their trials – only the ones involving uk patients and retrospectively – but there was movement at last

at the same time there was movement in america the 1997 fda modernization act created clinicaltrialsgov a register run by the us government national institutes of health this legislation required that trials should be registered but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market and even then only if it was for a serious or lifethreatening disease the register opened in 1998 and the website clinicaltrialsgov went online in 2000 the entry criteria were widened in 2004

but soon it all began to fall apart glaxowellcome merged with smithkline beecham to become glaxosmithkline gsk and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register iain chalmers wrote to jeanpaul garnier the chief executive of the new company to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency but no reply ever came the registry website was closed and the contents were lost though gsk was later forced to open a new register as part of a settlement with the us government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later elizabeth wager the author of the good publication practice guidelines for drug companies was out of a job as her writing department at gsk was closed her guidelines were ignored61

from the moment that these registries were first suggested and then opened it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record and then not publishing your study would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing but the first problem for the us register which could have been used universally was that people simply chose not to use it the regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn’t have to

in 2004 the international committee of medical journal editors icmje – a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world – published a policy statement announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005 unless they had been properly registered before they began62 they did this essentially to force the hand of the industry and researchers if a trial has a positive result then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find although they had no legal force the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most the chance of a major journal publication by insisting on preregistration they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials everyone rejoiced the problem had been fixed

if you think it seems odd – and perhaps unrealistic – that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a 700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors with no legislative power then you’d be right although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past in reality it was continuing just as before because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises later pp247 307 we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue but first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005

in 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals every one of which was a member of the icmje after the deadline for preregistration out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these highimpact academic journals only half were adequately registered before the trial with the main outcome measure properly specified and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter63 the icmje editors had simply failed to keep their word

meanwhile in europe there were some very bizarre developments with enormous fanfare the european medicines agency created a registry of trials called eudract eu legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in europe and many companies will tell you that they’ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so but the contents of this eu register have been kept entirely secret i can tell you that it contains around 30000 trials since that figure is in the public domain but that is literally all i know and all anyone can know despite eu legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register it remains closed this creates an almost laughable paradox the eu clinical trials register is a transparency tool held entirely in secret since march 2011 after heavy media criticism from me at any rate a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called eudrapharm as of summer 2012 although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all at least 10000 trials are still missing and the search engine doesn’t work properly64 it’s absolutely one of the strangest things i’ve ever seen and nobody other than the eu even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register i certainly don’t i doubt you do and both the icmje and the world health organization have explicitly stated that eudract is not a meaningful register

but new work was being done in the us and it seemed sensible in 2007 the fda amendment act was passed this is much tighter it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device at any stage of development other than ‘firstinman’ tests if they have any site in the us or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market it also imposes a startling new requirement all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrialsgov in abbreviated summary tables within one year of completion for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007

once again to great fanfare everyone believed that the problem had been fixed but it hasn’t been for two very important reasons

firstly unfortunately despite the undoubted goodwill requiring the publication of all trials starting from ‘now’ does absolutely nothing for medicine today there is no imaginable clinic anywhere in the world at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years using only drugs that came to market since 2008 in fact quite the opposite is true the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten twenty or thirty years and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the ‘golden era’ of pharmaceutical research when all the most widely used drugs for all the most common diseases were developed perhaps they were the ‘lowlying fruit’ plucked from the research tree but in any case these are the tablets we use

and crucially it is for these drugs – the ones we actually use – that we need the evidence from trials completed in 2005 or 1995 these are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind misled by a biased sample of trials selectively published with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills i am told of cheshire

but there is a second more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt they have been widely ignored a study published in january 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results65 perhaps this is not surprising the fine for noncompliance is 10000 a day which sounds spectacular until you realise that it’s only 35 million a year which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in 4 billion a year and what’s more no such fine has ever been levied throughout the entire history of the legislation

so that in total is why i regard the icmje the fda and the eu’s claims to have addressed this problem as ‘fake fixes’ in fact they have done worse than fail they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed false reassurance that it has gone away and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball for half a decade now people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday’s problem discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s and swiftly fixed

but the problem of missing data has not gone away and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be in the very present day

what can be done

the icmje should keep its promises the eu should be less risible and the fda amendment act 2007 should be muscularly enforced but there are many more disappointments to come so i will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter

blood from a stone trying to get data from regulators

so far we’ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data since it harms patients in large numbers around the world we have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results despite the public pretence to the contrary and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials we have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand we have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication despite their stated aim of protecting patients and we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions66

while the published academic record is hopelessly distorted you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials the regulators which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process must surely have obligations to protect patients’ safety but this sadly is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us

in this section we will see three key failures firstly the regulators may not have the information in the first place secondly the way in which they ‘share’ summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby and finally if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided – the longform documents where the bodies are often buried – then regulators present bizarre barriers blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful nothing of what i am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring

one information is withheld from regulators

paroxetine is a commonly used antidepressant from the class of drugs known as ‘selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors’ or ssris you will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure we will see that gsk withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant and even withheld data about its harmful side effects but most importantly we will see that what it did was all entirely legal

to understand why we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions for any specific use of any drug in any specific disease you need a separate marketing authorisation so a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer for example but not breast cancer that doesn’t mean the drug doesn’t work in breast cancer there might well be some evidence that it’s great for treating that disease too but maybe the company hasn’t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer if they want because the drug is available for prescription and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out even though strictly speaking it’s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer in this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally but ‘offlabel’

this is fairly common as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be timeconsuming and expensive if doctors know that there’s a drug which has been shown in goodquality trials to help treat a disease it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it just because the company hasn’t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use i’ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later but for now what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults

this makes sense in many cases because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults so the risks and benefits might be very different and research needs to be done in children separately but this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business requiring lots of paperwork and some specific studies often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children because that market is usually much smaller

but once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing as we have seen it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything so it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch or a judgement that it should at least do no harm or studies that suggest benefit in children but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids or even good studies but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can’t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children

regulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children ‘offlabel’ without adequate research so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research and formally seek these licences the incentives are patent extensions and these can be lucrative all drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market and become like paracetamol which anyone can make very cheaply if a company is given a sixmonth extension on a drug for all uses then it can make a lot more money from that medicine this seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already even without a licence or good evidence simply because there are no other options meanwhile six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative if its adult market is large enough

there’s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers for example since the fda started offering this deal about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences but many of them were for diseases that aren’t very common in children like stomach ulcers or arthritis there have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children such as more modern medicines called ‘largemolecule biologics’ but there it is

when gsk applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine an extraordinary situation came to light triggering the longest investigation in the history of uk drugs regulation this investigation was published in 2008 and examined whether gsk should face criminal charges67 it turned out that what the company had done – withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see – was plainly unethical and put children around the world at risk but our laws are so weak that gsk could not be charged with any crime

between 1994 and 2002 gsk conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children68 the first two failed to show any benefit but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the ‘drug label’ that is sent to all doctors and patients in fact after these trials were completed an internal company management document stated ‘it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine’ in the year after this secret internal memo 32000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the uk alone so while the company knew the drug didn’t work in children it was in no hurry to tell doctors that despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it more trials were conducted over the coming years – nine in total – and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children

it gets much worse than that these children weren’t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them they were also being exposed to side effects this should be selfevident since any effective treatment will have some side effects and doctors factor this in alongside the benefits which in this case were nonexistent but nobody knew how bad these side effects were because the company didn’t tell doctors or patients or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials this was because of a loophole on which more in a couple of pages’ time you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation because the use of paroxetine in children was ‘offlabel’ gsk had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found

people had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway as a result of their depression there are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves just because of the depression slowly lifting

furthermore suicide is a mercifully rare event which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk also suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful so the signal you are trying to detect in the data – suicide – is going to be corrupted suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don’t result in death are more common than suicide itself so they should be easier to detect but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data because they’re often not presented to doctors and where they are they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways if they appear at all because of all these difficulties you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children and you would want a lot of experienced people with a wide range of skills all looking at the data and discussing it

in february 2003 gsk spontaneously sent the mhra a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverseevent data in trials the company had held going back a decade this analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide but it was misleading although it was unclear at the time data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults which had vastly greater numbers of participants as a result any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away

later in 2003 gsk had a meeting with the mhra to discuss another issue involving paroxetine at the end of this meeting the gsk representatives gave out a briefing document explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children they mentioned while handing out the document that the mhra might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine compared with those on dummy placebo pills

this was vitally important sideeffect data being presented after an astonishing delay casually through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel gsk knew that the drug was being prescribed in children and it knew that there were safety concerns in children but it had chosen not to reveal that information when it did share the data it didn’t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application although the data was given to completely the wrong team the mhra staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem a flurry of activity followed analyses were done and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen

how is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective but actively dangerous there are two sets of problems here firstly access for regulators and secondly access for doctors

there is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes and it’s dismal to see how gsk cheerfully exploited them as i’ve mentioned the company had no legal duty to give over the information because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine’s formally licensed uses – even though gsk knew this was widespread in fact of the nine studies the company conducted only one had its results reported to the mhra because that was the only one conducted in the uk

after this episode the mhra and the eu changed some of their regulations though not adequately and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation closing the paroxetine loophole

this whole incident illustrates a key problem and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book you need all of the data in order to see what’s happening with a drug’s benefits and risks some of the trials that gsk conducted were published in part but that is obviously not enough we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data we are misled but we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data safety signals are often weak subtle and difficult to detect suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children – even those with depression even those on paroxetine – so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise in the case of paroxetine the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together

that leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system the results of these trials – the safety data and the effectiveness data – are given in secret to the regulator which then sits and quietly makes a decision this is a huge problem because you need many eyes on these difficult problems i don’t think that the people who work in the mhra are bad or incompetent i know a lot of them and they are smart good people but we shouldn’t trust them to analyse this data alone in the same way that we shouldn’t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone with nobody looking over its shoulder checking the working providing competition offering helpful criticism speeding it up and so on

this is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done and how the output of a regulator is often simply a crude brief summary almost a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ about side effects this is the opposite of science which is only reliable because everyone shows their working explains how they know that something is effective or safe shares their methods and their results and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data

yet for the safety and efficacy of drugs one of the most important of all analyses done by science we turn our back on this process completely we allow it to happen behind closed doors because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators so the most important job in evidencebased medicine and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds is carried out alone and in secret

this perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators nice the uk’s national institute for health and clinical excellence is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most costeffective and which work best when it does this it’s in the same boat as you or me it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug if a company doesn’t want to release it even though the regulators have all of that data for ‘single technology appraisals’ on one treatment they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant for ‘guidelines’ on treatment in a whole area of medicine they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals as a result even nice can end up working on distorted edited biased samples of the data

sometimes nice is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies this is information that doctors and patients aren’t allowed to see despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs or are actually taking them but when nice does get information in this way it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality leading to some very bizarre documents being published on the opposite page for example is the nice document discussing whether it’s a good idea to have lucentis an extremely expensive drug costing well over £1000 per treatment that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration

as you can see the nice document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles in case any doctor or patient should see it absurdly even the names of some trials are missing preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence or cross referencing information about them most disturbing of all as you can see in the last bullet point the data on adverse events is also censored i’m reproducing the whole page here because i worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe this level of censorship isn’t an everyday phenomenon but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept in professional documents that most people wouldn’t bother to read69

why shouldn’t we all – doctors patients and nice – have access to the information on trials that regulators see this is something i asked both kent woods from the mhra and hans georg eichler medical director of the european medicines agency in 2010 both separately gave me the same answer people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information because they might misinterpret it either deliberately or through incompetence both separately – though i guess they must chat at parties – raised the mmr vaccine scare as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence creating dangerous publichealth problems along the way what if they released raw safety data and people who don’t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns and created scares that put patients off taking lifesaving medication

i accept that this is a risk but i also believe their priorities are wrong i think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators’ websites in summary form

we shall now see that this is untrue

two regulators make it hard to access the data they do have

when exposed to criticism drug companies often become indignant and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed ‘we give everything to the regulator’ they say ‘and you can get it from them’ similarly regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website and you will easily find all the data you need in reality there is a messy game in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed

firstly as we’ve already seen regulators don’t have all the trials and they don’t share all the ones that they do summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug even where the regulator has been given safety data for offlabel uses following the paroxetine case above the information from these trials still isn’t made publicly available through the regulator it simply sits quietly in the regulator’s files

for example duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use which is usually given as an antidepressant during a trial on its use for a completely different purpose – treating incontinence – there were apparently several suicides70 this is important and interesting information and the fda holds the relevant data it conducted a review on this issue and came to a view on whether the risk was significant but you cannot see any of that on the fda website because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence71 the trial data was only used by the fda to inform its internal ruminations this is an everyday situation

but even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky the search functions on the fda website are essentially broken while the content is haphazard and badly organised with lots missing and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design once again – partly here through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence – it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need drug companies and regulators deny this they say that if you search their websites everything is there so let’s walk briefly through the process in all its infuriating glory the case i will use was published three years ago in jama as a useful illustration of how broken the fda site has become72 replicating it today in 2012 nothing has changed

so let’s say we want to find the results from all the trials the fda has on a drug called pregabalin in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease a condition called ‘diabetic peripheral neuropathy’ you want the fda review on this specific use which is the pdf document containing all the trials in one big bundle but if you search for ‘pregabalin review’ say on the fda website you get over a hundred documents none of them is clearly named and not one of them is the fda review document on pregabalin if you type in the fda application number – the unique identifier for the fda document you’re looking for – the fda website comes up with nothing at all

if you’re lucky or wise you’ll get dropped at the drugsfda page typing ‘pregabalin’ there brings up three ‘fda applications’ why three because there are three different documents each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat the fda site doesn’t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for so you have to use trial and error to try to find out that’s not as easy as it sounds i have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me it’s almost four hundred pages long but it doesn’t tell you that it’s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here there’s no executive summary at the beginning – in fact there’s no title page no contents page no hint of what the document is even about and it skips randomly from one subdocument to another all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file

if you’re a nerd you might think these files are electronic they’re pdfs a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document it’s easy you just use the ‘find’ command type in say ‘peripheral neuropathy’ and your computer will find the phrase straight off but no unlike almost any other serious government document in the world the pdfs from the fda are a series of photographs of pages of text rather than the text itself this means you cannot search for a phrase instead you have to go through it searching for that phrase laboriously by eye

i could go on i will there’s some kind of ‘table of contents’ on the seventeenth page but it gets the page numbers wrong i’ve finished now there is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos these problems aren’t caused by technical issues specific to trials and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix this is plainly simply unhelpful and the best we can hope is that it’s driven by thoughtlessness

that’s a tragedy because if you can unearth this document and decode it you will find that it is full of terrifying gems perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study in such a way that it is predestined – from the outset – to exaggerate the benefits of the drug

for example in the five trials on pregabalin and pain lots of people dropped out during the study period this is common in medical trials as you will shortly see and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful or have had bad side effects during these trials you’re measuring pain at regular intervals but if some people drop out you’re left with an important question what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results we know after all that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug

pfizer decided to use a method called ‘last observation carried forward’ which means what you’d expect you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug from just before they dropped out and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed after they stopped coming to followup appointments

the fda disapproved of this it pointed out quite correctly that pfizer’s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is for a fairer picture we have to assume that the dropouts stopped taking the drug because of side effects so their pain score should reflect the reality which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use the correct level of pain to record for them is therefore their pain at the beginning of the study before they had any kind of treatment if you’re interested this is called ‘baseline observation carried forward’ the analysis was duly redone properly and a more modest more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced in this case it turns out that using the ‘last observation’ method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter

here’s the catch four out of five of these trials were then published in the peerreviewed academic literature the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not one trial wasn’t published at all every single one of the published analyses used ‘last observation carried forward’ the dodgy method the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug not one of them acknowledges that ‘last observation’ is a technique that overstates these benefits

you can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial not only are some whole trials withheld from us but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used the devil is in the detail and there are many dodgy trials as we shall soon see with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators furthermore as we shall also see very shortly there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators’ summary documents and what actually happened in the trial

this is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial something called the clinical study report csr these are long pieces of work sometimes thousands of pages but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried drug companies give this study report to the regulator – though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug – so both have a copy and both should be happy to hand it over

we will now see what happens when you ask them

three regulators withhold study reports that they do have

in 2007 researchers from the nordic cochrane centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs orlistat and rimonabant a systematic review as you know is the goldstandard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective these are lifesaving because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment including its side effects but doing this requires access to all of the evidence if some is missing especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain we will be left with a distorted picture

the researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete because negative trials are routinely left unpublished but they also knew that the european medicines agency ema would have much of this information since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients they applied to the ema for the protocols and the study reports that was in june 2007

in august the ema responded it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies the researchers replied immediately almost by return of post there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone’s commercial interests they explained but if there was could the ema please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients

we should pause for just one moment and think about what the ema is doing here it is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of europe with the aim of protecting the public doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data the ema has that data but has decided that the drug companies’ interests are more important having spoken to a lot of people in regulation i can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking regulators in my experience are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market and that this is enough doctors and patients don’t need to see the data because the regulator has done all that work

this misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors contrary to what some regulators seem to think a drug is not either ‘good’ and therefore on the market or ‘bad’ and therefore off it a regulator makes a decision about whether it’s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use at all ever – even if only in some very obscure circumstance infrequently and cautiously this bar is set pretty low as we shall see and lots of drugs that are on the market in fact the overwhelming majority are hardly ever used

a doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now the simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn’t mean it’s particularly good or the best in fact there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug so you want to try another from a different class of drugs maybe the patient has mild kidney failure so you don’t want to use the most popular drug as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys maybe you need a drug that won’t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking

these complex considerations are the reason we are ok with having a range of drugs on the market even if some of them are less useful overall they might be useful in specific circumstances but we need to be able to see all of the information about them in order to make these decisions it is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do

in september 2007 the ema confirmed to the cochrane researchers that it wasn’t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation a serious problem had emerged these weightloss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout europe but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked how bad the side effects were which was more effective or any of a whole host of other important questions real patients were being exposed to potential harm in everyday prescribing decisions through this lack of information that was enforced by the ema

the researchers went to the european ombudsman with two clear allegations firstly the ema had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data and secondly the ema’s brief dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results other than the data on safety and effectiveness which doctors and patients obviously need to access they didn’t know it at the time but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the ema and would last more than three years

it took four months for the ema to respond and over the next year it simply reiterated its position as far as it was concerned any kind of information the disclosure of which would ‘unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies’ was commercially confidential the study reports it said might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug the researchers responded that this was unlikely but was in any case of marginal importance as part of a much more important and pressing situation ‘as a likely consequence of the ema’s position patients would die unnecessarily and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs’ they regarded the ema’s position as ethically indefensible more than that they said the ema had a clear conflict of interest this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments the ema had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone’s reasonable commercial interests and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients

then almost two years into this process the ema changed tack suddenly it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients this argument hadn’t been raised by the ema before but it’s also not true there may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants’ odd presentations or on possible side effects but these were all in the same appendix and could easily be removed

the eu ombudsman’s conclusions were clear the ema had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information he made a preliminary finding of maladministration after doing that he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the ema but he decided to do so anyway his report is damning the ema had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest and exposed patients to harm the ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs the ema’s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue and it had overestimated the work this would have involved specifically he explained removing any personal data where it did sometimes appear would be easy

the ombudsman told the ema to hand over the data or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn’t amazingly the ema the drugs regulator covering the whole of europe still refused to hand over the documents during this delay people certainly suffered unnecessarily and some possibly also died simply for want of information but the behaviour of the ema then deteriorated even further into the outright surreal any scrap of the company’s thinking about how to run the trial it argued which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans this was true the ema said even though the drugs were already on the market and the information was from final clinical trials at the very end of the commercial drugdevelopment process the researchers responded that this was perverse they knew that withheld data is often negative so if anything any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought

that wasn’t the end of it the ema also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this to me this is – if you can forgive me – a slightly contemptuous attitude especially given what happens in the next paragraph it’s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment then they will make worse decisions exposing patients to unnecessary harm furthermore it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket ‘yes or no’ edict and summary from a regulator this is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant but it’s also true of any drug and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed

then in 2009 one of the two drugs rimonabant was taken off the market on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide this at the same time that the ema was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients

and then the ema suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information

in case it needs reiterating let me remind you that the first trial appears in the bible daniel 112 and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time all trials are essentially identical experiments generic across any field with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago there is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property

this was now a farce the researchers opened all barrels the ema was in breach of the declaration of helsinki the international code of medical ethics which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public the researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data and so did the ema patients would die if the ema continued to withhold data there was nothing of serious commercial value in there the ema’s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate the ema was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain

it was now august 2009 and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public they weren’t alone the french ‘prescribers’ bulletin’ prescrire was trying at the same time to get the ema’s documents on rimonabant it was sent some unhelpful documents including the rather remarkable ‘final assessment report’ from the swedish agency that had handled the drug’s approval much earlier you can read this pdf in full online or rather you can’t on the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like – the document the ema sent to one of france’s most respected journals for doctors73 i think it tells a rather clear story and to add to the insult there are sixty pages of this in total

in the meantime the danish medical authority had handed over fiftysix study reports to cochrane though it still needed more from the ema a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the danish government which had seen no problem with commercial information there was none nor administrative hassle it was minimal nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information which is laughable this was chaos the ema – which you may remember was responsible for eudract the transparency tool that is held in secret – was going out on a very peculiar limb it seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients as we shall see sadly this level of secrecy is its stock in trade

but now we come to the end of this particular road for the ema it handed the full final study reports over to the ombudsman reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial once he had had these documents in his hand his final opinion came swiftly there was no commercial data here there was no confidential patient information here hand it over to the public now the ema at glacial pace agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers doctors and patients who needed it the ombudsman’s final ruling was published at the end of november 201074 the initial complaint was made in june 2007 that is a full three and a half years of fighting obstruction and spurious arguments from the ema during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients

after this precedent had been set things had to shift at the ema it was forced to revise its approach and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy this window has just been shut down in 2013 as you will read in the afterword but even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial the ema often doesn’t hold all the modules of all the reports for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved and it only holds records for the most recent few years which is hopelessly incomplete since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades in fact this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the ombudsman they applied for documents on antidepressants a good place to start since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine what happened next was even more bizarre than the ema’s threeyear battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant

the researchers put in their request to the ema but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries rather than by the ema centrally these local authorisations were then ‘copied’ to all other nations the mhra the uk drugs regulator held the information the researchers wanted so they would have to approach it for a copy the researchers dutifully wrote to the mhra asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine and then waited patiently finally the answer came the mhra explained that it would be happy to hand over this information but there was a problem

the documents had all been shredded75

this was in keeping it explained with the agency’s retention policy which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific historical or political interest and the files didn’t meet those criteria let’s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be the ssri antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data and that should be enough on its own but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter one of them – paroxetine – was involved in an unprecedented fouryearlong investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against gsk that investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the mhra has ever conducted into drug safety in fact it was the largest investigation the mhra has ever conducted of any kind ever quite apart from that these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy but the mhra shredded them all the same feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific historical or political interest76

i can only leave you there

where are we so far

the missing data saga is long and complex and involves patients around the world being put at risk and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent since we are almost at the end of it this is a good moment to gather together what we’ve seen so far

trials are frequently conducted but then left unpublished and so are unavailable to doctors and patients only half of all trials get published and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones this means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give since there is no way to compensate for this missing data we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe

this is research misconduct on a grand international scale the reality of the problem is universally recognised but nobody has bothered to fix it

   ethics committees allow companies and individual      researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more      trials on human participants

   university administrators and ethics committees permit      contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can      control the data

   registers have never been enforced

   academic journals continue to publish trials that were      unregistered despite pretending that they won’t

   regulators have information that would be vital to improve      patient care but are systematically obstructive

   they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the      information that they do have

   and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more      information

   drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don’t      see

   governments have never implemented laws compelling      companies to publish data

   doctors’ and academics’ professional bodies have done nothing

what to do about all this

you will need to wait because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come

trying to get trial data from drug companies the story of tamiflu

governments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called tamiflu in the uk alone we have spent several hundred million pounds – the total figure is not yet clear – and so far we’ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs i’m very sorry if you have the flu because it’s horrid being ill but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours though tamiflu does do this fairly satisfactorily we have spent this money to reduce the rate of ‘complications’ a medical euphemism meaning pneumonia and death

lots of people seem to think tamiflu will do this the us department of health and human services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions the european medicines agency said it would reduce complications the australian drugs regulator said so too roche’s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent77 but what is the evidence that tamiflu really will reduce complications answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the cochrane collaboration which you will remember is the vast and independent nonprofit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year in 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic and an enormous amount of money was being spent on tamiflu because of this the uk and australian governments specifically asked the cochrane acute respiratory infections group to update its earlier reviews on the drug

cochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle because evidence changes over time as new trials are published this should have been a pretty everyday piece of work the previous review in 2008 had found some evidence that tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications but then a japanese paediatrician called keiji hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidencebased medicine should work this wasn’t in a publication or even a letter it was a simple online comment posted underneath the tamiflu review on the cochrane website

you’ve summarised the data from all the trials he explained but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite an industryfunded metaanalysis led by an author called kaiser this ‘the kaiser paper’ summarises the findings of ten earlier trials but from these ten trials only two have ever been published in the scientific literature for the remaining eight your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary industry source that’s not reliable enough

in case it’s not immediately obvious this is science at its best the cochrane review is readily accessible online it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials and then analysed them so any informed reader can pull the review apart and understand where the conclusions came from cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms and crucially these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears tom jefferson is an editor at the cochrane acute respiratory infections group and the lead author on the 2008 review he realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the kaiser data he said so without any defensiveness and then set about getting the information in a straight workpersonlike fashion this began a threeyear battle which is still not resolved but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible

first the cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the kaiser paper asking for more information in reply they were told that this team no longer had the files and that they should contact roche the manufacturer of tamiflu so naturally they wrote to roche and asked for the data

this is where the problems began roche said it would hand over some data but the cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement this was an impossibility for any serious scientist it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency more than this the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues in that it would have required the cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader it included a clause saying that on signing it the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement and more than that they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed roche was demanding a secret contract with secret terms requiring secrecy about trial data in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world jefferson asked for clarification and never received a reply

then in october 2009 the company changed tack they would like to hand the data over they explained but another metaanalysis was being conducted elsewhere roche had given them the study reports so cochrane couldn’t have them this was a simple nonsequitur there is no reason why many groups shouldn’t all work on the same question in fact quite the opposite replication is the cornerstone of good science roche’s excuse made no sense jefferson asked for clarification but never received a reply

one week later unannounced roche sent seven short documents each around a dozen pages long these contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the kaiser metaanalysis this was a start but it didn’t contain anything like enough information for cochrane to assess the benefits or the rate of adverse events or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials

at the same time it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug firstly there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations the fda said there were no benefits on complications while the centers for disease control and prevention in charge of public health in the usa – some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks said it did reduce complications the japanese regulator made no claim for complications but the ema said there was a benefit in a sensible world we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet because all would have access to the same information of course there is also room for occasional reasonable disagreement especially where there are close calls this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug so that they can make their own judgements

meanwhile reflecting these different judgements roche’s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions depending on what the local regulator had said it’s naïve perhaps to expect consistency from a drug company but from this and other stories it’s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory rather than any consistent review of the evidence

in any case now that their interest had been piqued the cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases roche’s global safety database held 2466 neuropsychiatric adverse events of which 562 were classified as ‘serious’ but the fda database for the same period held only 1805 adverse events in total the rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom and where but even allowing for that this was odd

in any case since roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review the cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished kaiser data from their analysis because the details could not be verified in the normal way people cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren’t clear the devil is often in the detail as we shall see in chapter 4 on ‘bad trials’ so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment

this is particularly important with tamiflu because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal and that published accounts were incomplete to say the least on closer examination for example the patients participating were clearly unusual to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients in the published accounts patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough fatigue and so on we don’t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice but when these tests are done – for surveillance purposes – then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with ‘flu’ will actually be infected with the influenza virus and most of the year only one in eight will really have it the rest are sick from something else maybe just a common cold virus

two thirds of the trial participants summarised in the kaiser paper tested positive for flu this is bizarrely high and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated because it is being tested on perfect patients the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus in normal practice which is where the results of these trials will be applied doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with ‘flulike illness’ which is all you can realistically do in a clinic among these real patients many will not actually have the influenza virus this means that in the real world the benefits of tamiflu on flu will be diluted and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don’t actually have flu virus in their systems this in turn means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance in comparison with any benefits that is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal everyday realistic patients if they are not their findings may not be relevant to the real world

so the cochrane review was published without the kaiser data in december 2009 alongside some explanatory material about why the kaiser results had been excluded and a small flurry of activity followed roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online and committed to make full study reports available it still hasn’t done so

what roche posted was incomplete but it began a journey for the cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief published academic papers at the core of every trial is the raw data every single record of blood pressure of every patient the doctors’ notes describing any unusual symptoms investigators’ notes and so on a published academic paper is a short description of the study usually following a set format an introductory background a description of the methods a summary of the important results and then finally a discussion covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design and the implications of the results for clinical practice

a clinical study report or csr is the intermediate document that stands between these two and can be very long sometimes thousands of pages78 anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them they contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically detailed descriptions of adverse events and so on

these documents are split into different sections or ‘modules’ roche has shared only ‘module 1’ for only seven of the ten study reports cochrane has requested these modules are missing vitally important information including the analysis plan the randomisation details the study protocol and the list of deviations from that and so on but even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial

for example looking at the two papers out of ten in the kaiser review which were published one says ‘there were no drugrelated serious adverse events’ and the other doesn’t mention adverse events but in the ‘module 1’ documents on these same two studies there are ten serious adverse events listed of which three are classified as being possibly related to tamiflu79

another published paper describes itself as a trial comparing tamiflu against placebo a placebo is an inert tablet containing no active ingredient that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine but the csr for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule whereas the placebos were grey and ivory the ‘placebo’ tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty80 nobody has any clear idea of why and it’s not even mentioned in the academic paper but it seems that this was not actually an inert dummy pill placebo

simply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject but in the case of tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible for example roche shanghai informed the cochrane group of one large trial ml16369 but roche basel seemed not to know of its existence but by setting out all the trials side by side the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies for example the largest ‘phase 3’ trial – one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market – was never published and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documentsfn3

there were other odd discrepancies why for example was one trial on tamiflu published in 2010 ten years after it was completed82 why did some trials report completely different authors depending on where they were being discussed83 and so on

the chase continued in december 2009 roche had promised ‘full study reports will also be made available on a passwordprotected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses’ this never happened then an odd game began in june 2010 roche said oh we’re sorry we thought you had what you wanted in july it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality you may remember this from the ema saga this was an odd move for most of the important parts of these documents privacy is no issue at all the full trial protocol and the analysis plan are both completed before any single patient is ever touched roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports it simply continued to withhold them

then in august 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions firstly it insisted on seeing the cochrane reviewers’ full analysis plan fine they said and posted the whole protocol online doing so is completely standard practice at cochrane as it should be for any transparent organisation and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin there were few surprises since all cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway roche continued to withhold its study reports including ironically its own protocols the very thing it demanded cochrane should publish and that cochrane had published happily

by now roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year suddenly the company began to raise odd personal concerns it claimed that some cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug and about the company but refused to say who or what or where ‘certain members of cochrane group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors’ it announced ‘are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified’ this is an astonishing state of affairs where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all but still roche refused to hand over the study reports

then it complained that the cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to roche staff i was one of the people copied in on these interactions and i believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do roche’s excuses had become perverse and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports it’s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on roche’s refusal to release the data and this is an important matter of public health both for the individual case of this tamiflu data and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information

then things became even more perverse in january 2011 roche announced that the cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need this was simply untrue in february it insisted that all the studies requested were published meaning academic papers now shown to be misleading on tamiflu then it declared that it would hand over nothing more saying ‘you have all the detail you need to undertake a review’ but this still wasn’t true it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over ‘within a few days’ in december 2009 a year and a half earlier

at the same time the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen it’s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk it said not academics now this claim fails on two important fronts firstly as with many other drugs we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data in january 2012 roche claimed that it ‘has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process’ but the ema never received this information for at least fifteen trials this was because the ema had never requested it

and that brings us on to our final important realisation regulators are not infallible they make outright mistakes and they make decisions which are open to judgement and should be subject to secondguessing and checking by many eyes around the world in the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail behind closed doors but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of ‘many eyes’ perfectly

rosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective84 diabetes is common and more people develop the disease every year sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar and diabetes drugs alongside dietary changes are supposed to fix this although it’s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home we don’t control these figures for their own sake we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of realworld outcomes like heart attack and death both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes

rosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999 and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour in that first year dr john buse from the university of north carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings the drug’s manufacturer gsk made direct contact in an attempt to silence him then moved on to his head of department buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents to cut a long story short after wading through documents for several months in 2007 the us senate committee on finance released a report describing the treatment of dr buse as ‘intimidation’

but we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data in 2003 the uppsala drug monitoring group of the world health organization contacted gsk about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems gsk conducted two internal metaanalyses of its own data on this in 2005 and 2006 these showed that the risk was real but although both gsk and the fda had these results neither made any public statement about them and they were not published until 2008

during this delay vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007 when cardiologist professor steve nissen and colleagues published a landmark metaanalysis this showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk that finding was big potatoes his findings were confirmed in later work and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted all around the world

now my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner because as perverse as it sounds doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort for example a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills and be unable to take them any longer once this has happened it may be worth trying a less effective drug if it is at least better than nothing

the concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors visible only to regulators in fact nissen’s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement in 2004 when gsk was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children the uk conducted an unprecedented fouryearlong investigation as we saw earlier but in the us the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud the settlement of which alongside a significant payout required gsk to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website

professor nissen used the rosiglitazone data when it became available found worrying signs of harm and published this to doctors which is something that the regulators had never done despite having the information years earlier though before doctors got to read it nissen by chance caught gsk discussing a copy of his unpublished paper which it had obtained improperly85

if this information had all been freely available from the start regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions but crucially doctors and patients could have disagreed with them and made informed choices this is why we need wider access to full csrs and all trial reports for all medicines and this is why it is perverse that roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on tamiflu

astonishingly a paper published in april 2012 by regulators from the uk and europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing to a limited extent within limits for some studies with caveats at the appropriate juncture and in the fullness of time86 before feeling any sense of enthusiasm we should remember that this is a cautious utterance wrung out after the dismal fights i have already described that it has not been implemented that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data and that in any case regulators do not have all the trial data anyway but it is an interesting start

their two main objections – if we accept their goodwill at face value – are interesting because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data firstly they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data to this again i say ‘let them’ because these foolish analyses should be conducted and then rubbished in public

when uk hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged the crude figures can be misinterpreted after all because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway so some hospitals might look unusually good or bad simply through the play of chance initially to an extent these fears were realised there were a few shrill unfair stories and people overinterpreted the results now for the most part things have settled down and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading for drug data where there is so much danger from withheld information and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses and so many other academics happy to criticise them releasing the data is the only healthy option

but secondly the ema raises the spectre of patient confidentiality and hidden in this concern is one final prize

so far i have been talking about access to trial reports summaries of patients’ outcomes in trials there is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable – a lengthy medical description of one person’s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial perhaps – these can easily be removed since they appear in a separate part of the document these csrs should undoubtedly without question be publicly available documents and this should be enforced retrospectively going back decades to the dawn of trials

but all trials are ultimately run on individual patients and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study while i would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website – it would be easy for patients to be identifiable from many small features of their histories – it is surprising that patientlevel data is almost never shared with academics

sharing data of individual patients’ outcomes in clinical trials rather than just the final summary result has several significant advantages firstly it’s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices in the vigor trial on the painkiller vioxx for example a bizarre reporting decision was made87 the aim of the study was to compare vioxx against an older cheaper painkiller to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems this was the hope for vioxx and also if it caused more heart attacks this was the fear but the date cutoff for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems this had the result of making the risks look less significant relative to the benefits but it was not declared clearly in the paper resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed if the raw data on patients was shared games like these would be far easier to spot and people might be less likely to play them in the first place

occasionally – with vanishing rarity – researchers are able to obtain raw data and reanalyse studies that have already been conducted and published daniel coyne professor of medicine at washington university was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis after a fouryearlong fight88 the original academic publication on this study ten years earlier had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments and changed the main statistical analysis strategy again a huge source of bias coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol and when he did he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug it was a peculiar outcome as he himself acknowledges ‘as strange as it seems i am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients and i didn’t even participate in the trial’ there is room in my view for a small army of people doing the very same thing reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols

data sharing would also confer other benefits it allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data and to better investigate – for example – whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect it would also allow cautious ‘subgroup analyses’ to see if a drug is particularly useful or particularly useless in particular types of patients

the biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a metaanalysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper let’s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug and another reports survival at seven years to combine these two in a metaanalysis you’d have a problem but if you were doing the metaanalysis with access to individual patient data with treatment details and death dates for all of them you could do a clean combined calculation for threeyear survival

this is exactly the kind of work being done in the area of breast cancer research where a small number of charismatic and forceful scientists just happen to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration the summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration between vast numbers of people and on vast numbers of patients producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients

the process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale here for example is the author list on an academic paper from the lancet in november 2011 it’s reporting an immense definitive and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials the author list is printed in fourpoint font size though i suspect that might go wrong in the ebook edition … because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it i typed each of them in by hand for you

this is what medicine should look like an honest list of all the people involved free access to information and all the data pooled together giving the most accurate information we can manage to inform real decisions and so prevent avoidable suffering and death

we are a very very long way away from there

what can be done

we urgently need to improve access to trial data in addition to the previous suggestions there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information and so improve patient care

   1 the results of all trials conducted on humans must be      made available within one year of completion in summary      table form if academic journal publication has not occurred      this requires the creation of a body that is charged with      publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at      twelve months and primary legislation that is enforced as a      matter of urgency internationally with stiff penalties for      transgression in my view these penalties should include fines      but also prison terms for those who are found to be      responsible for withholding trial data as patients are harmed      by this process

   2all systematic reviews – such as cochrane reviews – that draw      together trial results on any clinical question should also      include a section on the trials which they know have been      conducted but whose results are being withheld this should      state which completed trials have not reported results how      many patients’ worth of information there is in each unreported      trial the names of the organisations and the individuals who      are withholding the data the efforts the reviewers have made      to get the information from them this is trivial extra work as      review teams already attempt to access this kind of data      documenting this will draw attention to the problem and make      it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible      for harming patient care in each area of medicine

   3 all clinical study reports should also be made publicly      available for all the trials that have ever been conducted on      humans this will be cheap as the only costs are in finding one      paper copy scanning it and placing it online perhaps with a      check to remove confidential patient information there is a      vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently      being withheld distorting what we know about treatments in      widespread current use many of these documents will be      sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and      regulators we need legislation compelling the industry to hand      them over our failure to fix this is costing lives

   4 we need to work on new methods for academics to extract      summary information from these documents as they are more      detailed than published academic papers the cochrane group      working on tamiflu have made great progress here learning as      they go and this field will need manuals

   5 we should work towards all triallists having an obligation to      share patientlevel data wherever possible with convenient      online data warehouses89 and streamlined systems      whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for      access in order to conduct pooled analyses and doublecheck      the results reported in published trials

none of this is difficult or impossible some of it is technical for which i apologise the field of missing data is a tragic and strange one we have tolerated the emergence of a culture in medicine where information is routinely withheld and we have blinded ourselves to the unnecessary suffering and death that follows from this the people we should have been able to trust to handle all this behind the scenes – the regulators the politicians the senior academics the patient organisations the professional bodies the universities the ethics committees – have almost all failed us and so i have had to inflict the details on you in the hope that you can bring some pressure to bear yourself

if you have any ideas about how we can fix this and how we can force access to trial data – politically or technically – please write them up post them online and tell me where to find them1embed"
