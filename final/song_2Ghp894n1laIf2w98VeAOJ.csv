were goin back in time
id like to see you try
unpackin thoughts through tunnels in your mind
ill fix you mushroom tea
and cross the restless sea
release yourself to escape reality

prechorus
it doesnt faze you
i need a breakthrough
i only want whats right in front of me
its quite unusual
seekin approval
beggin for it desperately
i said

chorus
how do i make you love me
how do i make you fall for me
how do i make you want me
and make it last eternally
how do i make you love me ooh ah
how do i make you fall for me
how do i make you want me ooh ah
and make it last eternally

i can see the real you girl
you dont have to hide
forget bout what your daddy said
ill teach you how to shine
and all the things you tolerated
made you cold inside
but i can light you up again
like embers of a fire

prechorus
it doesnt faze you
i need a breakthrough
i only want whats right in front of me
its quite unusual
seekin approval
beggin for it desperately
i said

chorus
how do i make you love me make you love me
how do i make you fall for me how do i make you fall
how do i make you want me
and make it last eternally
how do i make you love me ooh ah
how do i make you fall for me
how do i make you want me ooh ah
and make it last eternally25embed"
