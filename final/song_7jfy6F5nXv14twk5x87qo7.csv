i had you in my grasp
twisting your heart in my hands
no future will we last
so i live consumed in my past
his touch on your skin
these sickening thoughts in my head
drowning im sinking
save me its hard to breathe in
im so nauseous im so lost without you

verse
now im fucked up cause the only time i cope is when im drugged up yeah
youre so fucked up got me pacing round in circles feeling worthless yeah
i need someone but nobody here that really give a fuck nah
need you right now but youre gone now
girl you stabbed me in the back and ripped my heart out
nevеr thought id break i didnt want to mention
im frail as shit im caving from deprеssion
playing with love is like a sick obsession
staring at the stars i need a fucking message yeah
i need a fucking message yeah

chorus
i had you in my grasp
twisting your heart in my hands
no future will we last
so i live consumed in my past
his touch on your skin
these sickening thoughts in my head
drowning im sinking
save me its hard to breathe in
im so nauseous im so lost without you
