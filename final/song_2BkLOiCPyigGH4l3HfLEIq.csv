took a drive into the sprawl
to find the house where we used to stay
we couldn’t read the number in the dark
you said “let’s save it for another day”

verse 2
took a drive into the sprawl
to find the places we used to play
it was the loneliest day of my life
you’re talking at me but i’m still far away

verse 3
let’s take a drive through the sprawl
through these towns they built to change
then you said the emotions are dead
it’s no wonder that you feel so estranged

verse 4
the cops shone their lights
on the reflectors of our bikes
said “do you kids know what time it is”
well sir it’s the first time i felt like something is mine
like i have something to give

verse 5
the last defender of the sprawl
said “well where do you kids live”
well sir if you only knew what the answer’s worth
i’ve been searching every corner of the earthsee arcade fire liveget tickets as low as 81you might also like11embed"
