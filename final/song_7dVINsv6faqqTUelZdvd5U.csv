my baby knows me better than i do
funny how a woman has that over a man
i can do anything with her here beside me
leaning on her is where i make my stand

chorus
where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when hes wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

verse 2
my daddy was a wild one when he was younger
everybody told my mama hed be hard to tame
full of himself he said sir to nobody
but you oughta see him come a runnin when mama calls his name

chorus
where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when hes wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

verse 3
a man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
but thats okay cause hes still her hero
steady as a rock her love keeps rolling along

where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when hes wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
