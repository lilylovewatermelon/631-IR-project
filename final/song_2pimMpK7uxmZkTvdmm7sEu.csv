situation number one
its the one thats just begun
but evidently its too late

verse 2
situation number two
its the only chance for you
its controlled by denizens of hate

verse 3
situation number three
its the one that no one sees
its all too often dismissed as fate

verse 4
situation number four
the one that left you wanting more
it tantalized you with its bait
