im walking out in a force ten gale
birds thrown around bullets for hail
the roof is pulling off by its fingernails
your voice is rapping on my windowsill

verse 2
yesterdays headlines blown by the wind
yesterdays people end up scatterbrain there
any fool can easy pick a hole i only wish i could fall in
a moving target in a firing range

outro
somewhere im not
scatterbrain
somewhere im not
scatterbrain
lightning fuse powercut
