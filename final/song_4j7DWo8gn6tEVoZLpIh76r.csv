i think i was better off before this all began
so clearly i can see lately that you dont know who i am
everybody tried to tell me something that i never could believe
stand back it seems so much different than it did in front of me
but i know

chorus
theres no good in lookin back on yesterday
and wondering what could have happened then
you think you can give me what i want
you say you say
i think im better off alone
these days these days

verse 2
why should i put my trust in something that i never could believe
so one day you can find somethin better just to pack your things and leave
loneliness is a friend for the moment but you wont walk out on me
i know

chorus
theres no good in lookin back on yesterday
and wondering what could have happened then
you think you can give me what i want
you say you say
i think im better off alone
these days these days
you might also likeverse 3
im tired and im sick of waiting
maybe ill die alone
cause i cant take another damn day
of waiting here for you to come home to me
yeah yeah baby baby please
tell me why

outro
you think you can give me what i want
you say you say
i think im better off alone
these days these days
you think you can give me what i want
you say you say
i think im better off alone
these days these days1embed"
