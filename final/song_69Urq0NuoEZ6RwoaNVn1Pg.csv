postchorus william
the funk phenomenon we funk you on and on
theres no need to hold your nose cause this funk stinks like a rose

verse 1 taboo
big booty funk toe jam funk
underarm funk like you headlocking a skunk
reaking like diseased athletes feet
the stench didnt come till after this beat
smellin like drawers no weezin no pause
put your hands up on the speakers get smelly ass paws
you knew we was coming before we entered the door
cause you could smell the rhyme when we was walkin down the hall
we bring the funk worse than a wet dog
stinkin like fat ladies shittin out logs
we drop enough shit and keep them toilets clogged
keep the people jumpin like them bullfrogs
the first one who smelt it aint the one who dealt it
black eyed peas keep the scent blind like delta
funky like onions you fryin sure is funky girl you aint lyin
see black eyed peas liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus william  fergie

verse 2 william
yall you funking with the funk family
the nonfabricated factual faculty
we formulating up in a factory
focusing on the energy of fluid flow free
we flawless everything is for free
we flourish and we flaunt our flavor freshly ha
can you believe we flip the frequencies and
freak mcs they leave all frantically but
our intent is all to be friendly
but they fighting when we start the freestyling frenzy
i funk up your flat till your girlfriend beef
filling all anatomy bringing me flattery ha
shell be digging these rhymes phat ease beats
like cellulite lyrics all flappy
we bring the funk to your festivities
if you think something stank then it must be the peas

verse 3 apldeap
cellulite overweight stankin mcs
stench smells so strong its insanitary
cause you can sense me a mile away so chanky
with the jungle funk sound from seringhetti
meaty fat nasty like miss fat bootys tights
gettin dirty like mud fights and dirtbikes
turning these drawers black that used to be white
and we shittin on these tracks that you gonna need to wipe
the odors so contagious that it shows up in your dream
man you could pick me out like food in between
your two front teeth cause you be lacking the streets
we got beefy ass beats that we bumpin in the streets
we salty not sweet like stank boxing feet
sour underarm funk you aint washed in a week
and man we be reakin every day and weekend
we could all bounce to the funk and the season
chorus 2 william
bounce bounce bounce hahahaha
