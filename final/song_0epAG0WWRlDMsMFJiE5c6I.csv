they heard me singing and they told me to stop
quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
these days my life i feel it has no purpose
but late at night the feelings swim to the surface
cause on the surface the city lights shine
theyre calling at me come and find your kind

prechorus
sometimes i wonder if the worlds so small
that we can never get away from the sprawl

chorus
living in the sprawl
dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
and theres no end in sight
i need the darkness someone please cut the lights

verse 2
we rode our bikes to the nearest park
sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
you shield my eyes from the police lights
we run away but we dont know why
black river your city lights shine
theyre screaming at us we dont need your kind

sometimes i wonder if the worlds so small
that we can never get away from the sprawl

chorus
living in the sprawl
dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
and theres no end in sight
i need the darkness someone please cut the lights

verse 3
they heard me singing and they told me to stop
