the general screams
as hes torn out of his dreams
now somethings gone terribly wrong
the enemy looms on the battlefield
but his entire armys gone
the gatekeeper chews down his nails
now hes startin upon the bone
sturdy foundation all flows like blood
and it feels so all alone
i watch him as he fumbles with his bullets and his gun
i lean down to his ear
wrap my hands down around his fear
and i tell him whisper run run run

oh little ones
the fun has just begun
oh little ones
the fun has just begun

long white carpet slung over the clouds
where the angels tight knit form to pass rumblin crowds
feeding coal dust down to the earth
just howlin at the moon
as they cry out for jesus
cause they know
they know hell be here soon

so thats the thing about the state we are in
lookin for jesus in the lostandfound bin
no ones got time
to pick him up
sayin
sometimes babies die man lifes just rough
