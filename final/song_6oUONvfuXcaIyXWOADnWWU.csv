outsmarted

verse 1
i used to be the kid who always got caught
i used to be the one who never let thought
interact one bit with intellectual shit diversity and wit
you used to be the kid who waited in line
for an opportunity to waste away time
trying to be so cool no suspicion no clue

chorus
youve been outsmarted im selling you for scrap
outsmarted im selling you for scrap
outsmarted im selling you for scrap
outsmarted

verse 2
now im the kid who put the shit back in place
and im the one who threw it back in your face
it took a little bit of intellectual shit diversity and wit
now youre the kid who put the l back in lame
and youre the one whos always fitted the frame
still such a fool no suspicion no clue

chorus 2
