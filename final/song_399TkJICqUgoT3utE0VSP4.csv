my homie since knee high
we came up on the south side
where you had to beat the street lights home
we got into some street fights
but the next day we be right back get it all
wherever there was me there was you
and we were like crew
straight to junior high school
then you messed it all up
started pushing up
kissed me on the cheek
and i fell in love

prechorus
shortys a little taller now
into big things hes a baller now
his heart never changed
i can see hes still down
i cant forget him
more than his voice is changing now
all that i see is rearranging now
it just aint the same
catching feelings now
i should tell him
you might also likechorus
ooooh when the the boy next door
dont want to be my homeboy no more
saw something that he never saw before
i think he wants to be my baby baby
been thinking bout him all my life my life
now i see him in a whole new light
something about it feels so right
thats why
i think he wants to be my baby baby

verse 2
every night when we get home
under covers talking on the phone
here comes my mother
its way too late
might get in trouble
my heart cant wait
so much to say
writing til my hand cramps up
4 pages saying im in love
i got more than a crush
cant get you off my mind
can you pick me up baby
im sure ill be fine when i look into your eyes
prechorus
shortys a little taller now
into big things hes a baller now
his heart never changed
i can see hes still down
i cant forget him
more than his voice is changing now
all that i see is rearranging now
it just aint the same
catching feelings now
i should tell him

chorus
ooooh when the the boy next door
dont want to be my homeboy no more
saw something that he never saw before
i think he wants to be my baby baby
been thinking bout him all my life my life
now i see him in a whole new light
something about it feels so right
thats why
i think he wants to be my baby baby

bridge
chocolate covered candy kisses
they keep me reminiscing
all i want is what your giving
nothing like your affection
so in love and youre the reason
theres no more lonely season
lately boy you drive me crazy
think i wanna be your baby
chocolate covered candy kisses
they keep me reminiscing
all i want is what your giving
nothing like your affection
so in love and youre the reason
theres no more lonely season
lately boy you drive me crazy
think i wanna be your baby
