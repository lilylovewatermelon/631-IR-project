i wanna be sober but i love gettin high
wanna give it a hundred percent but im too afraid to try
i wanna be faithful but love hookin up with randos
i wanna live by the law but still think like a vandal
i wanna get exercise but im too lazy to workout
i want all the finer things but dont wanna go to work now
i wanna go outside take my family to the beach
i wake up in the morning first thing i do is look at a screen at a screen

prechorus macklemore
wanna live freely why isnt it so easy
i should read a book but i keep watchin this tv
and i know this lifestyle doesnt really feed me
i just tune out to the voice inside thats speaking

chorus dan caplen
all my little problems keep on buildin up and buildin up
all my good intentions just aint good enough cant find the love
so i smoke until my lungs are full
and drink until i lose my cool
apologys my middle name and one day i will change but
im okay with who i am today
im okay with who i who i am today

verse 2 macklemore
i want world peace but i wanna watch worldstar
i know that i should stay home and still wanna kick it where the girls are
i wanna be a feminist but im still watchin porno
i wanna eat healthy but ima eat this digiornos
we live on social media read other peoples thoughts
tweet about justice but dont show up to the march
i think about the earth and i think about the eco
what am i willin to sacrifice at the expense of my ego

so i smoke until my lungs are full
and drink until i lose my cool

im okay with who i am today
im okay with who i who i am today
im okay with who i am today
