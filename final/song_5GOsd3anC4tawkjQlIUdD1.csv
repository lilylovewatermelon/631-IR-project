twinkle twinkle little star

verse 1
tell me how the cow jumped over the moon
how the little lady lived in a shoe
how jack on the beanstalk climbed to the sky
then i’ll start believing in you

verse 2
tell me how jack horner got a plumb from his thumb
and how humpty dumpty fell
i’m a lot more able to believe in a fable
than all the other stories you tell

verse 3
you got a new fur coat and you told me quote
you won it at a stanley party
stanley must be quite a guy and his parties sure run high
cause the price tag read fourhundred and forty
what party

verse 4
so tell me cinderella did you get your fella
just by losing your shoe
when i’ve got the time to believe in nursery rhymes
then i’ll start believing in you
you might also likeinstrumental

verse 5
you come home the other day from the pta
with your hair a little damp and beaten
now they dont wear bikinis and hand out martinis
down at the school house meeting
so neaten

verse 6
four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
every little verse i know
when i believe there’s truth in old mother goose
then i’ll start believing in you

outro
then i’ll start believing in you
mary had a little lambembed"
