a mans blood runs hot
as high as the temple will go
though we can deny our nature baby
it makes us less in control
theres a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand
with secrets that she only knows
oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes
and its to her that i must go

chorus
because she settles me down
settle me down
oh wont you settle me down
and cool this fever in my blood
oh wont you settle me down
come on

verse 2
oh its not my style
to be afraid
of what evil men going to do
and i wont live in fear
i know why im here
yeah im sheltered and watched after too
because these people put on the fine business suits
and they step on your face until theyre going
oh the money the cursing when its time for the hearse
only bankers and lawyers are showing
