i see myself there waiting by the roadside
laid claim to nothing but a black bag and the attire i stand in
no name no history just a target on my temple
and a hole in my head i couldve been one of kings

verse
the shell of a boy of the man that i used to be
a monkey in a man suit
i stand here as nothing to you
wind me up and watch me go

chorus
lay down your guns cut me from ear to ear
eye for an eye the glass is long gone broken
lay down your guns cut me from ear to ear
eye for an eye the glass is long gone broken

postchorus
i walk this road alone no thanks to you
i walk this road alone no thanks to you no thanks to

bridge
load up your sixshot baby put it to my head
pull the trigger blank id figured put it to me dead
load up your sixshot baby put it to my head
pull the trigger blank id figured put it to me dead
load up your sixshot baby put it to my head
pull the trigger blank id figured put it to me dead
load up your sixshot baby put it to my head
pull the trigger blank id figured put it to me dead
