driving this road down to paradise
letting the sunlight into my eyes
our only plan is to improvise
and its crystal clear that i dont ever want it to end
if i had my way i would never leave
keep building these random memories
turning our days into melodies
but since i cant stay

chorus
ill just keep playing back these fragments of time
everywhere i go these moments will shine
ill just keep playing back these fragments of time
everywhere i go these moments will shine

verse 2
familiar faces ive never seen
living the gold and the silver dream
making me feel like im seventeen
and its crystal clear that i dont ever want it to end
if i had my way i would never leave
keep building these random memories
turning our days into melodies
but since i cant stay
