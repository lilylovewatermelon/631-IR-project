whats your problem
you think that youre a god
you came and fucked my life up when you knew that i was lost
whats your problem
im crying on the floor
you made me hate myself just so that i would love you more

verse 1
i dont give a fuck about you like i used to
back when i really thought i knew you
back when id die not to lose you
yeah you knew i didnt have many friends when i met you
was the new kid trying to impress you
you always loved coming to the rescue

prechorus
i shouldve known when my mom said she dont like you
shouldve took that as a sign
thought i caught you smiling thе night that you saw me cry
i bet it feeds your ego
that im low all thе time
cause that shit gets you high

chorus
whats your problem
you think that youre a god
you came and fucked my life up when you knew that i was lost
whats your problem
im crying on the floor
you made me hate myself just so that i would love you more

its funny you took me round town like you owned me
wanted me for your eyes only never wanted anyone to know me
tried to make me more like you and less like me
youre saying things i wont repeat
thats petty shit only you would do

prechorus
i shouldve known when my mom said she dont like you

thought i caught you smiling the night that you saw me cry
bet it feeds your ego
that im low all the time
cause that shit gets you high
