youve got to get better
i said its all in your head
we could live through these letters
or forget it all together
see the months they dont matter
its the days i cant take
when the hours move to minutes
and im seconds away

chorus adam lazzara
just ask the question come untie the knot
say you wont care
say you wont care
retrace the steps as if we forgot
say you wont care
say you wont care
you try to avoid it but theres not a doubt
and theres one thing i can do nothing about

verse 2 fred mascherino
well all that we need is just a reaction
its too much to ask for when theres no attraction anymore
if chasing our dreams is just a distraction
i want to remember when i know that i cant go back

and theres one thing i can do nothing
theres one thing i can do nothing
theres one thing i can do nothing about
