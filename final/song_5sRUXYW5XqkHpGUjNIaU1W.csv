verse
you can run as far as you can ill still be there
have you ever heard the saying that real is rare
you can look anywhere anywhere
i done looked everywhere everywhere
i kept it so real with you cause i cant fake it baby fake it baby
wear my heart on my sleeve we have deep conversations
come and vibe with me in whatever hotel im stayin
cryin tellin me all of your dreams and your aspirations
its crazy how you got did in your past
i dont do no pillow talkin
but im nothin like yo last
and we fly privately thats a whole nother class
yo pride what made you leave
when you knowin this where its at

chorus
your attitude stuck up
niggas got yo head fucked up
tell me if im lyin do i ever cross your mind
i been this way before i made it baby but but
this twenty million later baby
and by the time you hear this song
im gon be longer than gone
forever in your heart always in your mind
stuck in your thoughts a mountain you cant cross
