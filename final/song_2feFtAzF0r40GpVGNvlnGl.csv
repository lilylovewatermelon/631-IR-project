theres a blind man in the desert
they drank the sand like water
they said so it is it is so they said
the blind man didnt cause he couldnt understand
he understood what he didnt understand
he only understood because he couldnt understand
he wouldnt understand so he wouldnt eat sand

refrain
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand

verse 2
but could he see his folly
the blinds not fooled so easily
he was free
they were not
never saw what he saw
the blind man left when he saw their fault
he couldnt be wrong so he wouldnt last long

refrain
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand
sick men sip sand
