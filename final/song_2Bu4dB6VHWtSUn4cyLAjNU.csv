i found a note with your name and a picture of us
even though it was framed and covered in dust
it’s the map in my mind that sends me on my way
they say it’s never too late to stop being afraid
and there is no one else here so why should i wait
and in the blink of an eye the past begins to fade

prechorus
so have you ever been caught in a sea of despair
and your moment of truth
is the day that you say “i’m not scared”

chorus
put your hands in the air if you hear me out there
i’ve been looking for you day and night
shine a light in the dark let me see where you are
‘cause i’m not gonna leave you behind

postchorus
if i told you that you’re not alone
and i show you this is where you belong
put your hands in the air one more time

verse 2
i’ve seen a million miles met a million faces
took all i knew to reach all these places
and i’d do it again if it brings me back to you

so have you ever been caught in a sea of despair
and your moment of truth
is the day that you say “i’m not scared”

chorus
put your hands in the air if you hear me out there
i’ve been looking for you day and night
shine a light in the dark let me see where you are
