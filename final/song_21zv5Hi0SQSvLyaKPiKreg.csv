you took my clothes off with your hands
i gotta say you look real pretty
all the way from new york city

and the sunlight in your eyes
pins and needles
no surprise
and the moon shines in your hair
can you believe it were really here

and its all handled
you close your eyes and count to ten
dont swallow any seaweed
or if you do youre starting again

you either didnt or you did
talking bout talking from within
talking bout how you wanna live
we call it metamorphosis
yeah this is metamorphosis

and the sunlight in your eyes
pins and needles no surprise
and the moon shines in your hair
can you believe it were really here

oh close your eyes and count to ten
dont swallow any seaweed
