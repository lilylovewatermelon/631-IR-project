out of focus didnt take a second to notice
now were separated by oceans vast
couldnt make this last

prechorus
i wish id have stayed
cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
make your heart unsteady
then it breaks so im prayin that youre feelin the same

chorus
you know i spent some time in hollywood tryin to find
somethin to get the thought of you and i off my mind
so tell me honey oh when youre just a step away from fallin apart
do you ever feel like goin back to the start

verse 2
all the streetlights illuminate what home used to feel like
and when i get to thinkin cant sleep at night
no i dont feel right

prechorus
i wish id have stayed
cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
make your heart unsteady
then it breaks so im prayin that youre feelin the same

if you can hear me does it really have to end
i feel you close although youre eight hours ahead
if we can pick it up just tell me where and when

if we can pick it up just tell me where and when
well go back to the start again
