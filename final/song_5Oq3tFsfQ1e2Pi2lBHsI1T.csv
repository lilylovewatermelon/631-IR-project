everybody wants to be famous
nobody wants to be nameless aimless
people act shameless tryna live like entertainers
want a fat crib with the acres
so they spend money that they ain’t made yet
got a benz on tik that they ain’t paid yet
spend their pay cheque in the west end on the weekend
got no money by the end of the weekend
but they don’t care cause thеir life is a movie
starring louis v paid for by yours truly
truthfully it’s a joke likе a bad episode of hollyoaks
can’t keep up with the cover notes
so they got bad credit livin’ on direct debit in debt
they still don’t get it
cause they too busy livin’ the high life the night life
huggin’ the high when livin’ it large and they all say

chorus florence welch dizzee rascal
sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
and things go wrong no matter what i do thats right
now and then it seems that life is just too much
but you’ve got the love i need to see me through

verse 2 dizzee rascal
check it yo let me take you down to london city
where the attitude’s bad and the weather is–
everybody’s on a paper chase it’s one big rat race
everybodys got a screw face so many twoface
checkin their high just like theyre ready to ride
i’m on the inside looking at the–
so it’s an accurate reflection
city wide north east west and the south side
everywhere i go there’s a goon on the corner
guns and drugs cause the city’s like a sauna
and it’s getting warmer and out of order
tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
mr politician can you tell me the solution
what’s the answer what’s the conclusion
is it an illusion is it a mirage
i see youngens die because they tryna live large
and they all say
you might also likechorus florence welch dizzee rascal
sometimes i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
put your hands up
i know i can count on all of you thats right thats right
sometimes i feel like saying “lord i just don’t care” woah
but you’ve got the love i need to see me through
check it check it come on come on
you got the love who’s got the love
you got the love who’s got the love
you got the love that’s right thats right thats right thats right
you got the love who’s got the love
you got the love who’s got the love
you got the love check it yo

verse 3 dizzee rascal
yo were living in the days of the credit crunch
give me the dough i’m tryna have a bunch
but i cant have rice for lunch
its not there aint enough to share
it aint fair never dreamed that he could be rare
who cares who dares to make a change
everybodys in the club trying to make it rain
but not for famine just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere’s the same
again and again i see the same thing
everybody acting like they their plane sailin’
but i see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
and then a depression in whatever profession
this is my confession i can’t front i’m in the forefront
living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
with no rope but i ain’t tryna see the bottom
because thats where i came from i ain’t forgotten
chorus florence welch dizzee rascal
you got the love who’s got the love
you got the love
you got the love that’s right thats right thats right thats right and again
you got the love cmon cmon
you got the love woahhhh
you got the love woo
who’s got the love whos got the love
whos got the love come on
and again cmon
sometimes i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
i know i can count on all of you
sometimes i feel like saying “lord i just don’t care
but you’ve got the love i need to see me throughembed"
