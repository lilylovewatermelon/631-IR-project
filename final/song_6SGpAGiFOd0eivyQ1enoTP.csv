hello little baby
youre a princess just like me
bet youre thinking maybe
its a pretty cool thing to be
but soon youll see that everyone expects a lot from you
they say that there a princess should and shouldnt do

chorus katie
but you and me
we we know better

2x
1 2 3 together clap together snap together
you and me together knees together freeze together
up or down together princess crowned together
always be together you and me

verse 2 kristen
they say a princess is full of charm and grace
they say she always knows her place
they say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
they say she never laughs and snorts milk out her nose

they say shes calm they say shes kind
they say she never speaks her mind
or freezes nannys big behind
you might also likechorus together
but you and me
we we know betternanny you girls are in so much trouble when i tell your father
anna how come you can do that and i cant
elsa i dont know i wish you could thoughverse 3
they say a princess is super duper sweet
she doesnt fight she doesnt sweat and you never see her eat
they say a princess doesnt climb and scrape her knee
they say a princess wouldnt freeze her tutors tea
they say she poised they say shes fair
she never mentions underwear
or longs to see the world out there

chorus
but you and me
we

bridge
have big ideas of our own
for the distant someday when were grown
when im queen and im your right hand
youll get to travel throughout the land
ill them of my sister and the magic things she can do
well take care of our people
and they will love me and you
outro
no one can tell us what a princess should be
as long as were together you and me1embed"
