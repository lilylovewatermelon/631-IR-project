fall back and touch the night
and reach for the blinding light
cause everybody says that were too young to see
we know that were brave enough to be

chorus
in a state of ecstasy
in the place were meant to be
in a state of ecstasy
there is only you and me

verse 2
break through from the other side
and lead me to paradise
cause nothing but love can take us away from here
every time i close my eyes we disappear

chorus
in a state of ecstasy
in the place were meant to be
in a state of ecstasy
there is only you and me

in a state of ecstasy
in the place were meant to be
in a state of ecstasy
there is only you and me
in a state of ecstasy
in the place were meant to be
in a state of ecstasy
there is only you and me1embed"
