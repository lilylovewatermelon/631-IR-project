they passed me by all of those great romances
you were i felt robbing me of my rightful chances
my picture clear everything seemed so easy

prechorus
and so i dealt you the blow one of us had to go
now its different i want you to know

chorus
one of us is crying one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
one of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking
one of us is lonely one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small
wishing she had never left at all

verse 2
i saw myself as a concealed attraction
i felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
just like a child stubborn and misconceiving

prechorus
thats how i started the show one of us had to go
now ive changed and i want you to know
