to a nigga nature haha
oohhh

verse 1 2pac
no need to cry now go wipe your tears be a woman
why you actin surprised you saw the bullshit comin
fake hair fake nails fake eyes too
so why you bound to fuck with fake guys too
aint nothin hard about it why you lookin sad shoulda though about it
say you learned i truly doubt it
i guess you got a problem with affection kinda loose with the love
gettin freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
ask to buy you a drink you holla dom pérignon
knowin im a cash getter still i remain calm
let you chill with me plus you was smilin til the bill miss me
thats what you get for tryin to dick me
miss me with that buy me this buy me that syndrome shit
bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
gettin mad cause i cursed and i scream i hate ya
introduce you to a nigga nature feel me

im probably too nice at first i let you kiss me where it hurts
me and you gettin busy slingin dick in the dirt
met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
see us toungekissin you was truly with it
little ecstacy hennesey mixed with me
picture me pay for pussy when the dicks for free
hey now where my niggas at tell these hoes
before i pay i jerk off word to moses
visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
pointin pointin to the places that you want me to hit
gimme room all up in the womb call the cops
nigga hittin walls til them bastards drop
label me makaveli thug nigga with pipe
livin life like a rock stars friday night
make money get pussy always keep a pager
cell phone and a ride to complete my nature

verse 3 2pac
haha started as a seed from the semen straight outta papas nuts
lustin for creamin bitches with big butts
curves make a nigga cry tits and shit
when im locked down beggin you for porno flicks
sneak weed in help a nigga pass the time
put my name tattood so that ass is mine
tell everybody pac put it down for good
a local legend through the whole hood follow me
i got a gun on me goin for none on the run baby
you know a nigga need some is my son crazy
why i cry when i be thuggin til i die
picture a nigga in heaven high off weed i fly
got me missin dead homies wishin phonies would die
hit the weed and hope it get me high dear god
understand my ways livin major
blessed with a thugs heart and a real live nigga nature
hook val young  2pac
why cry knowin thats the niggas nature
cause thats a nigga nature
