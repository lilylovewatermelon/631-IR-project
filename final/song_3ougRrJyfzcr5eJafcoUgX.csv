im not doing great
i feel like im dead not thinking straight
inside my body troubled full of hate
i had to let it out before its too late

chorus
deep inside it cant hide
feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me every time
stuck in this place where i cant escape
screaming and clawing from deep inside

verse 2
why wont it fade
outside i had to lie im okay
i hope someday ill stop feeling pain
i guess this is a life i have made

chorus
deep inside it cant hide
feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me every time
stuck in this place where i cant escape
screaming and clawing from deep inside
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
what am i doing
i cant believe this i have been hiding
wanting to be less giving to people
they take from me always theyre bringing drama to me
look
look at me now
now

chorus
feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me every time
stuck in this place where i cant escape
screaming and clawing from deep inside

outro
i cant stand
all this fucking pain
please god just go away
please god just make them pay3embed"
