honor respect valor and nuts
you best to come with all fo when you come up against us
you can scream yell cuss catch a bit of throw tantrum
it dont matter cause a victory you gon hand em
no phantom slabs and 4s
bun and pimps coming through so nigga grab your hoes
trying to sip someing too so nigga pass the purp
we bout to beat your avenue getting cash and work
its been a long time long grind long mash
now its long shine long pine long cash
tapping ash out the cadillac window
while im tapping ass leaning back smoking some endo
aint no need to pretend ho you know what the real
you know who the truth when they in the booth you know who the trill
so fuck how you feel we make you pay by the pound
recognize when you fucking around with that underground
