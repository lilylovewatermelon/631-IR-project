im mastering the art of miracles and flawless tragedies
in here i spend every day in captivity
devoured while the walls grow hands and teeth

verse 1
i cried and listened to the rain in a rental car
one day somebodys gonna go and get pushed too far
but now i dont know what to say
shall i deny my lungs their breathing rights
so give it up give it up dont let your mind slip away
dont drink dont get so high
your beats too obvious
not gonna say what you want me to say i guess youre right
the less youre seen the less you are
but i dont even care anymore

chorus
anatomy of a ghost invisible friend
i wont pay for sanity cause i dont wanna know
some things are better left alone
but thanks for your concern and calls

verse 2
id put a bullet in my head if i ever lost you now
never even owned a bed just a bloodred couch
you think youre getting the best of me disarm this smoke alarm
fuck you no one is gonna ruin all our fun
all that we want is this temporary release and distraction

anatomy of a ghost invisible friend
i wont pay for sanity cause i dont wanna know
some things are better left alone it seems
are you out there
im not everything you wanted me to be
so i suggest you pray for a
a full recovery a full recovery

breakdown
your words were written in
your words were written in
cold blood
yeah

bridge
even with phantom power and ludicrous speed
i cant run because betrayal wont come from my enemies

chorus
anatomy of a ghost invisible friend
i wont pay for sanity so baby heres a toast
to things much better left alone
it seems im not everything you wanted me to be
in a dream on the way to the hospital ill slip away
whats happening to me
outro
and as you drag the lake and pull me out
do you feel the shame inside you
and as my body lays before you now
do you feel my skin is cold3embed"
