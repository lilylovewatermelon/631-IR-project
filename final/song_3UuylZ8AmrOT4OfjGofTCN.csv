i’m sick of picking the pieces
and secondguessing
my reasons why you don’t trust me
why must we do this to one another
we are just passionate lovers
with trouble under the covers
nothing worse than when
you know that it’s over

chorus
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead

postchorus
please don’t leave stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeverse 2
well i’ve got nothing to hide
dip down and come for a ride
embrace a devil so sly
you cannot hear em coming
‘cause my defenses are weak
i have no breath left to speak
so take the evidence
and bury it somewhere

chorus
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead

postchorus
please don’t leave stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
bridge
oh my i don’t mind
being the other guy
nice try for these games
i do not have the time
if you want me call me
come and take a risk
kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

chorus
i just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to say the words i never said
just need a little of your time
a little of your time
to show you that i am not dead

postchorus
please don’t leave stay in bed
touch my body instead
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it
gonna make you feel it
can you still feel it3embed"
