last thing i remember i met the boys down at the
we had a few beers and a few shots
i woke up the next day with cotton mouth and a headache
trying to connect all the dots

staring up at the ceiling i got that funny feeling
looked over and i i saw my exgirlfriend
i felt like a fool and that is when i knew
i have been drinking and dialling again

chorus
so the next time you think ii have had too much to drink
and you tell me i should not drive home
when you take my keys oh i am begging you please
go on take my cell phone

verse 2
because i have been known after
to call up a couple old friends
tell them that i love them or maybe dog cuss them
when i am drinking and dialling again

chorus

verse 3
if you have ever heard me slurring my words
on your voice mail around 400 am
you will have to forgive me and blame it on the whisky
i was drinking and dialling again
ii have been drinking and dialling againsee darius rucker liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeembed"
