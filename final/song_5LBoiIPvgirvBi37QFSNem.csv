verse 1 bun b
site
we growin doja in the basement in that underwater garden okay
with heron in the back shed dryin til it harden
makin hash up in the oven man with yayo on the hot plate
drain and dry in the freezer its obvious we got weight
i said hard work thats soft work even that wet work
builtin clientele so we aint gotta network lets go
we always got work so we aint gotta get work
and if you aint gettin your work from us you bound to get jerked
we yayo experts we been whippin the yola
since them crackas decided to take the coke out cocacola
hold up roll its the king of the trill the underground as well
you can step in the ring when you feel nigga just sound the bell
cant stand the haters in this game but the grind im lovin
pimpin we past all that pushin man its time for shovin
i got the mask i got the strap soon as i find the gloves
then we gon start exposin hoes like farhrenheit 911
you might also likeverse 2 jadakiss
yeah
imma speak clearly cause i dont think they hearin me
a nigga only fear is gettin charged with conspiracy
i can get it right to ya sticky green white to ya
wear whatever you want bullets goin right through ya
if you stressin to get buried
my niggasll send you back to the essence in a hurry
sippin crunk juice blowin dutchies in the chevy
try to figure me out dawg im light but im heavy
yellow lemonheads in the bezzie of the presi
and yeah anybody can rock but dblock rock steady dblock
feds dont need no warrants cause yall all informants
so i get higher than new york insurance
try to keep shit clean like florence
moved on up on the eastside cause i never lost endurance
and its all real niggas if i ever get a license to carry
shit thats a license to kill niggas

verse 3 ti
i refuse to lose i rather give these weak dudes the blues
and separate em from they jewels teach em donts and dos
i raise tools make crews make decisions confused
all spectators can say is this lil niggas a fool
a short fuse with some loose screws some unscrewed
here to prove you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
so who guardin who
you know who to you know what to you know where
goin gainst ems too unfair
cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
now you know i aint no more now than ten folk there
they aint powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
got you runnin for your life without a minute to spare
catch you dead to the right and melt the grease in your hair
when i go to war its gon be an indecent affair
guarantee you nann real nigga breathinll care that at your funeral just your parents and the preacher was there
all on television namedroppin reachin for help
so i aint gotta say a word pimp you beatin yourself
you gon get what you deserve for disrespectin the game
any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
when that other man aint even present
and deny it when somebody ask him about it that niggas a lame you like to
lie on the mic hide behind fame uh
i was a g uh when i came yea and thats the way i remain nigga
verse 4 nas
who is i the egyptianwalker fuckers have a conniption
my existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
i dazzle em like the alderman billy dee in mahogany
minus the perm from the tiniest sperm
that the mightiest the almighty can muster
project prophet chronic blockage gives alzheimers to youngsters
amongst them is me cant remembers my beefs
with who for what they screwface me up
my boo laced me up balenciaga
flimsy condo with bimbos in south of key largo in pimp mode
the inf glow on his clothes and you know its over
hammer hit pin pin hit shell from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
try not to lose me ill try not to lose ya
mamma say mamma sa mu makasa fly to cuba
to chill with some politikill niggas who ill
cause yall niggas are losers dont get comfortable niggas
say hello to mr bad guy get that cash par
im the last don youll ever know so
here you go yall can take these thoughts
anyway im chargin emcees a late fee cost
so when yall done with my style please break me off
but never make nas mad just in case cross
cause ah lately yall dont make me happy
to calm my nerve i need the herb gnc dont carry
verse 5 ice cube
who the fuck is that its ice cube motherfucka
hes a maniac no im a fool motherfucka
old school motherfucka blow through a motherfucka
what you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka
see im ugly and prettay im polished and grittay
shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
see niggas get shittay when i come to their cittay
when i hit the spot that bitch they like — she comin with me
cause i got an ego big as to
but im not an eagle bitch i roll a regal
cause gangstas dont dance we boogie
i told you motherfuckas kobe didnt take that pussy
get money get paid you can beat that shit
even if the da is a piecea shit
colorado got bravado but eat that shit
another white bitch lyin on the black dick
i keep it flippin like flapjacks pimpin like black lacs
give niggas flashbacks they sweaty as ass cracks
when i hit the tarmac it feel like a carjack
niggas get out and vanish like star trek
so fuckin incredible im so fuckin credible
no matter what happen ill never turn federal
and thats my report comin straight from cali
ice cube is the shit on this motherfuckin grand finale4embed"
