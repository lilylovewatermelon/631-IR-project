when the rivers high we jump off the bridge
and when we get home we play some didge

rode the bmx when we walked through the bush
the boys fight to ride it but i just let em push
keith stole an egg from a lil cuckoo
kept it safe in his mouth while he danced jookoo jookoo

verse 7 mia
theres only one ocean that got fish left
one day well have to be a really good chef
and i dont mean us in the bush making meth
boys if you catch meth you catch your death
when i said that keith sneezed and had a chick
broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits
