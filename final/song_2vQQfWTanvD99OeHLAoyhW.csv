well last night these two bouncers
and one of ems alright the other ones a scaryun
his way or no way totalitarian
hes got no time for you looking or breathin
how he dont want you to so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and theres nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realise then that its finally the time
to walk back past tenthousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain youve got somethin to prove
to all the smirkin faces and the boys in black
why cant they be pleasant why cant they have a laugh
hes got his hand in your chest he wants to give you a duff
well secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
its just something to talk about a story to tell yeah

chorus
well im so glad they turned us all away well put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this mornin
got too deep but how deep is too deep

verse 2
well this towns a different town today
said this towns a different town to what it was last night
you couldnt have done that on a sunday
and that girls a different girl today
said that girls a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldnta done that on a sunday
of course not

well im so glad they turned us all away well put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things that i could never think this mornin
got too deep but how deep is too deep

bridge
last night what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it dont make no sense anymore
i said last night what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it dont make no sense anymore oh
