the ride was rough but she was smooth
waiting in the wings just doing her thing
locomoting to the groove

making the scene in a green karmann ghia

just kiss it goodbye on the fly
alibi leave her wondering why
yeah i threw her away and i crave yesterday
now that shes gone now that shes gone she turns me on
she turns me on

verse 2

my savoirfaire got everywhere
it was nothing but a thing if youre wondering
but now she isnt there
