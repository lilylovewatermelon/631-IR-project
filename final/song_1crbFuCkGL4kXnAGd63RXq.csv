it was 100 degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree
whose tears didnt care they just hung in the air
and refused to fall to fall
and i knew id made a horrible call
and now the state line felt like the berlin wall
and there was no doubt about which side i was on mhm

prechorus 1
cause i built you a home in my heart
with rotten wood and it decayed from the start

chorus
cause you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along
no you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along

verse 2
i braved treacherous streets
and kids strung out on homemade speed
and we shared a bed in which i could not sleep at all woohoo woohoo ooh
cause at night the sun in retreat
made the skyline look like crooked teeth
in the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

youre so cute when youre slurring your speech
but theyre closing the bar and they want us to leave

chorus
and you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along
no you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along

bridge
im a war of head versus heart
and its always this way
my head is weak and my heart always speaks
before i know what it will say

guitar solo

chorus
and you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along
no you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along

outro
no you cant find nothing at all
if there was nothing there all along
there were churches theme parks and malls
but there was nothing there all along4embed"
