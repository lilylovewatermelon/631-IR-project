heads burnin wasnt told
to leave the world is burning down
never had no help from anyone im harry harry potter

verse 1
uh let me tell you bout a young nigga he was only fourteen
dont fuck with niggas he stay social distanced like he quarantined
went from nba to torn dreams
and a street legend in between
thats when prayers made him hit his knees
see he was born cabriniera back in 99
on chicago north side where the news reportin live
he cant help but rep his hood damn near born on his block
and his parents had him young they aint really have a lot
seen his daddy gang bangin one day he might take his spot
five years old and he taught him how to aim a glock uh
use that bitch to protect your family thats what he told him
a empty clip he grabbed the gun and practiced what he showed him
and his family hood famous pop out everybody know him
and his people stuck for him so he wont let nobody ho him
uncles tellin street stories shit intriguin like a poem
sayin shit like hed put it to they neck if anybody owe him
all through his childhood he was bad but innocent
playin basketball with his homies runnin scrimmages
this who he cracked jokes made a bond and got suspended with
and when they saw the opps they fistfought to settle differences
til one day the opps they got tired of gettin beat up
they big homies gave em guns like man go and light they street up
they puttin hoodies on all black loadin heat up
adrenaline pumpin now they cant wait until they see us
normal day on the block it was fun and all smiles
but his best friend jacob wandered off from the crowd
took a walk to the store headphones bangin loud
then his opps bent the corner he aint see em come around
when he looked up at the car thats when them shots went baow
blood oozin with his back on the ground
vision blurry heartbeat slowin down
blood comin out his mouth feel like he startin to drown
tires screechin last thing he heard was that sound
jacob just got shot thats what a lady screamed
now everybody out of breath runnin to the scene
seein jacob on the floor that was some shit they couldnt believe
his eyes rolling back his auntie trying to tell him breathe
died fore the paramedics came she cryin baby please
aint even get to graduate cause he was only seventeen
shorty cried all night wishin that shit was just a dream
til that pain turned into anger time to make a nigga bleed

fuck man
this nigga just took my best friend
and i i cant go for that shit
it got me fucked up

verse 2
and by the way his name was terrence but they called him sed
dark skin he wore a mean mug with some long dreads
sixtwo he good at hawkin niggas down he got long legs
now hell go and kill anybody that he want dead
they heard he caught his first body and that word spread
and he know how quick karma come around but he wasnt scared
sacrificed his soul in them streets like illuminati
now sellin drugs and shootin niggas them his only hobbies
big driller now he the one to call and go and catch a homi
got the lo on the nigga who killed his dawg he want his second body
a lightskinned heavyset nigga named rodney
say he be out the west off the xans movin real sloppy

interlude
yo whats the word
man you wont believe who i found out the nigga who killed jacob
it was the lil nigga rodney
he be hangin out up at the gas station on pulaski trying to make some money nigga always out his mind
oh yeah
bet say no more
verse 3
sed pulled up to the lo lights off its like one oclock
grippin on the silver smith  wesson with like thirty shots
he aint gotta put one in the head its already cocked
rodney got his back turned he trying to sell his last rock
sed hopped out the car he ready to erase him
rodney heard him comin he gon run before he let him fade him
its like a demon in him cause his eyes red while he chase him
rodney havin some with regrets now he just hopin god save him
shots to the leg hollow tips ate him
fell to the ground like his shoes he aint lace em
sed walked up stood over him like pussy this for jacob
gave him four shots to the stomach then he faced him
sed runnin to his car rodney bleedin on the pavement
he had untied his hoodie and they seen that on surveillance
tryna match him to the footage the police investigatin
plus they had his picture on the wall at the station
a week later they had came and grabbed him from his mama house
couldnt afford a lawyer in the county fighting drama now
said fuck it takin it to trial he aint coppin out
judge gave him fortynine years now thats a lot to count

outro
now prosecutors were asking for the judge to lock him up for up to twentyfive years
the judge gave him twentyeight
smith had the last word
again he was sentenced to twentyeight years in prison
he has thirty days kelly to appeal that sentence back to you28embed"
