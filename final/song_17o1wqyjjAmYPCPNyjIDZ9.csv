in a little cabaret in a south texas border town
sat a boy and his guitar
and the people came from all around
and all the girls from there to austin
were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock
to take the trip to go and listen
to the little darkhaired boy
that played the tennessee flat top box
and he would play

well he couldnt ride or wrangle
and he never cared to make a dime
but give him his guitar and hed be happy all the time
and all the girls from nine to ninety
were snapping fingers tapping toes
and begging him dont stop
and hypnotized and fascinated
by the little darkhaired boy
that played the tennessee flat top box
and he would play

then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him around
hed vanished like the breeze they forgot him in the little town
but all the girls still dreamed about him
and hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
and then one day on the hit parade
was a little darkhaired boy
that played the tennessee flat top box

and he would playembed"
