well im crazy about fast cars football and guitars
all them old country songs daddy used to play
im crazy about friday nights cold beer and good times
crazy about a summer day out on the lake

but im ten times crazier without about your love girl
id do about anything you ask me to
im just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
but im ten times crazier about you

well im all about a weekend kicking with my good friends
every now and then i like to make a little noise
but dont you go thinking that i wont leave them hanging
cause even though im crazy about them good old boys

but im ten times crazier about you
