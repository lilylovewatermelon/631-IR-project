yeah yo you can change everything right now man you just got to do it you know what im saying its on you you can be the seed you just got to do it

every second that were living were giving another chance to change it all
recall to the plans of your past and youll remain enthralled
contained by walls to destitute for the future chance
if your stance is in the now it allows you to move from root to branch
the truth expands if you act instead of contemplate
why wait for shit to change remain in a cesspool of that constant state
i am awake to the fate that only actionsll make
place no faith in try rather apply to what i will create
procrastinate in a passive state of it cant be done
capitulates to defeat and now youre beat before you even begun
believing becomes a vary essential part of knowing the truth
the youth shows potential but it wont grow if it dont produce
excuse is a mental block to stop us from attaining goals
and holds us back from reaching the stars as far as complaining goes
its so hard but in regards its what gives us our minds
find yourself at the bottom it aint a problem if youre driven to climb
i find my resolve when im faced with the doubts of my soul
i know i may fall but give it my all to crawl out of that hole
theres no walls that i would call impossible obstacles
improbable as it might show it is all psychological
i flow with the methodical possibilities endless
transcendence tranquility hone abilities in a tempest
they say pretentious i say prepare the way for my entrance
evanescence is the moment im tryna own it every second

we exist in the now so dont allow yourself to be chained to sorrow
cargo all that pain and what you gain to help you change tomorrow
no borrowed time we define what the future holds
be bold in the task of blazing the path that you choose to go

exist in the now dont allow yourself to be chained to sorrow
cargo all the pain and what you gain to help you change tomorrow
no borrowed time we define what the future holds
be bold in the task of blazing the path that you choose to go

why wait when the change is now
never bow to your fate you can change the route
dont doubt what you make generate the path
that your craft will make one dayll surpass
every flash in the pan with the lasting flame
to attain that fame from a critical claim
dont chain to a limit no finish in sight
we star chase art imitates life
so ignite every minute that were given a breath
cuz the bests undiminished by the grimace of death
so bless the infinite no pinnacle cap
we rap formidable minimal max
so i sack the citadel literal kings
of the rings centrifugal of ritual swings
so to things difficult mystical maze
tailor made analytical pivotal praise
in an age metaphysical miserable slaves
accolade to pinnacle criminals paid
so fade invisible or picture yourself
in a self made business of riches and wealth
dont shelf what your gift it its due
one day them critics may give it to you
stay true to the finish dont diminish your worth
cuz its worth every cynic and the minutes of hurt
so burst every limit be in it to search
what lurks in the minutes you would quit to desert
so first see the image inside of your mind
to grind three times harder when you start a design
cuz the harder the climb the greater the gain
and if your brain can create it than it may be attained
cuz its a crazy claim that it cant be done
cuz your tongue commands what a man becomes

i was uprooted from a sour patch
now i sit in a paradigm shift and watch time slip from the hourglass
feel fate focusing closing in on its narrow path
like the last of the spartans surrounded on that mountain pass
and i am leonidas screaming try this with a fleet behind us
theres a need for violence when youre freedom fighting
especially against these demon hybrids
scream for silence like a stream of sirens
like we are the team that will seek to find it
these are the beliefs that will free you mind with
dreams are timeless cant redefine it
sleeping giants we are rising to the occasion
a lot different than what i wrote in an old basement
open flames ropes and chains that keep my soul caged in
what they offer to author his soul wont change him
so flagrant lies spoke those agents slice throats
swinging for the fences despite those curve balls that life throws
me and my brother took it further than you might hope
while your internal engine sounds like rookie cards in a bike spoke
thats right coal they make excuses i dont
were ready for hell or high water and neither brought a life boat
but right before i croak i wanna burn an eighth out of a ben frank so i can leave on a high note
cant forget tomorrow thats time ive yet to borrow
it supersedes goals so i treat my soul like precious cargo
wanna barf yo like i ingesting charcoal
we aint people they see us as a wretched collection of bar codes
theres depressing parts i never let it effect my heart though
i use the rhymes of writers guiding light when i tread the dark road
decorate my heart like an impressive art show
existential is saluting the future with his third metacarpal
we better start yo every breath is a clock ticking
every second is death and a step towards not living
yeah the plot thickens
but if youre not willing to get up off your ass and switch the plot then stop bitching
i jot writtens about how it needs to be a lot different
if i misuse this art for fun the bars become a locked prison
truth has gone missing
and im a hop skip and a jump from drop kicking you chumps and punks who forgot to listen
my religion is musical shamanism
quantum physics knowledge wisdom and dollop of solipsism
cant stop my mission
i see through your plots of fiction like an obstetrician with gods cosmic vision
so as the pressure mounts i lead the offensive  that heaven mounts
let righteousness reign a rain to end the drought
and what my mental sprouts will envelope your alleged clout
ill give it every ounce of my heart and ill never doubt
what else would you expect to come out of a rebels mouth
a rebel yell walking out of the depths of hell holding the devils scalp
i spoke to god at the temple mount
he said do not wait treat life like a clock face every second countsembed"
