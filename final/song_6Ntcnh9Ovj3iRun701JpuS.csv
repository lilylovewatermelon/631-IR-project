you hold your truth so purely
and swerve not through the minds of men
this lie is dead
this cup of yours tastes holy
but a brush with the devil can clear your mind
strengthen your spine

chorus
and fingers tap into what you were once
and im worried that i blew my only chance

verse 2
whispers in the dark
steal a kiss and youll break a heart
pick up your clothes and curl your toes
learn your lesson lead me home
spare my sins for the ark i was too slow to depart
im a cad but im not a fraud ive set out to serve the lord
and my heart was colder when youd gone
and i lost my head but found the one that i loved
under this sun
under this sun

chorus
and fingers tap into what you were once
and im worried that i blew my only chance
and fingers tap into what you were once
and im worried that i blew my only chance
you might also likeoutro
and my heart was colder when youd gone
and i lost my head lets live while we are young
while we are young
while we are young
while we are young3embed"
