hold it together
birds of a feather
nothing but lies and crooked wings
i have the answer
spreading the cancer
you are the faith inside me

prechorus
no
dont
leave me to die here
help me survive here
alone
i dont remember
remember

chorus
put me to sleep evil angel
open your wings evil angel

verse 2
im a believer
nothing could be worse
all these imaginary friends
hiding betrayal
driving the nail
hoping to find a savior

leave me to die here
help me survive here
alone

open your wings evil angel
