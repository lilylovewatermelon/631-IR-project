baby ive just been sitting here thinking
how blessed i am to have someone like you in my life
and im so excited so so excited about
being with you for the rest of my life

verse 1
looking at all this land
damn i use to be a lonely man
could never understand
why i had no one to take my hand
but then the weather changed
mother nature brought the sun my way
now girl youre who i am and i am you for the rest of my days

chorus
how the sun comes up in the early morning time
girl i vow to be forever loving you rain or shine
how the moon takes on this so romantic glow
ill be lovin you forever more oh oh yeah

verse 2
now i used to think that i would never have a serious relationship
always praying for that one to come along and give me what i miss
but now those thoughts are no more ever since you came into my life
its like heaven opened up its doors showered down on me the perfect wife oh oh
