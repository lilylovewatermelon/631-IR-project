put your head on my shoulder
hold me in your arms baby
squeeze me oh so tight
show me that you love me too
put your lips next to mine dear
wont you kiss me once baby
just a kiss goodnight maybe
you and i will fall in love

prechorus
some people say that loves a game
a game you just cant win
if theres a way ill find it someday
and then this fool will rush in

chorus
put your head on my shoulder
whisper in my ear baby
words i want to hear
tell me tell me that you love me too
