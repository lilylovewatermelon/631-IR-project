always just coming in here starts the game
why cant this puzzle be solved
each time it happens its always the same
i look down and then start to bawl

and all i see it burns my eyes
burning all inside

chorus
caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over
taking all thats mine one more time

verse 2
always this teasing sometimes i lose faith
where is my strength to hold on
facing existence how can i relate
do i stand clear or move on

and all i see it burns my eyes
burning all inside

chorus
caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over
taking all thats mine one more time
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likecaught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over
taking all thats mine one more time

bridge
falling through this space in time
buried in this hurt of mine
falling slowly like a dream
falling through a world unseen

why can i not break this spell
im in darkness is this hell
falling towards this hole i see
this is how it has to be

chorus
caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over
taking all thats mine one more time

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over
taking all thats mine one more time
outro
one more time
one more time1embed"
