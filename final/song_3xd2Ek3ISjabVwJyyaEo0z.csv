this life is full of choices
hard to make one
all the voices in my head
those blue eyes im in love with
or that highway whichever i pick
therell be regrets
i go one way i lose everything
i go the other way same thing

chorus
im torn and its tearing me apart
i want to go but i dont want to break her heart
like a sword with a double edged blade
its going to cut deep either way
this little town this little town that big old world that big old world
chase the dream or keep the girl

verse 2
more than once i packed it all up break down
but i break down blame it on the truck
just couldnt go just couldnt
just want to be out there making my mark
lay down every night in her arms

chorus
im torn and its tearing me apart
i want to go but i dont want to break her heart
like a sword with a double edged blade
its going to cut deep either way
this little town this little town that big old world that big old world
chase the dream or keep the girl

i dont know why i cant have it all
need to tear down that wall
between this little town that big old world
go chase my dream and keep the girl

chorus
im torn and its tearing me apart
i want to go but i dont want to break her heart
like a sword with a double edged blade
its going to cut deep either way
this little town this little town that big old world that big old world
chase the dream or keep the girl
