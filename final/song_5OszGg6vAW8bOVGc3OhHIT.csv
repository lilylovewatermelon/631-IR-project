ready for love

verse 1
you took a piece of my heart
i never thought that this could fall apart
you said you fell in love
and this was more than i had ever been afraid of
another life
another happy ending it cuts like a knife
another place another time
another hand to touch another sun to shine

chorus
youve got me deeper than deep and im constantly blinded
im running around but theres no place to hide
i start to talk in my sleep our souls are divided
why cant they forgive me these demons inside
deeper than deep and im constantly blinded
my heart starts to shiver for i was letting up
i start to talk in my sleep cause our souls are divided
how can it be that youre ready for love

time will tell
a single day could help me break this spell
dont want to be alone
when will i be understood when is my kingdom to come
another boy another life
another happy ending and ill be alive
another place another time
another hand to touch another sun to shine

chorus
youve got me deeper than deep and im constantly blinded
im running around but theres no place to hide
i start to talk in my sleep our souls are divided
why cant they forgive me these demons inside
deeper than deep and im constantly blinded
my heart starts to shiver for i was letting up
i start to talk in my sleep cause our souls are divided
how can it be that youre ready for love

outro
how can it be that youre ready for love
how can it be that youre ready for loveembed"
