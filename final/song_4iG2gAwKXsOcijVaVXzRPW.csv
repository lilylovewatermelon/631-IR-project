im feelin rough im feelin raw
im in the prime of my life
lets make some music make some money
find some models for wives
ill move to paris shoot some heroin
and fuck with the stars
you man the island and the cocaine
and the elegant cars

prechorus 1
this is our decision to live fast and die young
weve got the vision now lets have some fun
yeah its overwhelming but what else can we do
get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute

chorus
forget about our mothers and our friends
were fated to pretend
to pretend
were fated to pretend
to pretend

verse 2
ill miss the playgrounds
and the animals and diggin up worms
ill miss the comfort of my mother
and the weight of the world
ill miss my sister miss my father
miss my dog and my home
yeah ill miss the boredom and the freedom
and the time spent alone

but there is really nothing nothing we can do
love must be forgotten life can always start up anew
the models will have children well get a divorce
well find some more models everything must run its course

chorus
well choke on our vomit and that will be the end
we were fated to pretend
to pretend
were fated to pretend
to pretend
