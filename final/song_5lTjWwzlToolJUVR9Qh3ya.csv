he was a boy she was a girl
can i make it any more obvious
he was a punk she did ballet
what the fuck does it matter anyway
he didnt try to make her cum
on top of all that he was a little dumb
honestly she was better off alone
now hes breathin down the phone

he was a skater boy
she said see you later boy
he wasnt good enough for her
shes not a therapist
dont wanna take care of him
shes an independent girl ha duh uh

suckin my nuts like he tryna get back in my business
back in my butt woah hed be lucky just to sniff it
