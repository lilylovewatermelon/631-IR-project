you got your tongue pierced once
and you say you got another that you cant show
anyone unless its undercovers
but youre running around
showing everyone your new tattoo
you got an a in class
and you hope no one would notice
youre the smartest kid in school
and it makes you selfconscious
and your loser boyfriend smoking out in the boys room
i wish someone would tell you

chorus
youre a star the way you are
you know youre not fooling anyone
no youve got the eyes of an angel
dont try to change yeah
everybodys got their scars everybodys got their scars
no matter what they tell ya
youre beautiful the way you are

verse 2
and your mom was so happy
you became a cheerleader
homecoming queen just like your older sister
till you dyed your hair pink
and they said what were you drinkin
and it never did sink in
