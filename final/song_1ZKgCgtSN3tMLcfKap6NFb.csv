its the widow now that owns that angry plow
the spartan mule and the crippled cow
the fallow field that will yield no more
as the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor

verse 2
the stream cant contain such the withering rain
and from the pasture the fence it is leaning away
the clouds crack and growl
like some great cat on the prowl
crying out i am i am over and over again

chorus
the days grow short
as the nights grow long
the kettle sings its tortured song
as many petalled kiss i place upon her brow
oh my lady lady i am loving you now

verse 3
the winter birds have come back again
here the sprightly chickadee
gone now is the willow wren
in passing greet each other as if old old friends
and to the voiceless trees
it is their own they will lend
you might also likechorus
the days grow short
as the nights grow long
the kettle sings its tortured song
as many petalled kiss i place upon her brow
oh my lady lady i am loving you now

bridge
and though all these things will change
the memories will remain
as green to gold and gold to brown
the leaves will fall to feed the ground
and in their falling make no sound

oh my lady
lady i am loving you now

verse 5
ive gathered all my money and im goin to town
to buy my lady a long and flowing gown
cause come tomorrow morning
were off to the county fair
ill find a yellow flower
and i will lace it in her hair

chorus
the days grow short
as the nights grow long
the kettle sings its tortured song
as many petalled kiss i place upon her brow
oh my lady lady i am loving you now
oh my lady lady i am loving you nowembed"
