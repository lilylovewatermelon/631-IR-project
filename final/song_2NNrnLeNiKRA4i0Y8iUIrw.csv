i saw her turn her head
in a dropdead gaze
she was peeking out over the top
of those wirerim shades
now it wasnt my charm
and it wasnt my grin
that had that little secretary
dialed right in
she wasnt looking at me man
she was looking at my feet

chorus
its these twentytwo hundred
and twentyfive dollar
pair o handmade genuine fine
hornedback kicks
with a sevenrow stitch
and a three dollar sidewalk shine
yeah theyre made to fit
and theyre hard to find
make a pretty woman look down each time
i got the baddest boots on the boulevard
yeah the baddest boots on the boulevard

verse 2
they were made by a little man
down in el paso
i was passing though town
singing at the rodeo
he said they cost a little more
but for what its worth
there aint another pair like them
on gods green earth
then i handed him my money
and he sized me up

yeah theyre made to fit
and theyre hard to find

yeah the baddest boots on the boulevard

verse 3
i got the baddest boots on the boulevard
yeah the baddest boots on the boulevard
when i pull them on i start singing a song
make me want to tuck my britches legs inside them
letâ€™s take a stroll
