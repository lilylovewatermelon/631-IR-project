its three oclock in the morning
i hear something buzzing
over on that table beside the bed
your name lighting up in red
aint no cars going down the street
nobody would be calling me
this time of night in their right mind

chorus
somebodys been drinking
somebodys been thinking about us
somebodys all alone picking up the phone
and they know they ought just hang up
somebodys going to be knocking
somebodys going to be letting somebody in
saying hey can i stay one more time its ok
so here we go again
somebodys been drinking

verse 2
we know no good together
but you only seem to remember
the good stuff when you got a good buzz
youll stop me after that first kiss
and say we got to quit doing this
but we dont and we do but we wont
because we know how good it is
