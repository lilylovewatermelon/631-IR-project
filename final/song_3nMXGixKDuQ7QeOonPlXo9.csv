i wish i could cross my arms and cross your mind
cause i believe youd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
all my life i wish i broke mirrors instead of promises
cause all i see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
i wish i had covered all my tracks completely cause im so afraid
is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train
lift your arms only heaven knows where the danger grows
and its safe to say theres a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
help is on the way
help is on the way
help is on the way
help is on the way

chorus adam young
i forget the last time i felt brave i just recall insecurity
cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me

verse 2 adam young matthew thiessen
depression please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
oh please be done how much longer can this drama afford to run
fate looks sharp severs all my ties
and breaks whatever doesnt bend
but sadly then all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
back down again
back down again
back down again
back down again
back down again
back down again
back down again

i forget the last time i felt brave i just recall insecurity
cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me
then i was given grace and love i was blind but now i can see
cause i found a new hope from above and courage swept over me

outro adam young
it hurts just to wake up whenever youre wearing thin
alone on the outside so tired of looking in
the end is uncertain and ive never been so afraid
but i dont need a telescope to see that theres hope
and that makes me feel brave1embed"
