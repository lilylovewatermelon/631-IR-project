hi

verse 1 alice glass
scars will heal soon
the dregs in us spent the earth down

verse 2 alice glass
better than drowning in a burlap sack
i live as alice i die
children shouldnt play with dead things
foaming crows tear at their wings
sad eyes cry crimson blood

verse 3 alice glass
drop it its dead
wheels wont turn they wont turn the birdys head
sad eyes
sad eyes like sharpened daggers
youll never walk only stagger
sad eyes quite cryptic
