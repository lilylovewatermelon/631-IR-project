summer after high school when we first met
wed make out in your mustang to radiohead
and on my eighteenth birthday we got matching tattoos
used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
talked about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day id be losing you

chorus
in another life
i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises
be us against the world
in another life
i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were
the one that got away
the one that got away

verse 2
i was june and you were my johnny cash
never one without the other we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you i put those records on woah
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you downtown singing the blues
its time to face the music im no longer your muse
you might also likechorus
but in another life
i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises
be us against the world
in another life
i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were
the one that got away
the one that got away

postchorus
the one
the one
the one
the one that got away

bridge
all this money cant buy me a time machine no
cant replace you with a million rings no
i shouldve told you what you meant to me woah
cause now i pay the price

chorus
in another life
i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises
be us against the world
in another life
i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were
the one that got away
the one that got away the one that got away
postchorus
the one the one
the one the one
the one the one
in another life
i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were
the one that got away
the one that got away49embed"
