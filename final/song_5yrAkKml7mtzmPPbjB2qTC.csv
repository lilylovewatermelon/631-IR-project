theres something in the air
the girls are runnin round in summer dresses
with their masks off and it makes me so happy
larchmont village smells like lilies of the valley
and the bookstore doors are opening
and its finally happening

prechorus
ever since i fell out of love with you i fell back in love with me
and boy does it feel sweet
like a summer breeze
ever since i fell out of love with you i fell back in love with the city
like thе paramount sign sparkling
sparkling just for me

chorus
you made me tradе my violets for roses
you tried to trade in my new truck for rollses
dont forget all of these things that you love are the same things i hate
a simple life i chose this
you made me trade my violets for roses
you tried to take all the pink off my toes and
god knows the only mistake that a man can make
is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

verse 2
theres something in the air
i hope it doesnt change that its for real
the beginning of something big happening
and by the mayor the rallies
in the streets have ceased
and still the shadows haunt the avenue
the silence is deafening

prechorus
ever since i fell out of love with you i fell back in love with the streets
and god does it feel sweet
like a summer breeze
ever since i fell out of love with you i breakdance to the backbeat
and god does it sound sweet
like its playing just for me

chorus
you made me trade my violets for roses
you tried to trade in my new truck for rollses
dont forget all of these things that you love are the same things i hate
a simple life i chose this
you made me trade my violets for roses
you tried to take all the pink off my toes and
god knows the only mistake that a man can make
is tryin to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses
postchorus
ahlaha ahha
trade her violets for roses
ahlaha ahha
trade her violets for roses
ahlaha ahha

outro
theres something in the air
the girls are runnin round in summer dresses
with their masks off and it makes me so happy13embed"
