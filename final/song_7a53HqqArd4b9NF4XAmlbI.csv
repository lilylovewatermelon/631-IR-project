if all of the kings had their queens on the throne
we would pop champagne and raise a toast
to all of the queens who are fighting alone
baby youre not dancing on your own

verse 1

think its funny but honey cant run this show on your own
i can feel my body shake theres only so much i can take
ill show you how a real queen behaves oh

once i start breathin fire you cant tame me
and you might think im weak without a sword
but if i had one itd be bigger than yours

in chess a king can move one space at a time
but queens are free to go wherever they like
you get too close youll get a royalty high
so breathe it in to feel alive

to all of the queens who are fighting alone
baby youre not dancing on your own
