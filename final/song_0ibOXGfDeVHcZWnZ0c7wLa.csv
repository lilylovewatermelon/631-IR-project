have you ever wanted to die
when you were without your friends
havent you said goodbye
to the one on who your life depends

could it be that i dont wanna save you anymore
could it be that we dont have what it takes

verse 2
have you ever wished for fire
to burn away your minds restraints
havent you been for hire
or suffered those cheap complaints

could it be that i dont wanna save you anymore
could it be that we dont have what it takes

chorus
take it away cause i dont like this anymore
take it away and throw it away
