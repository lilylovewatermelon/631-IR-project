verse 1
the tv says mother is hurtin
that the clock reads quarter to twelve
so i shop my face off at urban
just trying to look a little more like myself

chorus
what do you spend your money on
i hope its something of value
what do you spend your money on

verse 2
the first time to your apartment
i was peeking in between my fingers
oh the things i hoped we had in common
wishful thinker

chorus
what do you spend your money on
i hope its something of value
are you the driver or is someone driving you
what do you spend spend your
what do you spend on your money on

bridge
you take me up to the party and we cross right over the barrier
im not sure whats more disarming than fake breasts and miniature terriers

chorus
what do you spend your money on
i hope its something of value
are you the driver or is someone driving you
what do you spend on spend on
what do you spend on your money on
i hope its something of value2embed"
