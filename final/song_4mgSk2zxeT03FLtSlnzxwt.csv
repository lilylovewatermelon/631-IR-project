verse 1
i look in the mirror
and i see the worst in parts of me
that i dont want but id never tell you that
id never tell you that
and you look amazing
so how can i stand watching you be and i feel small
damn i wish i could change all that
i wish i could change all that

chorus
but from what i know youll never go away
dont ever leave my side baby ill die
but from what i know youre always here to stay
youre an angel in disguise

verse 2
living in hell
and maybe youll save me in the end i need your help
and im here if you need mine
you need mine
when im overwhelmed
i take a vacation in my head and dont bring no one else
i guess you could come sometime
come some time
