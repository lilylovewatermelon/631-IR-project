where i come from isnt all that great
my automobile is a piece of crap
my fashion sense is a little whack
and my friends are just as screwy as me
i didnt go to boarding schools
preppy girls never looked at me
why should they i aint nobody
got nothing in my pocket

chorus
beverly hills thats where i want to be
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills
beverly hills rollin like a celebrity
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills

verse 2
look at all those movie stars
theyre all so beautiful and clean
when the housemaids scrub the floors
they get the spaces in between
i wanna live a life like that
i wanna be just like a king
take my picture by the pool
cause im the next big thing
see weezer liveget tickets as low as 225you might also likechorus
beverly hills thats where i want to be
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills
beverly hills rollin like a celebrity
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills

the truth is
i dont stand a chance
its something that youre born into
and i just dont belong

verse 3
no i dont im just a no class beat down fool
and i will always be that way
i might as well enjoy my life
and watch the stars play

chorus
beverly hills thats where i want to be
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills
beverly hills rollin like a celebrity
gimme gimme gimme gimme
livin in beverly hills
