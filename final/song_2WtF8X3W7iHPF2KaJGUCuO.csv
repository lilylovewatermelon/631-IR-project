do you have the time
to listen to me whine
about nothin and everything all at once
i am one of those
melodramatic fools
neurotic to the bone no doubt about it

chorus
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think im cracking up
am i just paranoid
or am i just stoned

verse 2
i went to a shrink
to analyze my dreams
she says its lack of sex thats bringin me down
i went to a whore
he said my lifes a bore
so quit my whinin cause its bringin her down

chorus
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think im cracking up
am i just paranoid
huh yeah yeah yeah
ooh ooh
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likebridge
grasping to control
so i better hold on

chorus
sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think im cracking up
am i just paranoid
or am i just stoned64embed"
