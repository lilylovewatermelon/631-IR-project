fall is here hear the yell
back to school ring the bell
brand new shoes walking blues
climb the fence books and pens
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
i can tell that we are gonna be friends

verse 2
walk with me suzy lee
through the park and by the tree
we will rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs we found
safely walk to school without a sound
safely walk to school without a sound

verse 3
here we are no one else
we walk to school all by ourselves
theres dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now its time to learn
we clean up and now its time to learn

verse 4
numbers letters learn to spell
nouns and books and show and tell
playtime we will throw the ball
back to class through the hall
teacher marks our height against the wall
teacher marks our height against the wall
you might also likebridge
and we dont notice any time pass
we dont notice anything
we sit side by side in every class
teacher thinks that i sound funny
but she likes the way you sing

verse 5
tonight ill dream while i’m in bed
when silly thoughts go through my head
about the bugs and alphabet
and when i wake tomorrow ill bet
that you and i will walk together again

outro
i can tell that we are gonna be friends
yes i can tell that we are gonna be friends19embed"
