its one hazy panoply
recount this halcyon age
i turn to anthony
when he turned to karlheinz and cage

but no ones really there
does that mean its done in vain
if no one really cares
im back to acting strange

prechorus
like daniel johnston in texas
at some point in the eighties
passing out his cassettes with
the jcard that he drew oh did he ever expect it
i guess its just what happens when the musics a respite
the world is so appalling and you come to detest it

chorus
and you could say that i was nervous then
fairly awkward now
leave the speakers loud
when you feel selfdoubt
if theres any chance
that wed still hang out
we could detail dreams
while we stare at passing clouds
you might also likeverse 2
those modal masterworks
atonal oeuvres it seems
when i ask afterwards
all message lost in between
the shifting aperture
depicting sunsoaked scenes
i guess they resonate
thats universal consciousness

prechrorus
take two of ascension
the shape of jazz to come and
laurie spiegels inventions
orourke or zorn and oliveros all deserve mention
youre dancing in a room and no ones paying attention

chorus
addressing my reception with a focused eye
to the passing clouds
ill be there for you
when youre feeling down
any given day
you can find me round
in a despondent way
in a study best called brown4embed"
