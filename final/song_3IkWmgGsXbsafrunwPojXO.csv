i saw the sun begin to dim
and felt that winter wind blow cold
a man learns who is there for him
when the glitter fades and the walls wont hold
cause from then rubble one remains
can only be whats true
if all was lost theres more i gained
cause it led me back to you

chorus hugh jackman
from now on
these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
from now on
whats waited til tomorrow starts tonight tonight
let this promise in me start
like an anthem in my heart
from now on
from now on

verse 2 hugh jackman
i drank champagne with kings and queens
the politicians praised my name
but those were someone elses dreams
the pitfalls of the man i became
for years and years i chased their cheers
a crazy speed of always needin more
but when i stop and see you here
i remember who all this was for
you might also likechorus
and from now on
these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
from now on
whats waited til tomorrow starts tonight it starts tonight
and let this promise in me start
like an anthem in my heart
from now on
from now on
from now on
