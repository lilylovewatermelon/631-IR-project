hung over and hard up

verse 1
broken down and messed up
i never saw your leaving coming but
i sure felt it when ya left
memory button stuck on repeat
mind skipping like a record machine
over and over that goodbye scene
keeps spinning in my head
it keeps haunting me
and there aint no maybe about it
the hurt keeps calling me
come on out we got you surrounded
yeah the bottle in my hand is loaded and
i aint afraid to use it tonight

chorus
hung over and hard up

verse 2
pain hurts whiskeys tough
and too much aint ever enough
to break through your space
living in a lost and found
round and round up and down
im tired of this seesaw merrygoround
so merry you can go to hell
all i want to do
is just get on down the highway
and ill be there as soon as
i get on out of my way
yeah the truth is like a hangmans noose
and its holding up my heart tonight

hung over and hard up

verse 3
i tried it all well now what
ive given everything but up
and ups going down the drain
just when i thought the coast was clear
youre clouding up my atmosphere
that morning suns waiting there when i wake up
hung over and hard upembed"
