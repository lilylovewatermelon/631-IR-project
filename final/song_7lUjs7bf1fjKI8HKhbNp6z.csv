ever since i was young
your word is the word that always won
worry and wake the ones you love
a phone call id rather not receive
please use my body while i sleep
my lungs are fresh and yours to keep
kept clean and they will let you breathe

prechorus 1
is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry
i am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind

chorus
nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
so i sat alone and waited out the night
the best part of what has happened was the part i must have missed
so im asking you to shine it on and stick around
im not writing my goodbyes

verse 2
i submit no excuse
if this is what i have to do
i owe you every day i wake
if i could i would shrink myself
and sink through your skin to your blood cells
and remove whatever makes you hurt
but i am too weak to be your cure
you might also likeprechorus 1

chorus

so i sat alone and waited out the night
the best part of what has happened was the part i must have missed
so im asking you to shine it on and stick around
im not writing my goodbyes

bridge
im not letting you check out
you will beat this starting now
and you will always be around
im there to monitor your breathing
i will watch you while youre sleeping
i will keep you safe and sound

prechorus 2
does anybody remember back when you were very young
did you ever think that you would be this blessed

chorus
nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
so i sat alone and waited out the night
the best part of what has happened was the part i must have missed
so im asking you to shine it on and stick around
im not writing my goodbyes5embed"
