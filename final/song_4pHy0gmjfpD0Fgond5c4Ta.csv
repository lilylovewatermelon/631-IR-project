wish i could be a little more mature
did my time did myself for sure
river wide got myself afloat
demons die if i dont support
demons die if i dont support
and why cant i be like everybody else oh woah
losin my mind think i look good when im really just high
scared of my life can a bitch get by get by
sick of listening to everyone else oh ooh
sick of my pride ooh sick of just sayin shit just to be nice oh
scared of this world how do i get by

chorus
miles runnin wild in my head miles runnin wild
