we stay moving around solo
ask us where you at we dont know
and dont care dont care
all we know is we was at home cause you left us there
you got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
now she in the club with a freaky dress on
cats dont want her to keep that dress on
tryna get enough drinks in her system
take it to the tele and make her a victim

prechorus 1
patron on the brain ball player in her face
they shake the spot shes just another case

chorus
easy for a good girl to go bad
and once weve gone gone
best believe weve gone forever
dont be the reason dont be the reason
you better learn how to treat us right
cause once a good girl goes bad we done forever

verse 2
hes stayin with a flock of em oh yeah
got a girl at home but he dont care
wont care wont care
all hell do is keep me at home wont let me go nowhere
he thinks because im at home i wont be gettin it on
and now im finding numbers in the jacket pockets
tricks callin the house nonstop its
getting out of control finally i cant take no more yeah
