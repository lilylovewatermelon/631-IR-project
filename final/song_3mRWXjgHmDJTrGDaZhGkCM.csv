babylon is falling down
everybody losing control
people use and abuse this world
and now it is takin its toll
these times have changed

verse
time will tell heaven or hell
you gotta start giving your love
maybe then you will open your eyes
and end up in heaven above
there is light at the end of the darkness
so why dont you come out and see
yeah
some are prisoners of this world lord
but you were never right to be
these times

chorus
babylon is falling falling falling falling falling down
