verse 1
bought her brand new shoes told her kick rocks
dont stand too close diamonds kickbox
think red means go so i dont stop
i know they wish they could catch me but keep wishin
you think i done turned into a fiend for these bitches
tryna stuff as much as i can in these britches
made your bitch fuck on my friend its no difference
i aint never popped no xan i sip sizzurp
if i ever have to tell on the gang i wont do it
if i put it on a song i seen it or been through it
i cant put it in my song i know how the feds move
scream free all of the ahks but i aint no famgoon

got the crowd goin dumb but i aint no damn fool
if i went in there and did it and made it you can too

aint been home in a month got my ho mad
they need me in the trap but i cant go back
i jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
i got ms in the bank give a damn what they think
every vibe i ever shot my shot at caught it
everything you ever seen me riding in bought it
big dawg status i aint gotta sell drugs
put my craft into rap then i took off yeah
