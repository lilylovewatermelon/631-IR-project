if there hadnt been a darkness
i wouldve never seen the light
i wouldnt long for the sunrise
if it wasnt for the night

verse 2
if there hadnt been a father
who made a way when there was none
id still be an orphan
if it wasnt for his son

chorus
if there hadnt been a grave
if there hadnt been a cross
my heart would still be buried
and my soul would still be lost
if there hadnt been a savior
who died to make a way
id still be a dead man
if there hadnt been a grave

verse 3
if it wasnt for the breaking
i would never know the mend
i wouldnt know the sweetness of freedom
if it wasnt for my sin
and if there hadnt been forgiveness
that covered all my shame
oh id still be a debtor
if he didnt take my place

if there hadnt been a cross
my heart would still be buried
and my soul would still be lost
if there hadnt been a savior
who died to make a way
oh id still be a dead man
