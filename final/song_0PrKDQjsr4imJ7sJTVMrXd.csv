yeah
i put you out like a cigarette
poured you down the drain with no regrets
went through 11 of those 12 steps
but 11 aint enough i guess
one phone call on a lonely night
and were both back at the startin line
now theres ashes in the ashtray
lipstick on the bottle
back on the same road goin full throttle
and just like that

chorus
we go fallin off the wagon
got ourselves a real bad habit
girl you got me actin like an addict
all messed up no matter what
you know i just gotta have it
even though it winds up tragic
tonight whatever happens happens
and tomorrow well get back on the wagon
yeah
well get back on the wagon whoa

verse 2
so lets let both ends of the candle burn
love like the mornin light wont hurt
wake up lyin bout lessons learned
cause thats just what we do
again and again
