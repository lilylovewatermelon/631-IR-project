we were spittin venom
at most everyone we know
if the damned gave us a road map
then wed know just where to go

chorus
now let it drop
let it all drop
let it all drop
ah let it all fall off

verse 2
well you were talking soda pop
you talked it quite a lot
the opinions that i do not give
and the opinions i aint got

chorus
so let it drop
let it all drop
let it all drop
let it all fall off

verse 3
well oh ahh ooh
well you were spitting venom
at most everyone you know
if you truly knew the gravity
youd know which way to go
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likechorus
well let it drop
let it all drop
let it all drop
oh let it all fall off

verse 4
my ears were pressed so firmly
right against your mouth to hear
when you tried to spit the venom out
your words were not so clear
now drop

bridge 1
hold on to what you need
weve got a knack for fucked up history
hold on to what you need
weve got a knack for messed up history

bridge 2
well we went downtown
and we sat in the rain both
lookin one direction
and waitin for a train
of thought over
thought over
i dont who kept track
i didnt know there was a score
but it looks like youre the winner
and i aint gonna play no more
its over
game over

bridge 3
well we walked real stiff
and our canes tapped the ground
you hit me with yours
and said youre gonna stare me down
its over
oh its over
you can say what you want
but dont act like you care
it takes more than one person
to decide whats fair
its over
think it over

instrumental build

verse 5
you were spittin venom
at most everyone you know
if the damned gave you a road map
then youd know just where to go
so we carried all the groceries in
while haulin out the trash
and if this doesnt make us motionless
i do not know what can
sos to say oh what a rotten thing to say
such an awful thing to say
i didnt mean to bite you sorry
what always did what always did
what always had to slang
chorus
so let it drop
let it all drop
let it all drop
oh let it all fall off
let it drop
let it all drop
let it all drop
oh let it all fall off
