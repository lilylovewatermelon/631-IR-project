ladies and gentlemen

whew that drip
yeah okay

verse 1
writin on writers block havent slept in days
they wanna put me in the psycho watch everyones afraid
of what i do inside my studio worried ima lose control
they rufflin my feathers and they shufflin the yugioh
execution flow at your neck like new cologne
uno dos bitch im in your head like freddy krueger though
my brain fried always chasin the same high
im too fucked up to function do nothin but waste time
woke up annihilated lyin on the pavement
covered in items i regurgitated under a fire escape
and i know that its friday cause every friday they have a parade
infront of city hall hear em celebrate they havin a ball
my pupils dilated highly dehydrated im lost inside a giant matrix
isolate myself from eyes i find contagious
jump above the comedown
im strung out noddin off inside the dugout

verse 2
yeah
im playin hot potato on a winnebago
the chips are stale they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
and whats an angel with a missin halo
she would drop outta school to take a trip to dayglow
found a twenty layin by the sewer rats
you know little stuart hasnt been in any movies lately
hes spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
his agent workin hard to try and book him a commercial
what i do should not concern you do this til i turn blue
not eric sermon im more merlin curses turn em into bird food
hurry to make the first move im walkin like herschel
and now we at the end of verse two oh
