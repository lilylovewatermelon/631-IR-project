verse 1
cant stop thinking about if and when i die
for now i see that if and when are truly different cries
for if is purely panic and when is solemn sorrow
and one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
were surrounded and were hounded
theres no above or under or around it
for above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve
and around is scientific miracle lets pick above and see
for if and when we go above the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same
and thats when goin under starts to take my wonder
but until that time ill try to sing this

chorus
if i keep moving they wont know
ill morph to someone else
what they throw at mes too slow
ill morph to someone else
im just a ghost
ill morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode

hell always try to stop me that nicolas bourbaki
hes got no friends close but those who know him most know
he goes by nico he told me im a copy
when id hear him mock me thats almost stopped me
well were surrounded and were hounded
theres no above or a secret door
what are we here for
if not to run straight through all our tormentors
but until that time ill try to sing this

chorus
if i keep moving they wont know
ill morph to someone else
what they throw at mes too slow
ill morph to someone else
im just a ghost
ill morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode
ill morph to someone else

bridge
lights they blink to me transmitting things to me
ones and zeroes ergo this symphony
anybody listening ones and zeroes
count to infinity ones and zeroes
im surrounded and im hounded
theres no above or under or around it
for above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve
and around is scientific miracle lets pick above and see
for if and when we go above the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same
and thats when goin under starts to take my wonder
but until that time
ill morph to someone else
im just a ghost
