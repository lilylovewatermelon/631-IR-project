theres a picture on my kitchen wall
looks like jesus and his friends involved
theres a party getting started in the yard
theres a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
was i too young to see this with my eyes

verse 2
by the pool last night apparently
the chemicals werent mixed properly
you hit your head and then forgot your name
and then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
and now your altitude and memorys a shame

chorus
what about taking this empty cup and filling it up
with a little bit more of innocence
i havent had enough its probably because when youre young
its okay to be easily ignored
i like to believe it was all about love for a child

verse 3
and when the house was left in shambles
who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
well im far too old to care about that now

what about taking this empty cup and filling it up
with a little bit more of innocence
i havent had enough its probably because when youre young

verse 4
its kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
ive been enjoying both my christmases and my birthday cakes
and taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
and they never check to see my grades
what a fool id be to start complaining now

chorus
what about taking this empty cup and filling it up
with a little bit more of innocence
i havent had enough its probably because when youre young
its okay to be easily ignored
i like to believe it was all about love for a child

outro
it was all about loveembed"
