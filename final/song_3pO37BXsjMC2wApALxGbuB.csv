change my attempt good intentions

verse 1
crouched over you were not there living in fear
but signs were not really that scarce obvious tears
but i will not hide you through this i want you to help them
please see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt
die withdraw hide in cold sweat quivering lips
ignore remorse naming a kid living wasteland
this time youve tried all that you can turning you red

chorus
change my attempt good intentions
should i could i
here we are with your obsession
should i could i

verse 2

this time youve tried all that you can turning you red
but i will not hide you through this i want you to help

chorus
change my attempt good intentions
should i could i
here we are with your obsession
should i could i

chorus
change my attempt good intentions
limbs tied skin tight
self inflicted his perdition
should i could i
change my attempt good intentions
should i could i
