dont you remember
the fizz in a pepper
peanuts in a bottle
at ten two and four
a fried bologna sandwich
with mayo and tomato
sittin round the table
do not happen much anymore

prechorus 1
we got too complicated
its all way overrated
i like the old and outdated
way of life

chorus
back when a ho was a hoe
coke was a coke
and cracks what you were doing
when you were cracking jokes
back when a screw was a screw
the wind was all that blew
and when you said i am down with that
well it meant you had the flu
i miss back when
i miss back when
i miss back when
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 2
i love my records
black shiny vinyl
clicks and pops
and white noise
man they sounded fine
i had my favorite stations
the ones that played em all
country soul and rocknroll
what happened to those times

prechorus 2
i am reading street slang for dummies
cause they put pop in my country
i want more for my money
the way it was back then

chorus
back when a ho was a hoe
coke was a coke
and cracks what you were doing
when you were cracking jokes
back when a screw was a screw
the wind was all that blew
and when you said i am down with that
well it meant you had the flu
i miss back when
i miss back when
i miss back when
bridge
give me a flat top for strummin
i want the whole world to be hummin
oh just keep it comin
the way it was back then

chorus
back when a ho was a hoe
coke was a coke
and cracks what you were doing
when you were cracking jokes
back when a screw was a screw
the wind was all that blew
and when you said i am down with that
well it meant you had the flu
i miss back when
i miss back when
i miss back when

outro
i miss back when
