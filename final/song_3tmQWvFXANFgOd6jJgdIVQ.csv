then i can build it
the machine that snaps
all of time in half
i can break its back
i can break its back

i can build a door
and i can travel through
they do it with telefony
you dont see it much anymore but
but surely i
but surely i
if i could just hear your voice
if i could just hear your voice
but i dont think i have the choice

the look on your face
when i first connect the line
for the very first time
my words come slowly to mind
is anybody there
all trembling and scared
replies then come
fainter than air
