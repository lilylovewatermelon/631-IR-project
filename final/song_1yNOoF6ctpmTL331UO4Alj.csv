verse 6 2pac

release me to the streets and keep whatevers left of me
jealousy is misery suffery is greed
better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me

bow down in the presence of a boss player

verse 7 snoop dogg
its like cuh blood gangbangin
everybody in the party doin dopeslangin
you gotta have paper in this world
you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you doin your job every day
and then you work so hard til your hair turn gray
let me tell you bout life and bout the way it is
you see we live by the gun so we die by the guns kid
verse 8 2pac
they tell me not to roll with my glock
so now i got a throwaway
floatin in the black benz bitch tryin to do a show a day
they wonder how i live with five shots
niggas is hard to kill on my block
schemes for currency and doughrelated
affiliated with the hustlers so we made it
no answers to questions im tryin to get up on it
my nigga dogg and me eternally the most wanted
