verse 1
baby sit down
i got something that i need to say right now
before the rumors spread and make their way around town
i thought id be a man and tell you first
but i know its going to hurt
baby please let me explain let me explain
it happened all the sudden out of control ohhhh
she had my heart and would not let it go goohhhh
im not tryin to say that it was okay
or that i didnt do it

hook
but i gotta tell the truth the whole truth
with my right hand up
cause i dont wanna lose you its time to man up
i just gotta be the one to tell you

baby if i wouldve never seen her walkin down the block
i probably would have not pulled over and asked her
if she needed a ride
but i noticed she had makeup on her eyes
then she started to cry
i said baby please explain please explain
she said her man put his hands on her
he was outta control outta control
and she really need someone to hold and not let go
and then she looked into my eyes just like you do
then i imagined she was you

baby now i wish that i was a magician and i
could make all of this disappear
and baby i wish that i could go back in time
and trust me baby we wouldnt be here we just wouldnt be here
but youve been so good to me how could i do this to you
and i never meant to hurt you how can i prove it to you
im just tryin to say whats been on my mind
cause it hurts you
