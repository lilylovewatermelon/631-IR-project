well i always heard tale of a little bitty still in the backwoods
where old hillbilly bill made corn and sugar taste real good
so me and my buds finally got the nerve up
took a little chugalug from a big brown jug
sweet and so smooth it took me to the moon
i said billy brother what we ought to do is

chorus
bottle it up
load it in the back of my truck
yeah i bet you we could take it into town
pass it all around and folks will never get enough
i said bottle it up
aint no lying its some mighty mighty powerful stuff
sell it by the keg sell it by the case
make a couple million bucks
bottle it up

verse 2
at seventeen brother i was green as the grass was
and i hadnt ever seen nothing near as pretty as she was
she was leading me around like a lovesick hound
when she came slipping out of that pink prom gown
lordy i was leaving dancing on the ceiling
i wish that i could take that feeling and

well first time buzz first time hook
first time foot on the throttle rush
bottle it up
go on and bottle it up

chorus
yeah bottle it up
load it in the back of my truck
cause now i bet you we could take it into town
pass it all around and folks will never get enough
i said bottle it up

sell it by the keg sell it by the case
make a couple million bucks
bottle it up
