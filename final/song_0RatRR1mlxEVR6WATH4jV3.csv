if my man was fightin some unholy war
i would be behind him
straight shook up beside him with strength
he didnt know its you im fightin for
he cant lose with me in tow with me in tow
i refuse to let him go to let him go
at his side and drunk on pride
we wait for the blow

verse 2
we put it in writin but who you writin for
just us on kitchen floor
justice done recitin my stomach standin still
like youre readin my will
he still stands in spite of what his scars say scars say
and ill battle til this bitter finale bitter finale
just me my dignity
and this guitar case woah woah

outro
yes yes my mans fightin some unholy war
and i will stand beside you
but who you dyin for
b i would have died too id  like to
if my man was fightin some unholy war
yeah if my man was fightinyou might also like8embed"
