gotta bring it to you cowards yall wanted it
cowards and its gonna be sicker than all the niggas–

verse 1
you can tell a nigga like me aint never had shit
rip i miss my dawgs like mike vick
zombies in that midnight fog them bars sick em
fall victim to a gun brawl started over some bitches huh
niggas trippin they takin whatevers given
the irony when a niggas starvin gotta grip the biscuit
jump the fence empty all the dishes out your kitchen
if you witness it then click click click and they spill the grits
feel the kick fuck a fair catch kill em who tryna take the hit
first take go to first base stephen a smith wess
on the hip talkin shit like skip
or shannon sharpshootin off the top of the cliff
and if i gotta bring it to you cowards then its gonna be sick
put in my ten thousand hours while the clock still ticks
zone6 five fingers with the suck my dick
me and izzy was slapboxin nigga bust my lip
start fightin lil brother on some tough guy shit
but if you ever did me wrong he on some whats right shit
bust a left feel the pressure like the bus pipe drip

verse 3
look uh i do it for royal and rosalyn rachel and carl
izzy precious destin strong seven kids different blessings hey
izzy athletic as fuck allamerican star hard head
scholarship at a school in new orleans
on the football shit but in class he on the smart shit hey
black man using his mind its a target on your forehead
gotta stay on point like a marksman
make a mark leave a footprint went for a marching
bro graduating so we heading to the blue state
fam celebrating granny cooking up a few cakes
yeah gown on with the cap like a toupee
handed a diploma all the routes say hooray
yeah hooray today catch a bouquet
tonight it probably be a movie whats a bluray
i got some new js and a fade we hit the section
with the football team and a couple other professionals
it sound cool but really this a confessional hey
twenty minutes in it precious and nem went to the restroom
said they got to hittin with some women and they bout to get kicked out
they aint even tell us what that shit was about
all i really seen from the big vip couch
was a nigga swing and hit my sister right in the mouth
the bouncer tried to block the door that way we couldnt get out
but fuck that the whole team bust that motherfucker down
now we fighting in the street its like ten against twentythree
i was seventeen swinging on any and everything
bing bing see my brother doing buddy like a boxing ring
ros got a bitch doing the hair weave sling
so beautiful beating ass was like a family thing
fighting together made us tighter in spite of how we would argue and scream
and now we brawling right outside of a party in new orleans
and all the people start policecalling
pack us inside of a paddy wagon we sardines
to saltine crackers that wanna shackle us in chains hey
lo and behold they held us in a holding cell for six
or maybe seven hours just to let us go without a stain
but whos to blame when all of us got the same mind frame
we like a gang mom and popll probably be proud and ashamed
pound for pound my sister precious never lost a fade
got up off the ground and she said she could hear my father sayin
chorus
when you fall down stand up get the bandage
i aint got cheeseburger money make a sandwich
why you bein bad see ya dad get your ass whipped
seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan yeah

outro
hold on hold on hold on
what happened what happened what happened
we came in the club
were talking we go in the restroom
i go in the bathroom open the door
dang b you couldve said sorry
ros said b you aint gotta say all that it aint that serious
and she was all oh its that serious because you were in the bathroom
ros said okay b i got you b come outside
taj she opened the door rosalyn said roof
