we were electrocute
in our hasbeen 1980s suits
so electrocute
everyone we knew said it too
thats when even strangers knew our names
ten years later sighed what a shame

verse 2
we were electrocute
to make the point again is moot
ssssssso electrocute
how on you ive wasted my youth
your cold eyes of coney island sand
hair dyed the blood of a foolish man

so proud to be by your side
we were a team no one denied

even though i still miss your lips
youre about as real as your tits
