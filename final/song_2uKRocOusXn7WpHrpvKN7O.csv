yeah the song comes on and i sing out loud
and there aint no road that i cant go down
and i dont think twice when i pass your house all the time
yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
and i dont get caught in the same old traps
i can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
yeah the world dont revolve around you
not everythings about you

verse 1
sunsets happening
my phone rings
im finally laughing
and doing things with my friends

prechorus
we drink to this
we drink to that
lets roll that 8 ball in the rack
its what i have not what i had

chorus
and the song comes on and i sing out loud
and there aint no road that i cant go down
and i dont think twice when i pass your house all the time
yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
and i dont get caught in the same old traps
i can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
yeah the world dont revolve around you
not everythings about you anymore

and there aint no road that i cant go down
and i dont think twice when i pass your house all the time

not everythings about you anymore
