when our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow
when our summers grow longer and winters wont snow
from the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
to the fight in the desert where progress stands still
when weve lost our will

chorus
thats how well know
this is not a test well know
this is cardiac arrest
of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
were crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace

verse 2
when the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
when the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
when your home on the range has been torn down and paved
and the buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
what more will it take

chorus
for us to know
this is not a test oh no
this is cardiac arrest
of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
kissing the ground as we all fall from grace
you might also likeverse 3
this is a chance to set things straight
to bend or break the rules back into place
there is no middle ground no compromise
weve drawn the line
with perfect aim we stand back and throw
glass windows break and its all about to blow
lights go out as we pass the torch again
in hope that it stays lit

neutrality means that you dont really care
cause the struggle goes on even when youre not there
blind and unaware

chorus
thats how well know
this is not a test oh no
this is cardiac arrest
of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
were crashing into the ground as we all yeah we all all fall from grace7embed"
