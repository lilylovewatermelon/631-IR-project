mama you taught me to do the right things
so now you have to let your baby fly
youve given me everything that i will need
to make it through this crazy thing called life

prechorus
and i know you watched me grow up
and only want whats best for me
and i think i found the answer to your prayers

chorus
and he is good so good
he treats your little girl like a real man should
he is good so good
he makes promises he keeps
no hes never gonna leave
so dont you worry about me
dont you worry about me

verse 2
mama theres no way youll ever lose me
