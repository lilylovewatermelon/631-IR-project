ive tolerated more than i could take
i’ve given more than ive received
ive been there more than those who were supposed to be there for me
i’ve chased love
ive been down and to a better place
ive let certain things go in lust of a better taste
ive watched time pass by moving at a slower pace ive chased
pleasure
ive made others take a loss for my gain
ive gained at the cost of someone elses pain
i’ve been an active student of the game
i’ve chased wealth
in my lifetime ive realized
that there is more wants than needs people are facing
and sometimes what we already have is what we aren’t embracing
i understand that every last person in this world has desires
but i also understand that only a few are worth chasing
