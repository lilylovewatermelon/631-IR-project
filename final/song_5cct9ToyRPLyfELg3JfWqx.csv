sneaking the pillow under the sheets
i know a place where everyone meets
but she knows a place
where the cops dont go
and shed be the one if anyone knows

prechorus
if half the fun was to cut and run
and the other half was getting caught

chorus
then dont stop dont stop
she was the daughter of a cop
dont stop dont stop
the daughter of a cop

verse 2
making love is an easy thing to do
and she didnt feel like pushing herself
but dont be fooled
cause it could have been you
or him or anyone else

prechorus
if half the fun was to cut and run
and the other half was getting caught
you might also likeverse 3
then when the fix comes in
shell get a slap on the wrist
and leave you in a cell to rot

chorus
so dont stop dont stop
she was the daughter of a cop
dont stop dont stop
the daughter of a cop

outro
dont stop dont stop
the daughter of a cop2embed"
