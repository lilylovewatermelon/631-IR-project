verse 1
well i crossed the river fell into the sea
where the nonbelievers go beyond belief
then i scratched the surface in the mouth of hell
runnin out of service in the blood i fell

chorus
well i i just wanna see the light
and i i dont wanna lose my sight
well i i just wanna see the light
and i need to know whats worth the fight

verse 2
well ive been wasted pills and alcohol
and ive been chasin down the pool halls
then i drank the water from a hurricane
and i set a fire just to see the flame

chorus
well i i just wanna see the light
and i i dont wanna lose my sight
well i i just wanna see the light
and i need to know whats worth the fight
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeguitar solo

verse 3
well i crossed the desert reachin higher ground
then i pound the pavement to take the liars down
but its gone forever but never too late
where the ever after is in the hands of fate

chorus
well i i just wanna see the light
and i i dont wanna lose my sight
well i i just wanna see the light
and i need to know whats worth the fight
