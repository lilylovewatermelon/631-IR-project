verse 1
sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
whenever you around i seem to come alive for ya
i finally recognize the feelings thats inside for ya
although i know your man and trust me he would die for ya
these quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
i saw you in the party soft lips softspoken
i came to talk to you but homie interfered now
he introduced you as his girl and i was heartbroken
some people talk about that love at first sight shit
to keep it real i dont know whether i believe its true
but if it is then tell me if im wrong or right if
i fell in love with you before i ever even knew
i catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
at times i feel as though im caught up in a strange dream
if eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that im feeling you feeling you
sometimes i swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

verse 2
and put my number in it—
huh im staring at you from afar
im wondering bout you like where you from and who you are
cause you a star no not the type that snort the white lines
i mean the type that light the night time
i heard you got a man but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone
tell me is your house a home
why you in the club looking like you out to zone
now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
on a scale from 1 to 10 that girls a hundred and i want it
no question i know destiny well
and though i sin the lord blessing me still
every saint got a past every sinner got a future
every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
they say its just a matter of time
and if i had my way then you would be mine huh
