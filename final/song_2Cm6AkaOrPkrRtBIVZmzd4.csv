so hold your head and hold your tongue
but only say what you have to
and as a child yes i dreamed
of holding her in the silver screen
she loved her man but loved him twice
i wish id been that passenger
having fun fly my kite
the devil inside wont control my life
and too much love so little hate
the devil inside wont control my fate

chorus
oh if only if only
oh he wasnt so lonely
hed have someone to play with
instead of bombing our neighbours yeah yeah

verse 2
so here i go to see the world
with my eyes and with my soul
and too much love so little hate
the devil inside wont control my fate

chorus
oh if only if only
oh he wasnt so lonely
hed have someone to play with
instead of bombing our neighbours yeah yeah yeah

so hold your head and run my time
the what of life no man can rhyme
so here we are and here we bleed
to be a victim theres no need
having fun i never fight
the devil inside controls my life
too much love so little hate
the devil inside will control my fate

chorus
oh if only if only
oh he wasnt so lonely
hed have someone to play with
instead of bombing our neighbours
oh if only if only
oh he wasnt so lonely
hed have someone to play with
instead of bombing our neighbours2embed"
