why’d you go and break what’s already broken
i try to take a breath but i’m already chokin’
how long til this goes away

verse 1
i try to remember to forget you
but i break down every time i do
it’s left me less than zero
beat down and bruised
i can’t see him with you

chorus 1
why’d you go and break what’s already broken
i try to take a breath but i’m already chokin’
cause everywhere i look i can see how you hold him
how long til this goes away

verse 2
i can’t seem to get my heart over you
cause you creep into everything i do
and now i’m dying to know
how he touches you
i can’t see him with you

chorus 2
why’d you go and break what’s already broken
i try to take a breath but i’m already chokin’
cause everywhere i look i can see how you hold him
how long til this goes away
how long til this goes away

she said she wants to be friends
i took a big step back
she said
she said
she said she’s sorry
with one finger
i said “fuck that”

bridge
i can tell you’re lyin’ when your lips move
cause of one lie it’s not me it’s you
it’s left me less than zero
beat down and bruised
i can’t see him with you

chorus 1
why’d you go and break what’s already broken
i try to take a breath but i’m already chokin’
cause everywhere i look i can see how you hold him
how long til this goes away

chorus 2
why’d you go and break what’s already broken
i try to take a breath but i’m already chokin’
cause everywhere i look i can see how you hold him
how long til this goes away
how long til this goes away
