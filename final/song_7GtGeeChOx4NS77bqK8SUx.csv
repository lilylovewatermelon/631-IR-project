verse 1 harry liam
theres a lightnin in your eyes i cant deny
then theres me inside a sinking boat runnin out of time
without you ill never make it out alive
but i know yes i know well be alright
theres a devil in your smile its chasing me
and every time i turn around its only gaining speed
theres a moment when you finally realise
theres no way you can change the rolling tide
but i know yes i know that ill be fine

chorus all
this time im ready to run ohoh
escape from the city and follow the sun
cause i wanna be yours dont you wanna be mine
i dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night
this time im ready to run ohoh
wherever you are is the place i belong
cause i wanna be free and i wanna be young
i will never look back now im ready to run

but i know yes i know well be alright
