do you know what makes this world go round
around

chorus
do you know what makes this world go round
around

verse
think it through
what it means to you
and everything you do
dont affect just you oh
i cant help but feel like i dont give a fuck
might just take this shit and blow it up
its no wonder i feel stuck
fuck what set you bang what hood you claim
we all come from the same
and i dont know if itll change
