i know a girl whos obsessed with a guy
she talks for hours and still tomorrow shell call again
and when he thinks that this could be the end she calls again
at six in the morning she waits at the door
he tells her to leave but still tomorrow shell be there again
she wont let go

chorus
cant you just go somewhere on vacation
i could book your flight and pack your bags if you want
a oneway ticket out of my life
watching you fly away
i never liked you

verse 2
she doesnt care if he tries to ignore
he runs away but still she follows shell try again
she likes to think shell get him in the end yeah

chorus
cant you just go somewhere on vacation
i could book your flight and pack your bags if you want
a oneway ticket out of my life
watching you fly away
