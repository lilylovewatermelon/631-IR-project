can we make amends
do we just pretend that were over all the violence
are we done with this
put it all to rest turn the screams now into silence
will you be a man can you make a stand
will you own up or deny it
all the time we lost was it worth the cost
of breaking our family in two
destroyed all we knew

chorus
a tyrant so defiant
lonely as your hearts sinking
consequences no defenses
if only you had been thinking
and compliant for a moment
why did both of us have to believe that we were right
tyrant

verse 2
can i clear my mind leave it all behind
start to pick up all the pieces
can i hide the scars just like prison bars
that have always seemed to confine me
will we save it all even from the fall
is there time left for revival
can i be convinced that some hope exists
with these wounds cut so deep in my soul
can we become whole
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
a tyrant so defiant
lonely as your hearts sinking
consequences no defenses
if only you had been thinking
and compliant for a moment
why did both of us have to believe that we were right
tyrant

bridge
theres so many things that i wanted to say
but the love turned to hate we kept pushing away
and the words that came out turned it into a mess
and its like pulling teeth cause youll never confess
now the damage is done
the hurt and the pain when nobody has won
have we forgot its your blood inside of my veins
that feeds my heart

chorus
a tyrant so defiant
lonely as your hearts sinking
consequences no defenses
if only you had been thinking
and compliant for a moment
why did both of us have to believe that we were right
