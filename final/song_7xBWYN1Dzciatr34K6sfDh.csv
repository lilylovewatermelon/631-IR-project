if i could open my arms
and span the length of the isle of manhattan
id bring it to where you are
making a lake of the east river and hudson
if i could open my mouth
wide enough for a marching band to march out
they would make your name sing
and bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

verse 2
i wish we could open our eyes
to see in all directions at the same time
oh what a beautiful view
if you were never aware of what was around you
and it is true what you said
that i live like a hermit in my own head
but when the sun shines again
ill pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

chorus
sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
but while you debate half empty or half full
it slowly rises your love is gonna drown
sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
but while you debate half empty or half full
it slowly rises your love is gonna drown

sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole

but while you debate half empty or half full
it slowly rises your love is gonna drown

your love is gonna drown
