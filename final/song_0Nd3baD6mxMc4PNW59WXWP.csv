i looked at your face i saw that all the love had died
i saw that we had forgotten to take the time
i i saw that you couldnt care less about what you do
couldnt care less about the lies
you couldnt find the time to cry

prechorus
we forgot about love
we forgot about faith
we forgot about trust
we forgot about us

chorus
now our loves floating out the window
our loves floating out the back door
our loves floating up in the sky in heaven
where it began
back in gods hands

verse 2
you said that you had said all that you had to say
you said baby its the end of the day
we gave a lot but it wasnt enough
we got so tired that we just gave up

now our loves floating out the window
our loves floating out the back door
our loves floating up in the sky in heaven
where it began
back in gods hands
back in gods hands

we didnt respect it
we went and neglected it
we didnt deserve it
but i never expected this

chorus
our love floated out the window
our love floated out the back door
our love floated up in the sky to heaven
its part of a plan
its back in gods hands
back in gods hands

outro
oh it didnt last
its a thing of the past

oh just what we had
oh i want it back
just what we had
i want it back
oh just what we had
no we didnt understandembed"
