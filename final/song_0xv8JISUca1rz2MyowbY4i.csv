im living in a world that wont stop pulling on me
im not complaining but its true
its like i owe my time to everyone else
because thats all i seem to do
you might not notice but i need a good friend
someone to talk to when im down down down
theres so much on my mind that i want to get out
but theres no one around

chorus
sometimes i cant help thinking what about me
some days go by that i dont even see
yeah im doing everything right and i cant break free
oh is this the way its always going to be
what about me

verse 2
well i was dreamin im on a highway with the windows down
im burning up the road at my own speed
but im stuck here going nowhere in this traffic jam
and theres a woman with her kids in the car next to me
and i swear shes singing

chorus
sometimes i cant help thinking what about me
some days go by that i dont even see
yeah im doing everything right and i cant break free
oh is this the way its always going to be
what about me
sometimes i cant help thinking what about me
some days go by that i dont even see
yeah im doing everything right and i cant break free
oh is this the way its always going to be
what about me
