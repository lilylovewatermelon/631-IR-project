we got the songs
we got the beats
we got the bar
where we used to meet
we got our names
in the concrete
on lincoln street
and we got new york
we got la
we got that rundown hotel where we stayed
we got so drunk
we jumped in the pool
slept in all day

prechorus
and when we were in it
yeah we were in it
long before we said goodbye
just for a minute
we got it right
we got it right

chorus
yeah we got the looks
we got the lights
we got the days
we got the nights
even though it ended
we got it right
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
we got tequila
we got tattoos
heart with a dagger
nothing to lose
black and white strip
from that photo booth
we thought we were cool
and now you got someone else
and i got mine
neither one of em knows that every time
they play meet virginia
im on your mind
and youre on mine girl youre on mine

prechorus
and when we were in it
yeah we were in it
long before we said goodbye
just for a minute
we got it right
we got it right

chorus
yeah we got the looks
we got the lights
we got the days
we got the nights
even though it ended
we got it right
prechorus
and when we were in it
yeah we were in it
long before we said goodbye
just for a minute
we got it right

outro
yeah we got the looks
we got the lights
we got the days
we got the nights
we got it right
we got it right
we got it rightembed"
