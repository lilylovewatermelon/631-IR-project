verse 1
youre setting off
its time to go the engines running
my mind is lost
we always knew this day was coming
and now its more frightening than its ever going to be

we grow apart
i watch you on the red horizon
your lions heart
will protect you under stormy skies
and i will always be listening for your laughter and your tears

prechorus
and as soon as i can hold you once again
i wont let go of you i swear

chorus
we lived through scars this time
but ive made up my mind
we cant leave us behind anymore

verse 2
your hands are cold
your lips are turning blue youre shaking
this fragile heart
so heavy in my chest its breaking
and in the dark you try to make a payphone call to me
see james bay liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likebut youre miles away
youre breaking up youre on your own
its hard to take
i need an hour just to say hello
but i cant make the truth of if this work out for you or me

prechorus
and for all the pennies in your pocket
we barely get a second just to speak

chorus
we lived through scars this time
but ive made up my mind
we cant leave us behind anymore

well have to hurt for now
but next time theres no doubt
cause i cant go without you anymore

bridge
oh no
oh oh oh oh
oh no oh
we get hurt

chorus
we lived through scars this time
but ive made up my mind
no we cant leave us behind anymore
well have to hurt for now
but next time theres no doubt
cause i cant go without you anymore

outro
no i cant go without you anymore24embed"
