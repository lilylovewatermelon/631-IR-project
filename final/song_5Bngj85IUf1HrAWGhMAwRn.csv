verse 1
give me shame i give you peace from underneath
give me mind and be a light to reignite
can you open up the doors to let me in
can you open up the doors to let me in

verse 2
you can put the hurt inside on top my head
as i sing the love inside from out my mouth
tell me what you need to find tell me now
tell me what you need to find

prechorus
this is a place with no shame
this is a mind with no frame
this is the light with no dark
this is the truth with no faults
this is a place with no shame
this is a mind with no frame
this is the light with no pain
this is a place with no shame
