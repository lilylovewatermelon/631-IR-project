verse 1
big bank on me bitch watch i pop shit pop

pulled a whip out the garage for the camera flicks skrrt skrrt

verse 2
so many pounds in the vicinity the room got a stench ew
way up top dont fuck with many
smoking green no not the grinch cookie
when youre gettin a lot of paper real or fake cant tell from which
put them brands on my fist and put celine on my bitch
flip the switch take a pic want that bag take a risk
i got ice live the life i got cash thats a lick
they got stripes wrong or right they gon blast with the shit
fuck the tab make em mad when i spazz they get sick
i spent a dime on the coat and bought some lines for your ho lines
put that patek out the window turn that rain into snow
i never changed only thing i left is change at the store
they know the gang they dont even ask for names where we go
from the nawf used to kick a door it was me and cho cho
from the bando now we toppin charts on billboard
for the check had to grip the tek it was me and set yeah
a nigga did a lotta shit but we aint gon speak on that shh
i dont post a lotta shit cause i dont like the internet nah
