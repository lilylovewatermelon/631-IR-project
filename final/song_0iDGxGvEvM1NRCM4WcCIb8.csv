the hacienda had once been a large one but it had been irrigated from the hills and the rеvolutions had broken all the aqueducts only a small supply of watеr was available then don ramón had had enemies in the government so that a good deal of his land was taken away to be divided among the peons now he had only some three hundred acres the two hundred acres along the lakeshore were mostly lost to him he worked a few acres of fruit land round the house and in a tiny valley just in the hills he raised sugarcane on the patches of the mountain slope little patches of maize were to be seen

but doña carlota had money she was from torreon and drew still a good income from the mines

a mozo came with a note from don ramón might he bring his wife to call on kate

doña carlota was a thin gentle wideeyed woman with a slightly startled expression and soft brownish hair she was pure european in extraction of a spanish father and french mother very different from the usual stout overpowdered oxlike mexican matron her face was pale faded and without any makeup at all her thin eager figure had something english about it but her strange wide brown eyes were not english she spoke only spanishor french but her spanish was so slow and distinct and slightly plaintive that kate understood her at once

the two women understood one another quickly but were a little nervous of one another doña carlota was delicate and sensitive like a chihuahua dog and with the same slightly prominent eyes kate felt she had rarely met a woman with such a doglike finesse of gentleness and the two women talked ramón large and muted kept himself in reserve it was as if the two women rushed together to unite against his silence and his powerful different significance

kate knew at once that doña carlota loved him but with a love that was now nearly all will she had worshipped him and she had had to leave off worshipping him she had had to question him and she would never now cease from questioning

so he sat apart a little constrained his handsome head hanging a little and his dark sensitive hands dangling between his thighs

i had such a wonderful time kate said suddenly to him i danced a dance round the drum with the men of quetzalcoatl

i heard he said with a rather stiff smile

doña carlota understood english though she would not speak it

you danced with the men of quetzalcoatl she said in spanish in a pained voice but señora why did you do such a thing oh why

i was fascinated said kate
no you must not be fascinated no no it is not good i tell you i am so sorry my husband interests himself in this thing i am so sorry

juana was bringing a bottle of vermouth all that kate had to offer her visitors in the morning

you went to see your boys in the united states said kate to doña carlota how were they

oh better thank you they are well that is the younger is very delicate

you didnt bring him home

no no i think they are better at school hereherethere are so many things to trouble them no but they will come home next month for the vacation

how nice said kate then i shall see them they will be here wont theyon the lake

welli am not sure perhaps for a little while you see i am so busy in mexico with my cuna

what is a cuna said kate she only knew it was the spanish for cradle

it turned out to be a foundlings home run by a few obscure carmelite sisters and doña carlota was the director kate gathered that don ramóns wife was an intense almost exalted catholic she exalted herself in the church and in her work for the cuna

there are so many children born in mexico said doña carlota and so many die if only we could save them and equip them for life we do a little all we can

it seemed the waste unwanted babies could be delivered in at the door of the cuna like parcels the mother had only to knock and hand in the little living bundle

it saves so many mothers from neglecting their babies and letting them die said doña carlota then we do what we can if the mother doesnt leave a name i name the child very often i do the mothers just hand over a little naked thing sometimes without a name or a rag to cover it and we never ask
the children were not all kept in the home only a small number of the others some decent indian woman was paid a small sum to take the child into her home every month she must come with the little one to the cuna to receive her wage the indians are so very rarely unkind to children careless yes but rarely rarely unkind

in former days doña carlota said nearly every wellborn lady in mexico would receive one or more of these foundlings into her home and have it brought up with the family it was the loose patriarchal generosity innate in the bosoms of the spanishmexicans but now few children were adopted instead they were taught as far as possible to be carpenters or gardeners or houseservants or among the girls dressmakers even schoolteachers

kate listened with uneasy interest she felt there was so much real human feeling in this mexican charity she was almost rebuked perhaps what doña carlota was doing was the best that could be done in this halfwild helpless country at the same time it was such a forlorn hope it made ones heart sink

and doña carlota confident as she was in her good works still had just a bit the look of a victim a gentle sensitive slightly startled victim as if some secret enemy drained her blood

don ramón sat there impassive listening without heeding solid and unmoving against the charitable quiver of his wifes emotion he let her do as she would but against her work and against her flow he was in silent heavy unchanging opposition she knew this and trembled in her nervous eagerness as she talked to kate about the cuna and won kates sympathy till it seemed to her that there was something cruel in don ramóns passive masked poise an impassive male cruelty changeless as a stone idol

now wont you come and spend the day with me while i am here with don ramón said doña carlota the house is very poor and rough it is no longer what it used to be but it is your house if you will come

kate accepted and said she would prefer to walk out it was only four miles and surely she would be safe with juana

i will send a man to come with you said don ramón it might not be quite safe

where is general viedma asked kate

we shall try to get him out when you come replied doña carlota i am so very fond of don cipriano i have known him for many years and he is the godfather of my younger son but now he is in command of the guadalajara division he is not very often able to come out

i wonder why he is a general said kate he seems to me too human

oh but he is very human too but he is a general yes yes he wants to be in command of the soldiers and i tell you he is very strong he has great power with his regiments they believe in him oh they believe in him he has that power you know that some of the higher types of indians have to make many others want to follow them and fight for them you know don cipriano is like that you can never change him but i think a woman might be wonderful for him he has lived so without any woman in his life he wont care about them

what does he care about asked kate
ah doña carlota started as if stung then she glanced quickly involuntarily at her husband as she added i dont know really i dont know

the men of quetzalcoatl said don ramón heavily with a little smile

but doña carlota seemed to be able to take all the ease and the banter out of him he seemed stiff and a bit stupid

ah there there there you have it the men of quetzalcoatlthat is a nice thing for him to care about a nice thing i say fluttered doña carlota in her gentle fragile scolding way and it was evident to kate that she adored both the men and trembled in opposition to their wrongness and would never give in to them

to ramón it was a terrible burden his wifes quivering absolute blind opposition taken in conjunction with her helpless adoration

a manservant appeared at nine oclock one morning to accompany kate to the hacienda which was called jamiltepec he had a basket and had been shopping in the market an elderly man with grey in his moustache he had bright young eyes and seemed full of energy his bare feet in the huaraches were almost black with exposure but his clothes were brilliantly white

kate was glad to be walking the one depressing thing about life in the villages was that one could not walk out into the country there was always the liability to be held up or attacked and she had walked already as far as possible in every direction in the neighbourhood of the village accompanied usually by ezequiel now she was beginning to feel a prisoner

she was glad then to be setting off the morning was clear and hot the pale brown lake quite still like a phantom people were moving on the beach in the distance tiny like dots of white white dots of men following the faint dust of donkeys she wondered often why humanity was like specks in the mexican landscape just specks of life

they passed from the lake shore to the rough dusty road going west between the steep slope of the hills and the bit of flat by the lake for almost a mile there were villas most of them shut up fast some of them smashed with broken walls and smashed windows only flowers bloomed in masses above the rubble

in the empty places were flimsy straw huts of the natives haphazard as if blown there by the road under the hill were blackgrey adobe huts like boxes and fowls running about and brown pigs or grey pigs spotted with black careered and grunted and halfnaked children dark orangebrown trotted or lay flat on their faces in the road their little naked posteriors hunched up fast asleep already asleep again

the houses were many of them being rethatched or the tiled roofs were being patched by men who assumed a great air of importance at having undertaken such a task they were pretending to hurry too because the real rains might begin any day and in the little stony levels by the lake the land was being scratchploughed by a pair of oxen and a lump of pointed wood

but this part of the road kate knew she knew the fine villa on the knoll with its tufts of palms and the laidout avenues that were laid out indeed as the dead are to crumble back again she was glad to be past the villas where the road came down to the lake again under big shady trees that had twisted wriggly beans on the left was the water the colour of turtledoves lapping the pale fawn stones at a waterhole of a stream in the beach a cluster of women were busily washing clothes in the shallows of the lake itself two women sat bathing their black hair hanging dense and wet a little farther along a man was wading slowly stopping to throw his round net skilfully upon the water then slowly stooping and gathering it in picking out the tiny glittery fish called charales strangely silent and remote everything in the gleaming morning as if it were some distant period of time

a little breeze was coming from the lake but the deep dust underfoot was hot on the right the hill rose precipitous baked and yellowish giving back the sun and the intense dryness and exhaling the faint desiccated peculiar smell of mexico that smells as if the earth had sweated itself dry

all the time strings of donkeys trotted laden through the dust their drivers stalking erect and rapid behind watching with eyes like black holes but always answering kates salute with a respectful adiós and juana echoed her laconic adiósn she was limping and she thought it horrible of kate to walk four miles when they might have struggled out in an old hired motorcar or gone in a boat or even ridden donkeyback

but to go on foot kate could hear all her criadas feelings in the drawled sardonic adiósn but the man behind strode bravely and called cheerfully his pistol was prominent in his belt

a bluff of yellow rock came jutting at the road the road wound round it and into a piece of flat open country there were fields of dry stone and hedges of dusty thorn and cactus to the left the bright green of the willows by the lakeshore to the right the hills swerved inland to meet the sheer fluted sides of dry mountains away ahead the hills curved back at the shore and a queer little crack or niche showed this crack in the hills led from don ramóns shoreproperty to the little valley where he grew the sugarcane and where the hills approached the lake again there was a dark clustering of mangotrees and the red upper storey of the hacienda house

there it is cried the man behind jamiltepec señorita la hacienda de don ramón

and his eyes shone as he said the name he was a proud peon and he really seemed happy

look how far cried juana

another time said kate i shall come alone or with ezequiel

no niña dont say so only my foot hurts this morning

yes better not to bring you

no niña i like to come very much

the tall windmill fan for drawing up water from the lake was spinning gaily a little valley came down from the niche in the hills and at the bottom a little water running towards the lake where this valley flattened out was a grove of bananaplants screened a little from the lake breeze by a vivid row of willowtrees and on the top of the slope where the road ran into the shade of mangotrees were the two rows of adobe huts like a village set a little back from the road

women were coming up between the trees on the patch from the lake with jars of water on their shoulders children were playing around the doors squatting with little naked posteriors in deep dust and here and there a goat was tethered men in soiled white clothes were lounging with folded arms and one leg crossed in front of the other against the corner of a house or crouching under the walls not by any means dolce far niente they seemed to be waiting eternally waiting for something

that way señorita called the man with the basket running to her side and indicating the smoother road sloping down between some big trees towards the white gate of the hacienda we are here

always he spoke with pleased delight as if the place were a wonderplace to him

the big doors of the zaguán the entrance stood open and in the shade of the entranceway a couple of little soldiers were seated across the cleared strawlittered space in front of the gates two peons were trotting each with a big bunch of bananas on his head the soldiers said something and the two peons halted in their trotting and slowly turned under their yellowgreen load to look back at kate and juana and the man martin approaching down the road then they turned again and trotted into the courtyard barefoot

the soldiers stood up martin trotting at kates side again ushered her into the arched entrance where the oxwagons rumbling through had worn deep ruts juana came behind making a humble noise

kate found herself in a big barren yard that seemed empty there were high walls on the three sides with sheds and stables the fourth side facing was the house with heavilybarred windows looking on to the courtyard but with no door instead there was another zaguán or passage with closed doors piercing the house

martin trotted ahead to knock on the closed doors kate stood looking round at the big yard in a shed in one corner four halfnaked men were packing bunches of bananas a man in the shade was sawing poles and two men in the sun were unloading tiles from a donkey in a corner was a bullockwagon and a pair of big blackandwhite oxen standing with heads pressed down waiting

the big doors opened and kate entered the second zaguán it was a wide entrance way with stairs going up on one side and kate lingered to look through the open iron gates in front of her down a formal garden hemmed in with huge mangotrees to the lake with its little artificial harbour where two boats were moored the lake seemed to give off a great light between the dark walls of mango

at the back of the newcomers the servant woman closed the big doors on to the yard then waved kate to the stairs

pass this way señorita

a bell tinkled above kate climbed the stone stairs and there above her was doña carlota in white muslin and with white shoes and stockings her face looking curiously yellow and faded by contrast her soft brown hair was low over her ears and she held out her thin brownish arms with queer effusiveness

so you have come and you have walked walked all the way oh imagine walking in so much sun and dust come come in and rest

she took kates hands and led her across the open terrace at the top of the stairs

it is beautiful here said kate

she stood on the terrace looking out past the mangotrees at the lake a distant sailingcanoe was going down the breeze on the pallid unreal water away across rose the bluish grooved mountains with the white speck of a village far away in the morning it seemed in another world in another life in another mode of time

what is that village kate asked

that one that one there it is san ildefonso said doña carlota in her fluttering eagerness

but it is beautiful here kate repeated

hermososí sí bonito quavered the other woman uneasily always answering in spanish

the house reddish and yellow in colour had two short wings towards the lake the terrace with green plants on the terrace wall went round the three sides the roof above supported by big square pillars that rose from the ground down below the pillars made a sort of cloisters around the three sides and in the little stone court was a pool of water beyond the rather neglected formal garden with strong sun and deep mangoshade

come you will need to rest said doña carlota

i would like to change my shoes said kate

she was shown into a high simple rather bare bedroom with redtiled floor there she changed into the shoes and stockings juana had carried and rested a little

as she lay resting she heard the dulled thudthud of the tomtom drum but save the crowing of a cock in the distance no other sound on the bright yet curiously hollow mexican morning and the drum thudding with its dulled black insistence made her uneasy it sounded like something coming over the horizon

she rose and went into the long high salon where doña carlota was sitting talking to a man in black the salon with its three windowdoors open on to the terrace its worn red floor tiled with old square bricks its high walls colourwashed a faint green and the manybeamed ceiling whitewashed and with its bareness of furniture seemed like part of the outofdoors like some gardenarbour put for shade the sense which houses have in hot climates of being just three walls wherein one lingers for a moment then goes away again

as kate entered the room the man in black rose and shook hands with doña carlota bowing very low and deferential then with a deferential sideways sort of bow to kate he vanished out of doors

come said doña carlota to kate are you sure now you are rested and she pulled forward one of the cane rockingchairs that had poised itself in the room en route to nowhere

perfectly said kate how still it seems here except for the drum perhaps it is the drum that makes it seem so still though i always think the lake makes a sort of silence

ah the drum cried doña carlota lifting her hand with a gesture of nervous spent exasperation i cannot hear it no i cannot i cannot bear to hear it

and she rocked herself in a sudden access of agitation

it does hit one rather below the belt said kate what is it

ah do not ask me it is my husband

she made a gesture of despair and rocked herself almost into unconsciousness

is don ramón drumming

drumming doña carlota seemed to start no oh no he is not drumming himself he brought down two indians from the north to do that

did he said kate noncommittal

but doña carlota was rocking in a sort of semiconsciousness then she seemed to pull herself together

i must talk to somebody i must she said suddenly straightening herself in her chair her face creamy and creased her soft brown hair sagging over her ears her brown eyes oddly desperate may i talk to you

do said kate rather uneasy

you know what ramón is doing she said looking at kate almost furtively suspiciously

does he want to bring back the old gods said kate vaguely

ah cried doña carlota again with that desperate flying jerk of her hand as if it were possible as if it were possible the old gods imagine it señora the old gods why what are they nothing but dead illusions and ugly repulsive illusions ah i always thought my husband such a clever man so superior to me ah it is terrible to have to change ones idea this is such nonsense how dare he how dare he take such nonsense seriously how does he dare

does he believe in it himself asked kate

himself but señora and doña carlota gave a pitiful pitying smile of contempt how could he as if it were possible after all he is an educated man how could he believe in such nonsense

then why does he do it

why why there was a tone of unspeakable weariness in doña carlotas voice i wish i knew i think he has gone insane as mexicans do insane like francisco villa the bandit

kate thought of the pugfaced notorious pancho villa in wonder unable to connect him with don ramón

all the mexicans as soon as they rise above themselves go that way said doña carlota their pride gets the better of them and then they understand nothing nothing but their own foolish will their will to be very very important it is just the male vanity dont you think señora that the beginning and the end of a man is his vanity dont you think it was just against this danger that christ came to teach men a proper humility to teach them the sin of pride but that is why they hate christ so much and his teaching first and last they want their own vanity

kate had often thought so herself her own final conclusion about men was that they were the vanity of vanities nothing but vanity they must be flattered and made to feel great nothing else

and now my husband wants to go to the other extreme of jesus he wants to exalt pride and vanity higher than god ah it is terrible terrible and foolish like a little boy ah what is a man but a little boy who needs a nurse and a mother ah señora i cant bear it

doña carlota covered her face with her hand as if swooning

but there is something wonderful too about don ramón said kate coaxingly though at the moment she hated him

wonderful ah yes he has gifts he has great gifts but what are gifts to a man who perverts them

tell me what you think he really wants said kate

power just power just foolish wicked power as if there had not been enough horrible wicked power let loose in this country but hehewants to be beyond them all hehehe wants to be worshipped to be worshipped to be worshipped a god he whom ive held ive held in my arms he is a child as all men are children and now he wantsto be worshipped she went off into a shrill wild laughter covering her face with her hands and laughing shrilly her laughter punctuated by hollow ghastly sobs

kate sat in absolute dismay waiting for the other woman to recover herself she felt cold against these hysterics and exerted all her heavy female will to stop them

after all she said when doña carlota became quiet her face in her hands it isnt your fault we cant be responsible even for our husbands i know that since my husband died and i couldnt prevent him dying and thenthen i learned that no matter how you love another person you cant really do anything you are helpless when it comes to the last things you have to leave them to themselves when they want to die or when they want to do things that seem foolish so so foolish to a woman

doña carlota looked up at the other woman

you loved your husband very muchand he died she said softly

i did love him and i shall never never love another man i couldnt ive lost the power

and why did he die

ah even that was really his own fault he broke his own soul and spirit in those irish politics i knew it was wrong what does ireland matter what does nationalism and all that rubbish matter really and revolutions they are so so stupid and vieux jeu ah it would have been so much better if joachim had been content to live his life in peace with me it could be so jolly so lovely and i tried and tried and tried with him but it was no good he wanted to kill himself with that beastly irish business and i tried in vain to prevent him

doña carlota stared slowly at kate

as a woman must try to prevent a man when he is going wrong she said as i try to prevent ramón as he will get himself killed as surely as they all do down to francisco villa and when they are dead what good is it all

when they are dead said kate then you know its no good

you do oh señora if you think you can help me with ramón do help me do for it means the death either of me or him and i shall die though he is wrong unless he gets killed

tell me what he wants to do said kate what does he think he wants to do anyhowlike my husband thought he wanted to make a free ireland and a great irish people but i knew all the time the irish arent a great people any more and you cant make them free they are only good at destroyingjust mere stupid destroying how can you make a people free if they arent free if something inside them compels them to go on destroying

i know i know and that is ramón he wants to destroy even jesus and the blessed virgin for this people imagine it to destroy jesus and the blessed virgin the last thing theyve got

but what does he say himself that he wants to do

he says he wants to make a new connection between the people and god he says himself god is always god but man loses his connection with god and then he can never recover it again unless some new saviour comes to give him his new connection and every new connection is different from the last though god is always god and now ramón says the people have lost god and the saviour cannot lead them to him any more there must be a new saviour with a new vision but ah señora that is not true for me god is love and if ramón would only submit to love he would know that he had found god but he is perverse ah if we could be together quietly loving and enjoying the beautiful world and waiting in the love of god ah señora why why why cant he see it oh why cant he see it instead of doing all these

the tears came to doña carlotas eyes and spilled over her cheeks kate also was in tears mopping her face

its no good she said sobbing i know its no good no matter what we do they dont want to be happy and peaceful they want this strife and these other false horrible connections its no good whatever we do thats whats so bitter so bitter

the two women sat in their bentwood rockingchairs and just sobbed and as they sobbed they heard a step coming along the terrace the faint swish of the sandals of the people

it was don ramón drawn unconsciously by the emotional disturbance of the two women

doña carlota hastily dabbed her eyes and her sniffing nose kate blew her nose like a trumpet and don ramón stood in the doorway

he was dressed in white dazzling in the costume of the peons the white blouse jacket and the white wide pantaloon trousers but the white was linen slightly starched and brilliant almost unnatural in its whiteness from under his blouse in front hung the ends of a narrow woollen sash white with blue and black bars and a fringe of scarlet and on his naked feet were the plaited huaraches of blue and black strips of leather with thick reddyed soles his loose trousers were bound round the ankles with blue red and black woollen braids

kate glanced at him as he stood in the sun so dazzingly white that his black hair and dark face looked like a hole in the atmosphere he came forward the ends of his sash swinging against his thighs his sandals slightly swishing

i am pleased to see you he said shaking hands with kate how did you come

he dropped into a chair and sat quite still the two women hung their heads hiding their faces the presence of the man seemed to put their emotion out of joint he ignored all the signs of their discomfort overlooking it with a powerful will there was a certain strength in his presence they all cheered up a bit

you didnt know my husband had become one of the peoplea real peona señor peon like count tolstoy became a señor moujik said doña carlota with an attempt at raillery

anyway it suits him said kate

there said don ramón give the devil his dues

but there was something unyielding unbending about him he laughed and spoke to the women only from a surface self underneath powerful and inscrutable he made no connection with them

so it was at lunch there was a flitting conversation with intervals of silence it was evident that ramón was thinking in another world in the silence and the ponderous stillness of his will working in another sphere made the women feel overshadowed

the señora is like me ramón said doña carlota she cannot bear the sound of that drum must it play any more this afternoon

there was a moments pause before he answered

after four oclock only

must we have that noise today carlota persisted

why not today like other days he said but a certain darkness was on his brow and it was evident he wanted to leave the presence of the two women

because the señora is here and i am here and we neither of us like it and tomorrow the señora will not be here and i shall be gone back to mexico so why not spare us today surely you can show us this consideration

ramón looked at her and then at kate there was anger in his eyes and kate could almost feel in his powerful chest the big heart swelling with a suffocation of anger both women kept mum but it pleased them anyhow that they could make him angry

why not row with mrs leslie on the lake he said with quiet control

but under his dark brows was a level indignant anger

we may not want to said carlota

then he did what kate had not known anyone to do before he withdrew his consciousness away from them as they all three sat at table leaving the two women as it were seated outside a closed door with nothing more happening kate felt for the time startled and forlorn then a slow anger burned in her warm ivory cheek

oh yes she said i can start home before then

no no said doña carlota with a spanish wail dont leave me stay with me till evening and help me to amuse don cipriano he is coming to supperembed"
