once was a time you and i
made a promise til the day we die
i trusted each and every word
never thinking that id get burned
silly me i believed in your fairy tales
boy i thought that i knew you so very well
but you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried
and it cuts like a knife

chorus
its the last time youre ever gonna kiss these lips
or ever will deceive these eyes
believe me when i tell you this
baby boy its the last time
im ever gonna cry these tears
im never gonna hear your lies
so listen while i make it clear
in case you didnt hear
this times the last time theres no time to give it one more try
theres only time to say goodbye

verse 2
fool me once shame on you
fool me twice now this song is through
the things you said i can never forget
the things you did fill my heart with regret
but im still standing tall as i walk away
and youll know that its true when you hear me say
its over its through
aint a thing you can do boy
its sad but its true
