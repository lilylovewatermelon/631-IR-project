i will take good care of you i will take good care of you
everything you feel is good if you would only let you
i will wash your hair at night and dry it off with care
i will see your body bare and still i will live here

chorus
so stay with me hold my hand
theres no need to be brave

verse 2
and all the quiet nights you bear seal them up with care
no one needs to know theyre there for i will hold them for you

bridge
cause all i ever wanted is here all i ever wanted
all i want is always you its always you

prechorus
and were not out of the tunnel
i bet you though theres an end

chorus
stay with me hold my hand
theres no need to be brave
and while you sleep ill be scared
so by the time you wake ill be brave
