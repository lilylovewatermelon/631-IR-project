verse
from all eyes the land disappears
all that is left is is a hollow leg of tears
from her smile the golden tooth is won
child your only hope has flown
all gone to this house
all i have left is the only place ive been

chorus
its all heart and lungs
its not that much fun
its hard hard to run
its not that much fun
its all heart and lungs
its not that much fun
its allyou might also likeembed"
