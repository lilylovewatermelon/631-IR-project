i see a red door and i want it painted black
no colors anymore i want them to turn black
i see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
i have to turn my head until my darkness goes

verse 2
i see a line of cars and they are painted black
with flowers and my love both never to come back
i see people turn their heads and quickly look away
like a newborn baby it just happens every day

verse 3
i look inside myself and see my heart is black
i see my red door and its heading into black
maybe then ill fade away and not have to face the facts
its not easy facing up when your whole world is black

bridge 1
i wanna see it painted painted painted black oh baby
i wanna see it painted painted painted black oh baby

verse 4
no more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
i could not foresee this thing happening to you
if i look hard enough into the setting sun
my love will laugh with me before the morning comes

i wanna see it painted painted painted black
oh black as night black as coal
i wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

outro
painted painted painted black oh baby
painted painted painted blackembed"
