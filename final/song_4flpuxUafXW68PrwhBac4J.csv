i should be out in that driveway stopping you
tears should be rolling down my cheek
and i dont know why im not falling apart
like i usually do
and how the thought of losing yous not killing me
i feel bad

chorus
that i can stand here strong
cold as stone seems so wrong
i cant explain it
maybe its just
ive cried so much
im tired and im numb baby i hate it
i feel bad that i dont feel bad

verse 2
i can let myself be angry over wasted time
and sad about just throwing love away
yeah i almost wish my heart was breaking
but i cant lie
all i want to do is turn the page
i feel bad

chorus
that i can stand here strong
cold as stone seems so wrong
i cant explain it
maybe its just
ive cried so much
im tired and im numb baby i hate it
i feel bad
you might also likeoutro
that i dont feel bitter alone
i just feel its time its time to move on
i just gotta move on and on and on and on
yeah
baby its just ive cried so much
im tired and im numb baby i hate it
i feel bad that i dont feel bad
no i dont feel bad2embed"
