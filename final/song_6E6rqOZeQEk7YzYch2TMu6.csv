he asked me for a dollar i said go get a job
i turned up my collar and started walking off
he said i dont blame you i know what you think
id just spend your money to buy another drink

chorus
but you dont know jack
double shot eighty proof on the rocks
until youve lost it all
and you cant go back
to your life and your kids and your exwife
with just a telephone call
if you think its just a bottle
in an old brown paper sack
you dont know jack

verse 2
he showed me a picture of two little girls
wearing easter dresses hair done up in curls
he said god bless their mamma
she said i couldnt stay
and buddy if youre wondering
how could i throw it all away

chorus
you dont know jack
double shot eighty proof on the rocks
until youve lost it all
and you cant go back
to your life and your kids and your exwife
with just a telephone call
if you think its just a bottle
in an old brown paper sack
you dont know jack
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 3
if you never felt the fire
running through your veins
if youve never seen the devil
face to face

chorus
you dont know jack
double shot eighty proof on the rocks
until youve lost it all
so brother just be glad and tonight
hold your kids kiss your wife
and when you talk to god
count up all your blessings
and thank the good lord that
you dont know jack
you dont know jack4embed"
