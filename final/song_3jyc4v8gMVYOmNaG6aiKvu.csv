it could be a black dress
high heels
ripped up torn up lucky jeans
or the covers in the morning
her boyshorts and my favorite tee
unbuttoned flannel layin on the floor
lingerie hangin on the back of the door
i swear it dont matter what it is

chorus
she puts it on like it was made for her
the kind of thing you cant teach or learn
she puts it on on a friday night
everything she does she does just right
it wont take long til you cant say no
she walks in shes gonna steal the show
she puts it on and on and on and on
cause she knows she can pull it off
aw yeah

verse 2
the way she wears my flatbill way better than me
got me wanting everything underneath
those blue eyes lookin back at me
looks like that can change everything
i swear
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likechorus
she puts it on like it was made for her
the kind of thing you cant teach or learn
she puts it on on a friday night
everything she does she does just right
it wont take long til you cant say no
she walks in shes gonna steal the show
she puts it on and on and on and on
cause she knows she can pull it off woo
yeah she knows she can pull it off

bridge
unbuttoned flannel layin on the floor
lingerie hangin on the back of the door
i swear it dont matter what it is

chorus
she puts it on like it was made for her
the kind of thing you dont teach or learn
she puts it on on a friday night
everything she does she does it right
it wont take long til you cant say no
she walks in shes gonna steal the show
she puts it on and on and on and on
cause she knows she can pull it off woo
yeah she knows she can pull it off
cause she knows she can pull it off
yeah she puts it on and on and on and on
cause she knows she can pull it offembed"
