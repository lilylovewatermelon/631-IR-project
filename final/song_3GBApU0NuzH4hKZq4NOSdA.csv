in a few weeks i will get time
to realise its right before my eyes
and i can take it if its what i want to do
i am leaving and this is starting
to feel like its right before my eyes
and i can taste it its my sweet beginning

chorus
and i can tell just what you want
you dont want to be alone
you dont want to be alone
and i cant say its what you know
but youve known it the whole time
yeah youve known it the whole time

verse 2
maybe next year ill have no time
to think about the questions to address
am i the one to try to stop the fire
i wouldnt test you im not the best you
could have obtained why try anything
i will get there just remember i know

chorus
and i can tell just what you want
you dont want to be alone
you dont want to be alone
and i cant say its what you know
but youve known it the whole time
