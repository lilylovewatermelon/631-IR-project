a note by the door
simply explains its all that remains
its no wonder why i have not slept in days
the dust on the floor
piled up from the years all those scars and souvenirs
now that youre gone its easy to see
but so hard to believe

chorus tyler connolly  chris daughtry
by the way
you left without saying goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me you and me

verse 2 tyler connolly with chris daughtry
its not like before
you left nothing here its all disappeared
it hurts me to see that weve been a lie
would it have hurt you to try

chorus tyler connolly  chris daughtry
by the way
you left without saying goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me you and me

its sad to say that this pain is killing me inside
but its time to say that this pain is keeping me alive
twisting and turning it rips through my heart
its been tearing me apart

chorus tyler connolly  chris daughtry
by the way
you left without saying goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me you and me

outro chris daughtry  tyler connolly both
you and me yeah
all i think about now is you and me you and me
you and me yeah
all i think about now is you and me
you and me yeah
