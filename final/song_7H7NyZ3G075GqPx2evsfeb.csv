verse 1
spend some time away
getting ready for the day youre born again
spend some time alone
understand that soon youll run with better men
alone again

chorus
alone again
alone again
alone again
alone

verse 2
no use looking out
its within that brings that lonely feeling
understand that when you leave here
youll be clear among the better men
alone again

chorus
alone again
alone again
alone again
alone
alone again
alone again
alone again
