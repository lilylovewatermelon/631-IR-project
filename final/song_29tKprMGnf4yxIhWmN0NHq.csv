sometimes i wonder who the fuck i am
sometimes i wonder who the fuck i am
uh
yeah want you to feel it
man my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
i want you all to feel it yeah
so step up on the mic and uh
show em what you got tiger
aight look

verse 1 mac miller
uh sometimes i wonder who the fuck i am
so ive been lookin in the mirror and it still dont make no sense
im askin what am i supposed to do
done so much in my short lifetime but i havent done shit
i done flew around the whole world
first i shook a million hands then i took a million pictures
but im a hostage in my own world
yeah my thoughts my own enemy got no time for these bitches
i got too much on my damn mind
so if i add some more stress i just dont see how ima cope
i think they underestimate the grind
i do to bring this dough and im only 20 years old
i wonder why i sip this devil juice cause it feel incredible
you might also likerefrain mac miller
problems i got several
thank god that none of that medical
uh ive been blessed with much to be expected

chorus mac miller
what am i doing here
i wonder what am i doing here
what am i doing here uh
what am i doing here

verse 2 mac miller
i hope this feelin last for fuckin ever
i dont wanna come back down let me stay above the ground
i hope i do what i was meant to do
cause ive been searchin for that answer i just hope i get it now
please let me find euphoria
when you up above the clouds like who gon touch me now
and do we ever get to know the truth
cause everybody seems to have it but to me it seems they lack it
now im rollin and im sippin lean
sometimes i catch a buzz just to help me picture love
drinkin liquor and im smokin weed
and you dont ever do too much if you could never do enough
wonder why its me instead of you ill be there to rescue you
refrain mac miller
problems you got several
thank god that none of that medical
uh ive been blessed with much to be expected

chorus mac miller
what am i doing here
i wonder what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here

verse 3 lil wayne
uh sittin in my bentley  thinkin bout these hoes
all i do is kill em i kill em like nicole
simpson flag crimson smoke em like winstons
i just bought a new chopper i treat it like an infant
im lightin up a stogie its longer than a hoagie
situations gettin fishy and i dont eat anchovies
fuck the world kill em all she answer when i call
if the cops pull us over she gon hide it in her drawers
see i come from a place where stars never shine
and drama is accepted credit cards are declined
everybody gotta die but i aint everybody
if that ho play with me i whoop that chick like terrence howard
im a pimp i aint lyin but that is not important
im just tryna buy time but cant really afford it
sayin aint that a bitch but i hope that bitch is bad
i feel like money in the trash like
chorus mac miller  lil wayne
what am i doing here whoa
i wonder what am i doing here yeah young mula baby
what am i doing here
what am i doing here
