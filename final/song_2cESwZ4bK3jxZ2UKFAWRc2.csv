in the fights they had hed cover up his ears
thought big boys dont cry fought back all the tears
mama had use her makeup to hide the bruises on his face
in the morning theyd pretend that thered never ever been a trace
his old man woke him up to help him find the car
take the bus uptown outside some rundown bar
and swore that he was quitting
and then hed start to cry
and though the boy knew the truth
sometimes hed still believe that lie

verse 2
when the sins of the father are the sins of the son
all you do is crawl when you want to run
and god gave boys their mamas cause
they always see their promise
and they help them understand
how to walk like a man
walk like a man

verse 3
they moved a lot of places they never settled down
it got pretty old being the new kid in town
he always told his friends my daddys sick today
said hed be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his mama say
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 4
the sins of the father are the sins of the son
crawl before you walk boy
walk before you run
come on stand up straight im proud of you
take my hand
i know you can
walk like a man
walk like a man

verse 5
your daddys demons are calling your name
dont you listen to them cause theyve got no claim
temptations may come that isnâ€™t no sin
you get stronger every time that you dont give in

verse 6
the sins of the father are the sins of the son
you cant undo what has been done
youll have to retrace his footsteps
through the sand
and pray you find the love of a girl
and take her by the hand
and walk on
walk like a manembed"
