one word thats all you said
something in your voice called me turned my head
your smile just captured me
you were in my future as far as i could see
and i don’t know how it happens but it happens still
you asked me if i love you if i always will

chorus
well you had me from hello
i felt love start to grow
the moment i looked into your eyes you won me
it was over from the start you completely stole my heart
and now you wont let go
i never even had a chance you know
you had me from hello

verse 2
inside i built a wall
so high around my heart i thought id never fall
one touch you brought it down
the bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
and i swore to me i wasnt going to love again
the last time was the last time id let someone in

chorus
but you had me from hello
i felt love start to grow
the moment i looked into your eyes you won me
it was over from the start you completely stole my heart
and now you won’t let go
i never even had a chance you know
you had me from hello
