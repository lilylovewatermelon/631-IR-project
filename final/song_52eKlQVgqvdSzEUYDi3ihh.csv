they are sick they are poor
and they die by the thousands and we look away
they are wolves at the door
and theyre not gonna move us or get in our way

chorus 1
cause we dont have the time
here at the top of the world
feeling alright
here at the top of the world

postchorus
we hold our own
by keeping our hearts cold

verse 2
different god darker skin
they are just not a burden that wed like to bear
they are living in sin
there are so many reasons for us not to care

chorus 2
but im feeling alright
here at the top of the world
doing just fine
here at the top of the world
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
weve learned money matters most
so we keep our cards held close
here at the top of the world
we hold our own
by keeping our hearts cold
and weve learned what matters most
so we keep our hearts cold

outro
they are no one
they are nowhere
they are not our problem
not worth saving
nonexistent if we keep our hearts cold
they are no one
they are nowhereembed"
