in my minds eye you throw wickedness at me
im just a toy to you i bring no real joy to you
the way i see it you dont want me here no more
you want a hole in my forehead and blood pourin on the floor
cause im so dirty fuckin dirty and shoddy
i want up out of this body thats hated by everybody
sometimes i dont know why i continue to try
its so much easier to die than to get by
and to get by and to get by

verse 2 violent j
if im gonna die im taking you with me
get you and get me we can be bloody
if im gonna fly im gonna succeed
take you and get me we can be bloody
sometimes i dont know why i continue to try
its so much easier to die than to get by
and to get by and to get by
and to get by
and to get by
and to get by
and to get by

verse 3 shaggy 2 dope
i dont wanna leave my house
dont wanna open my mouth
dont wanna read my mail
dont wanna meet with pals
i dont wanna fuck shit up
dont wanna fuckin get up
dont wanna take up space
dont want your time to waste
i dont wanna fight this back
just wanna fade to black
dont wanna turn to faith
i wanna burn at stakes
i dont wanna build my life
i wanna bloody my knife
dont wanna grab the phone
dont wanna leave this room
i dont wanna talk with you
im fuckin stalkin you
dont wanna fix myself
i wanna nix myself
i dont wanna try to change
just wanna fry my brains
dont wanna slow shit down
i wanna throw shit around
i dont wanna run nowhere
dont want no one to care
dont want another crack at it
id rather be a crack addict
i dont wanna look for help
dont wanna help myself
i dont wanna even try to get by to get by to get by to get by
get by
and to get by
and to get by
and to get by
