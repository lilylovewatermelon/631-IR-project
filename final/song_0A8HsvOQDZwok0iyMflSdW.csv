i was alone a lot
mostly observing things
like hyenas and migrations
and who cares
now i have all these friends
im never by myself
i mean look at all those people downstairs

aaron spoken
uhhuh

cady
more is always better
more people know my name
i have more shoes
more is always better
cause when you have less
you have more to lose
wait that’s confusing

aaron
see i dont mind alone
sometimes alone is good
‘cause time to think is in short supply
you might also likecady
you havent been alone
try kenya with one phone
almost no people
just like animals and sky
do you know what i had more of
stars
so many stars at night
but here theres so much light
i see them less now
plus im always cold because the airconditioned air
though in fairness that could be how i dress now
whatever i look cuter
it worked like pretending i needed a tutor

aaron spoken
pretending

cady spoken
yeah i pretended to be bad at math to get you to talk to me

aaron spoken
why didn’t you just talk to me
cady spoken
because of regina because you were her property…

aaron spoken
her property

cady spoken
no shut up not property…

aaron spoken
don’t tell me to shut up
you are like a clone of regina

cady spoken
no

sung
i am more and i am better
and no one likes you more
not anyone not her

more is always better
dont look at me that way
what girl would you prefer

aaron
i would prefer the girl you were
not who youre trying to be
you think this works with me
well you thought wrong
looking at this place
i see you trying to erase
what is best about yourself just to belong

you say more is always better
but there is less of you than there was before
so if more is always better
then you should have thought it through a bit more

cady
i should have thought it through a bit…
you know what i had more of
stars…1embed"
