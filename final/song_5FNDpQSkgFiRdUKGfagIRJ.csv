you should be stronger than me
you been here seven years longer than me
dont you know you supposed to be the man
not pale in comparison to who you think i am
you always wanna talk it through i dont care
i always have to comfort you when im there
but thats what i need you to do stroke my hair

chorus
cause ive forgotten all of young loves joy
feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

verse 2
you should be stronger than me
but instead youre longer than frozen turkey
whyd you always put me in control
all i need is for my man to live up to his role
always wanna talk it through im okay
always have to comfort you every day
but thats what i need you to do are you gay

chorus
cause ive forgotten all of young loves joy
feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

he said the respect i made you earn
thought you had so many lessons to learn
i said you dont know what love is get a grip
sound as if youre reading from some other tired script
im not gonna meet your mother anytime
i just wanna grip your body over mine
please tell me why you think thats a crime

chorus
ive forgotten all of young loves joy
feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

outro
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me
you should be stronger than me3embed"
