ive been holding my breath
ive  been counting to ten
over  something you said
ive been holding back tears
while youre throwing back beers
im  alone in bed

you  know i im afraid of change
guess thats why we stay the same

ill pack my bags get on the road
find someone that loves you
better than i do darling i know
cause  you remind me every day
im not enough but i still stay
