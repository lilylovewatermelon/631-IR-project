im so close to you baby but im so far away
theres a silence between us and theres so much to say
youre my strength youre my weakness youre my faith youre my doubt
we gotta meet in the middle to work this thing out

chorus
more love
i can hear our hearts cryin
more love
i know thats all we need
more love
to flow in between us
to take us and hold us
and lift us above
if theres ever an answer
its more love

verse 2
were afraid to be idle
so we fill up the days
we run on the treadmill
keep slavin away
til theres no time for talkin
bout trouble in mind
and the doors are all closed
between your heart and mine

more love
i know thats all we need
more love
to flow in between us
to take us and hold us

interlude

verse 3
just look out around us
people fightin their wars
they think theyll be happy
when theyve settled their scores
lets lay down our weapons
that pulled us apart
be still for just a minute
try to open our hearts

chorus
more love
i can hear our hearts cryin
more love
i know thats all we need
more love
to flow in between us
to take us and hold us
and lift us above
if theres ever an answer
its more love
i can hear our hearts cryin
more love
i know thats all we need
more love
to flow in between us
to take us and hold us
and lift us above
if theres ever an answer
its more love
outro
