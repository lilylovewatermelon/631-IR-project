oh this is the end of everything that ive known
oh this is the end of everything that ive known
so come on

verse 1
yo white boy on the beat rockin gucci sneaks
aaaall i do is win chchchcharlie sheen
started out in 06 and revived the scene uh
so many motherfuckers wanna be like me
cacame from the lowest of lows rose to the top with a vision
my haters talkin shit while washin dishes for a livin
fuck you bitches im a business ill be kissin on your misses
what you spend in fifteen months is what i spend in fifteen minutes

prechorus
oh dont give a fuck about you
youre feelin froggy motherfucker
aint a damn thing you can do
youre a bitch youre a punk
dont make me pull the pump
cock it back and leave you slumped
now thats what i call bad luck

chorus
oh this is the end of everything that ive known
no way of knowing if ill ever be home
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
oh and if i try to make it out of this town
no way of knowing if ill ever be found
i dont ever wanna be alone alone

i got a lotta people talkin nothin but chatter
whwhwhyd you switch your style up
and that i dont matter
man ive been in rap since i was shittin in pampers
climbed the ladder to the top and now im shittin on rappers
aaaall i do is work straight up hustle and grind
so many people mad at me for crossin the line
iii find it kinda funny the shit you say in your tweets
but when were facetoface you aint got nothin to say to me

prechorus
oh so fuck you too
you better take a step back before i call up the crew
you talk a lotta shit but you spread nothin but lies
you keep on runnin your mouth you better open your eyes

chorus
oh this is the end of everything that ive known
no way of knowing if ill ever be home
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
oh and if i try to make it out of this town
no way of knowing if ill ever be found
i dont ever wanna be alone alone

im on that next girl loves sex
no doubt im on top of the world break your neck
so break your motherfuckin neck
im on that wreck fly like a jet
switchin my lanes like im racin a vet
im on that next girl loves sex
no doubt im on top of the world break your neck
im on that next girl loves sex
no doubt im on top of the world
so break your motherfuckin neck
chorus
oh this is the end of everything that ive known
no way of knowing if ill ever be home
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
oh and if i try to make it out of this town
no way of knowing if ill ever be found
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
oh this is the end of everything that ive known
no way of knowing if ill ever be home
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
oh and if i try to make it out of this town
no way of knowing if ill ever be found
i dont ever wanna be alone alone
