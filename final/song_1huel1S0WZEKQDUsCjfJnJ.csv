well here i stand before myself
and i see somethings out of place
you tasted all my purity
and now theres nothing left to waste

prechorus
the feeling gets so in my way
its getting lost in my delivery
the feeling gets so in my way
im getting lost in your periphery

chorus
then you sold me up the river again
i dont wanna be alone again
and you made me start all over again
i dont wanna be alone again
you moved me and soothed me then you fought me
i dont wanna be alone again
and you left me wondering
what the hell
what is wrong with me

verse 2
i never felt like i had failed
until the day you came undone
i never felt like i was lost
until the day you killed me again

the feeling gets so in my way
its getting lost in my delivery

chorus
then you sold me up the river again
i dont wanna be alone again
and you made me start it over again
i dont wanna be alone again
you moved me and soothed me then you fought me
i dont wanna be alone again
and you left me wondering
what the hell
what is wrong with me

bridge
are you stronger
for cutting me open
are you stronger
for leaving me broken

chorus
and you sold me up the river again
i dont wanna be alone again
and you made me start it over again
i dont wanna be alone again
and you moved me and you soothed me and you fought me
i dont wanna be alone again
and you left me wondering
what the hell
what is wrong with me1embed"
