neon shines through smoky eyes tonight
its 2 am im drunk again its heavy on my mind
i could never love again so much as i love you
where you end where i begin is like a river going through
take my eyes take my heart i need them no more
if never again they fall upon the one i so adore

chorus
excuse me please one more drink
could make it strong cause i dont need to think
she broke my heart my grace is gone
one more drink and ill move on

verse 2
one drink to remember then another to forget
how could i ever dream to find sweet love like you again
one drink to remember and another to forget

chorus
excuse me please one more drink
could make it strong cause i dont need to think
she broke my heart my grace is gone
one more drink and ill move on
one more drink and ill be gone

you think of things impossible and the sun refuse to shine
i woke with you beside me your cold hand lay in mine

chorus
excuse me please one more drink
could make it strong because i dont need to think
she broke my heart my grace is gone
one more drink and ill go
excuse me please one more drink
could make it strong because i dont need to think
she broke my heart my grace is gone

outro
one more drink and ill move on
one more drink and ill be gone
one more drink my grace is gone3embed"
