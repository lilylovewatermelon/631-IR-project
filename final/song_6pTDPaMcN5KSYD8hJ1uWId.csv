i wonder why i get paranoid when im high
i wonder why i say yes to everyone in my life
i wonder why i cant run that fast in my dreams
i wonder why i feel short when i know my moneys tall
i wonder why i miss everyone and i still dont call
i wonder why i cant run that fast in my dreams

although i guess if i knew tomorrow
i guess i wouldnt need faith
i guess if i never fell
i guess i wouldnt need grace
i guess if i knew his plans
i guess he wouldnt be god god god

maybe thats okay maybe thats okay
maybe i dont know maybe i dont know
but maybe thats okay

verse 2
i wonder why i feel emptiness and i sing these blues
i wonder why i feel hopelessness when i watch the news
i wonder why i cant find my voice in my dreams
i wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
i wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
i wonder why i cant find my voice in my dreams
