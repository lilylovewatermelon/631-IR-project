chorus
ayy i sip the lean in the car
my shooter rock out like guitars
take his girl and im breaking her heart
me and gabe we be shining like stars
smoking dope i dont fuck with the bars
i think i landed on mars
they be hating cause we living large
ayy i sip the lean in the car
my shooter rock out like guitars
take his girl and im breaking her heart
me and gabe we be shining like stars
smoking dope i dont fuck with the bars
i think i landed on mars
they be hating cause we living large

postchorus
ayy why you hating on me
it is so easy to see
showing signs of jealousy
and i know its not meant to be
cause you turned to a memory
and you said you was down to ride
but now youre my enemy

getting money im gone on a chase
fuck a ho i be stacking my cake
im no hero they gave me the cape
first place when i finish the race
in her room and she giving me face
when i nut she gon give me my space
you a lame so you cannot relate
hittin licks had to hide from the jakes
crack the code then i open the safe
get my money then go out the way
charged up i feel like triplea
think she loyal im fucking your bae
let em talk i dont care what they say
niggas pussy be riding my wave
aint my nigga then get off the stage
kick that boy in his shit johnny cage
pompom ass nigga
ol uncle tom ass niggas
boy i dont wanna take a picture
all these niggas talking all on twitter
talkin bout pulling up with hitters
you a goofy just look at your image
im in the game like a scrimmage
stack it up i cant let it diminish
chorus
ayy i sip the lean in the car
my shooter rock out like guitars
take his girl and im breaking her heart
me and gabe we be shining like stars
smoking dope i dont fuck with the bars
i think i landed on mars
they be hating cause we living large

postchorus
ayy why you hating on me
it is so easy to see
showing signs of jealousy
and i know its not meant to be
cause you turned to a memory
and you said you was down to ride
but now youre my enemy

verse 2
ayy and now youre my enemy
you said you was down to ride
but youre not a friend of me
in the game like a referee
im just getting whats meant for me
and they love to hate all the time
but these niggas pressed on me
and they tryna copy the swag
but they cannot get it from me
in the kitchen with recipes
money long like a centipede
i got up and got it on my own
be faded with destiny
and ima go get all the money
and do this for my family23embed"
