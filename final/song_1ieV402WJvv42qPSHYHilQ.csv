theyre slipping through our fingers but were ready to fly
the nightll be our cover and well huddle below
we got the music in our bodies and the radio

and when the morning arrives itll all be gone
disappearing in to the crack of dawn
we better make our move now before the sun is awake
its time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace

and i dont want to let another minute get by
love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky
we may be running out of night but never running out of steam
were acting on a hunch and well be acting out a dream

there really isnt any time to lose
theyre going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
youre such a pretty boy
let me show you what to do and youll do it
but you gotta move faster
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
its all we ever wanted
and all well ever need
and its slipping through our fingers
faster than the speed of night

faster than the speed of night
its all we ever wanted
and all well ever need
and its slipping through our fingers
faster than the speed of night

faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night

let me show you how to drive me crazy
let me show you how to make me feel so good
let me show you how to take me to the edge of the stars and then back again
youve gotta show me how to drive you crazy
youve gotta show me all the things you want to happen to you
weve gotta tell each other everything we always wanted someone to do

i dont want to push you now and i dont want to rush
were getting closer every second now but close is not enough
the nightll be our cover and well huddle below
we got the music in our fingers and the radio

there really isnt any time to lose
were going to lose it if we wait until it gets too light
youre such a pretty boy
let me show you what to do and youll do it
but you gotta move faster
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
its all we ever wanted
and all well ever need
and its slipping through our fingers
faster than the speed of night

faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
its all we ever wanted
and all well ever need
and its slipping through our fingers
faster than the speed of night

faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of night
faster than the speed of nightembed"
