i had a dream last night
we drove out to see las vegas
we lost ourselves in the bright lights
i wish you could have seen us
begging for change to get home
or at least san francisco
lets put a ten on the high card
and spend a summer on the west coast

prechorus
down and to the left
heres a map and a pen the place you pointed at
be californias best
all i ask all i ask

chorus
hey please dont tell me that im dreaming
when all i ever wanted was to
dream another sunset with you
if i roll over when its over
ill take this cali sunrise with me
and wake up with the fondest memories

verse 2
we made love by the ocean
as the waves crashed around you
sunsets never were so bright
and the skies never so blue
you opened up into my arms
and we laughed as i held you
ill never go back to georgia
not at least til i have to
