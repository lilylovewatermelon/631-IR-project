take my eyes take them aside
take my face and desecrate
my arms and legs they get in the way
and take my hands theyll understand
take my heart pull it apart
and take my brain or what remains
and throw it all away

chorus
cause ive grown tired of this body
a cumbersome and heavy body

verse 2
take my lungs take them and run
take my tongue go have some fun
and take the ears take them and disappear
and take my joints take them for points
take my teeth tear through my cheeks
and take the nose go and dispose
oh would you go dispose just go dispose

chorus
cause ive grown tired of this body
a cumbersome and heavy body
ive grown tired of this body
fall apart without me body
ooh
see mother mother liveget tickets as low as 27you might also likebridge
take my eyes take them aside
take my face and desecrate
arms and legs get in the way
bodies break

chorus
ive grown tired of this body
cumbersome and heavy body
ive grown tired of this body
fall apart without me body
ive grown tired of this body
cumbersome and heavy
tired of this body
fall apart without me

outro
tired of this body
cumbersome and heavy
tired of this body
fall apart without me
tired of this body
tired of this body
tired of this body
cumbersome and heavy body
cumbersome and heavy body
