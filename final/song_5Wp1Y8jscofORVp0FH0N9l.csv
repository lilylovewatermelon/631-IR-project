daddy won a radio he tuned it to a country show
i was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
mama used to sing to me she taught me that sweet harmony
now she worries cause she never thought id ever really take it this far
singing in the bars

chorus
and chasing that neon rainbow living that honkytonk dream
cause all ive ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
just trying to be somebody just wanna be heard and seen
im chasing that neon rainbow living that honkytonk dream

verse 2
an atlas and a coffee cup five pickers in an old dodge truck
heading down to houston for a show on saturday night
this overhead is killing me half the time i sing for free
when the crowds into it lord it makes this thing im doing seem right
standing in the spotlight

chorus
and chasing that neon rainbow ima living that honkytonk dream
cause all ive ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
just trying to be somebody just wanna be heard and seen
im chasing that neon rainbow living that honkytonk dream

daddys got a radio he won it thirty years ago
he said son i just know were going to hear you singing on it someday
i made it up to music row but lordy dont the wheels turn slow
still i wouldnt trade a minute and i wouldnt have it any other way
just show me to the stage

chorus
im chasing that neon rainbow ima living that honkytonk dream
cause all ive ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
just trying to be somebody just wanna be heard and seen
im chasing that neon rainbow living that honkytonk dream
