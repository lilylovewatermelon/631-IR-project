ice in your veins blood in your brain
i feel your pain i think were goin insane
i saw you today and i thought i should say
that i still love you like i did back in 2008 okay
girl i got whatever you want right here
i aint never lettin you leave my dear
ima tie you up and ima lock you away
you dont ever listen to the shit that i say
ima make you listen to me
ima make you listen to me
smokin on some loud
