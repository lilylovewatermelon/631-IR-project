hey man its been a while
do you remember me
when i hit the streets i was 17
a little wild a little green
ive been up and down and in between
after all these years and miles of memories
im still chasing dreams
but i aint looking over my shoulder

chorus
i like the bed im sleeping in
its just like me its broken in
its not old  just older
like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
this skin im in its alright with me
its not old just older

verse 2
its good to see your face
you aint no worse for wear
breathing that california air
when we took on the world
we were young and brave
we got secrets that well take to the grave
and were standing here shoulder to shoulder

i like the bed im sleeping in
its just like me its broken in
its not old  just older
like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
this skin im in its alright with me
its not old just older

bridge
im not old enough to sing the blues
but i wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
you can roll the dice til they call your bluff
but you cant win until youre not afraid to lose

verse 3
well i look in the mirror
i dont hate what i see
theres a few more lines staring back at me
now the night has grown a little colder
hey man i gotta run
now you take care
if you see coach t tell him ive cut my hair
ive kept my faith
i still believe im just
ha
chorus
i like the bed im sleeping in
its just like me its broken in
its not old  just older
like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
this skin im in its alright with me
its not old justembed"
