old friend its been awhile
i aint spoke to you in years
and often times boys from this town
put wheels down and disappear
ms cole asked about you just three days back
and i had no answer to give her
i told her that you moved way out west
to write some songs and grow a little more bitter
the kids talk about you around here
like youre some kind of legend
i wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago
you were eager just like them

chorus
but if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of oklahoma city
therell be a porch light on from the post you leaned on
fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
and often times i pray for you and often times i dont
is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos
wont stay for long cause you wont stop your runnin
wait for tomorrow until tomorrows not comin

verse 2
heard you landed in tulsa while he slipped away
is that the reason youre fleein the fields we hauled hay
the heat this july or the dark last december
look in my eyes and you might remember
the weed out in norman or the stillwater strip
run far enough boy and youre bound to trip
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
but if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of oklahoma city
therell be a porch light on from the post you leaned on
fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
and often times i pray for you and often times i dont
is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos
never stay long cause you wont stop your runnin
wait for tomorrow until tomorrows not comin
send it

chorus
if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of oklahoma city
therell be a porch light on from the post you leaned on
fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
and often times i pray for you and often times i dont
is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos
never stay long cause you wont stop your runnin
wait for tomorrow until tomorrows not cominembed"
