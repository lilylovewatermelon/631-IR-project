verse 1 big sean
today is a good day
i wish a nigga would day
ride through the hood day
ride through the hood where i would stay
if i wasn’t me wasn’t committed
i told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last christmas
in the hood that you can visit
oh boy i got it no chasers
cause the best mixed with hennessey is problems
i took that advice young when i was headed up to college
momma swimming in that debt
rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
ready set go on your mark to the top
getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
i want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
you aint alive if you aint living that’s the motto
and imma’ probably wake up tomorrow sayin sayin

i’m bout to fuck the game then your ho next
i used to talk dirty on my cell no phone sex

all through my neighborhood next stop is the haters hood

i do this for real you lil niggas just fake it good

outro lawrence lamont
detroit once the backbone of this country
now it’s the largest us city to file for bankruptcy
thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
going from a population of nearly 2 million
to under 700000 in a matter of years
the people of detroit really going to have to stick together
to make it through these tough times5embed"
