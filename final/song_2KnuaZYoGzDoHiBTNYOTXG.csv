verse 1
love when it comes without a warning
cause waiting for it gets so boring
a lot can change in twenty seconds
a lot can happen in the dark
love when it makes you lose your bearings
some informations not for sharing
use different names at hotel checkins
its hard to stop it once it starts it starts

prechorus
im not sentimental
but theres somethin bout the way you look tonight mm
makes me wanna take a picture
make a movie with you that wed have to hide

chorus
you better lock your phone oh
and look at me whеn youre alone
wont take a lot to gеt you goin oh
im sorry if its torture though
i know i know
you might also likeverse 2
it might be more of an obsession
you really make a strong impression a strong impression
nobody saw me in the lobby saw me in the lobby
nobody saw me in your arms mm

prechorus
im not sentimental
but theres somethin bout the way you look tonight mm bout the way you look tonight
makes me wanna make em jealous
im the only one who does it how you like only one who does it how you—

chorus
you better lock your phone oh
and look at me when youre alone youre alone youre alone
wont take a lot to get you goin get me goin get me goin
im sorry if its torture though torture though
i know i know

and look at me a little more
we both know im worth waitin for waitin for
that heavy breathin on the floor on the floor
im yours im yours im yours
