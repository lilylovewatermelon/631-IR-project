lets keep it simple babe
dont make it complicated
dont tell me to be glad when im sad
i really hate that
i try not to be bad
eccentricitys holding me back
if i could be more like you i would
but i cant and im glad about that

prechorus
what if someone had asked picasso not to be sad
never known who he was or the man hed become
there would be no blue period
let me run with the wolves let me do what i do
let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
i can turn blue into something

chorus
beautiful beautiful
beautiful like you
beautiful beautiful
beautiful like you

verse 2
lets keep it simple babe
we cant afford to change it
dont turn me into something im not
theres no way to sustain it
i try not to hold back
it seems either way it makes you mad
so ill be who ill be if you think that thats cool
then ill take you back
