pictures in my pocket are faded from the washer
i can barely just make out your face
food you saved for later in my refrigerator
its been too long since later never came

prechorus
i know one day eventually
yeah i know one day ill have to let it all go
but i keep it just in case
yeah i keep it just in case

chorus 1
in case you dont find what youre looking for
in case youre missing what you had before
in case you change your mind
ill be waiting here in case you just want to come home

verse 2
strong enough to leave you but weak enough to need you
cared enough to let you walk away
i took that dirty jacket from the trash right where you left it
cause i couldnt stand to see it go to waste

prechorus
i know one day eventually
yeah i know one day ill have to let it all go
but i keep it just in case
yeah i keep it just in case

bridge
in case youre looking in that mirror one day and miss my arms
how they wrapped around your waist
i say that you can love me again even if it isnt the case

chorus 2
oh you dont find what youre looking for
oh youre missing my love
you dont find what youre looking for
in case youre missing what you had before
in case you change your mind
ill be waiting here in case you just want to come home
in case yeah ooh10embed"
