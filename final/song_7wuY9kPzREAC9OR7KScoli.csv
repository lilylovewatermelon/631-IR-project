verse 1
you see that chick in the gym checking me out
any second im bout to stick her neck in my mouth
i lose a pill and im recklessly wreckin the house
that was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now
theres the necklace i lost right next to stephanies blouse
man i should check to see if my mom left any out
nope guess ill reroute
maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
oh jackpot yeah—open sesame mouth
down the hatch and the feeling—you cant match it
i raptattap on your door with a damn ratchet
attacktacktacking a whore with a damn hatchet
a knapsack packed with like fortysome xanaxes
shorty come back im tryna score me some lapdances
im bout to relapse so baby pour me some jack daniels
formula 44d and 40s with bad capsules
the bad apple spoils the bunch im back at ya

girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and are you menstruating baby
my little friends waiting to say hello
the way your titties are wigglin
and your bootys shakin like jello
girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello yeah

verse 2
my equilibriums off—must be the lithium
i dont need to buy any drugs man—people give me em
it just becomes everyday extracurriculum
no reason in particular—it was strictly fun
a fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
fiftyone people asleep in my damn living room
excuse me hun but what is your name vivian
i woke up next to you naked and uh did we um
of course we did but didnt i strap jimmy hun
im looking for the torn wrapper but there dont seem to be one
no offense baby girl i dont mean any harm
but disease is something im trying to keep my penis free from
i find the package and im cool—i immediately run
like speedy gonzales to see if i see anyone
who might have a couple of 3s—im fiending for some
my head is pounding to the beat of the drum
chorus 2
girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and do you happen to have anything on you
to make my mood mellow
some are oval and some are pink
some are blue and some are just yellow
girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello

verse 3
oh those were the days they certainly were
its hurting me to know that ill be closing that curtain for good
wordword chkwordword chkword chkchkword
i second that and i third rushed to emergency surgery
to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
hes no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these percodans
plus its getting to be where hell lustfully search the den
pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin him
tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of paxils
now hes doubling backwards and hes stumbling back
slipped and fell hit his back boom heard something go crack
now hes up in the bathroom like hes busting a nap
almost ended it that soon because of the fact
im just busting my own chops while im busting a rap
resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it im back
chorus 2
girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and do you happen to have anything on you
to make my mood mellow
some are oval and some are pink
some are blue and some are just yellow
girl i dont mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello

refrain
and so im saying hello hello
allow me to introduce myself myself
my name is shady
its so nice to meet you its so nice to meet you
its been a long time long time
im sorry ive been away so long so long
my name is shady
i never meant to leave you i never meant to leave you

outro

clean slate
