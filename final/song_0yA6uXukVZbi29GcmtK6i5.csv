so youre standing on a ledge
it looks like you might fall
so far down or maybe you were thinking about jumping
now you could have it all
if you learned a little patience
for though i cannot fly
im not content to crawl
so give me a little credit
have in me a little faith
i want to be with you forever
if tomorrows not too late

prechorus
but its always too late when you got nothing
so you say
and you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
before the sun rises today

chorus
if i am another waste of everything you dreamed of
i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you as you suffer
i will let you down

verse 2
so youre walking on the edge
and you wait your turn to fall
but youre so far gone
that you dont see the hands upheld to catch you
and you could find the fault
in the heart that youve been handed
for though you cannot fly
youre not content to crawl
you might also likeprechorus
and its always too late when you got nothing
so you say
but you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
before the sun rises

chorus
if i am another waste of everything you hoped for
i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you as you suffer
i will let you down

bridge
so youre standing on the ledge
it looks like you might fall

chorus
if i am another waste of everything you dreamed of
i will let you down i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you as you suffer
i will let you down if i am

verse 3
the answers we find
are never what we had in mind
so we make it up as we go along i wont let you down
you dont talk of dreams
i wont mention tomorrow
we wont make those promises that we cant keep
outro
i will never leave you
i will not let you down
i will never leave you
i will not let you downembed"
