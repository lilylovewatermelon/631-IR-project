all of this turbulence wasnt forecasted
apologies from the intercom
and i am relieved that id left my room tidy
theyll think of me kindly when they come for my things

chorus
theyll never know how id stared at the dark in that room
with no thoughts like a bloodsniffing shark
and while my dreams made music in the night
carefully i was going to live

verse 2
you wouldnt leave til we loved in the morning
youd learned from movies how love ought to be
and youd say you love me and look in my eyes
but i know through mine you were looking in yours

chorus
and did you know the liberty bell is a replica
silently housed in its original walls
and while its dreams played music in the night
quietly it was told to believe

bridge
i always wanted to die clean and pretty
but id be too busy on working days
so i am relieved that the turbulence wasnt forecasted
i couldnt have changed anyways
see mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeoutro
i am relieved that id left my room tidy
