look at this bigeyed fish swimmin in the sea
oh how it dreams to be a bird swoopin divin through the breeze
so one day caught a big old wave up on to the beach
now hes dead you see
beneath the sea is where a fish should be

chorus
but oh god
under the weight of life
things seem brighter on the other side

verse 2
you see this crazy man decided not to breathe
he turned red and blue purple colorful indeed
no matter how his friends begged and pleaded the man would not concede
and now hes dead you see
the silly man should know you got to breathe

chorus
but oh god
under the weight of life
things seem brighter on the other side
oh god
but under the weight of life
things seem so much better on the other side

no way
no way
no way out of here

verse 3
you see the little monkey sittin up in his monkey tree
one day decided to climb down and run off to the city
but look at him now lost and tired livin in the street
as good as dead you see
do what a monkey does stay up your tree

chorus
but oh god
under the weight of life
things seem brighter on the other side
oh god
under the weight of life
things seem so much better on the other side

outro
no way
no way
no way
no way out of hereembed"
