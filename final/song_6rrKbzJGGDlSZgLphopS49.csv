theres a moment
in your bones when
when the fire takes over
blood is running
heart is pumping
as the battle gets closer
ooh they can say what they want now
ooh cause well be screaming out

chorus
we can be heroes everywhere we go
we can have all that we ever want
swinging like ali knocking out bodies
standing on top like a champion
keep your silver give me that gold
youll remember when i say
we can be heroes everywhere we go
keeping us down is impossible
cause were unstoppable

oh whoa were unstoppable
oh whoa were unstoppable

every sound byte
everybody who gave up
