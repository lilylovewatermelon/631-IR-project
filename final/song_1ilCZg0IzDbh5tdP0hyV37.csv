make me believe that youre the same
speak tell me that youre okay
i keep biting on my tongue

looking at your face
as if we never made mistakes

breathe take in everything
become a person that i hate

im looking at your face
as if we never ever made mistakes

if i close my eyes long enough
would i die
or would i just get lost
you could find me if you care enough
but im hoping you dont

if i close my eyes for long enough
would i die
i cannot pretend i havent tried
i am hoping that you dont find meyou might also like2embed"
