love goes out out like a light
out like a flame and you cant find it anymore
just when you think its lost in the rain
it comes back knocking at your door

chorus
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
and around

verse 2
god put us here on this carnival ride
we close our eyes
never knowing where itll take us next
babies are born and at the same time someones taking their last breath

chorus
its the wheel its the wheel of the world
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around

verse 3
in the blink of an eye
it can change your life
and it never even slows down
its the wheel its the wheel of the world

i dont know what it is
im flying high
then im wondering why im sinking on this ship going down
life keeps on movin anyway

chorus
its the wheel of the world
its the wheel of the world turning around
its the wheel of the world
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
and around
and around keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning

bridge
it can open your heart
it can break you apart
and it never even slows down

outro
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
its the wheel its the wheel of the world turning around
keeps on turning
and around1embed"
