theres three balls and a strike
heres the pitch
its belted deep to center
revere goes back jumps at the wall and its gone

verse 1 drake
yeah isnt it amazing
how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
how beautiful our kids would be girl i dont need convincing
how every conversation starts with this time will be different
oh oh the idea is fun
oh the idea is fun
oh the idea is so fun every time
at least we try for home run every time
chorus drake
swanging eyes closed just swanging

same city same friends if youre looking
ill be here just swanging
dont talk to me like im famous
and dont assume cause i dont respect assumptions babe

ayy
she just wanna run around the city
and make memories that she can barely remember
and id allow her
talk about pussy power yeah
she just wanna run over my feelings
like she drinking and driving in a eighteenwheeler
and id allow her
talk about pussy power
she used to say you can be whoever you want even yourself
yeah i show up knowin exactly who i was
and never leave as myself
but when it falls apart im always still down
to pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
wish you would learn to love people and use things
and not the other way around

chorus drake
swanging eyes closed just swanging
same city same friends if youre looking for me

dont talk to me like im famous ayy
and dont assume cause i dont respect assumptions bae
im just tryna connect with somethin baby
ill be here just swanging ayy ayy
verse 3 drake
i remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
she call and tell me be here before the sun up
i be dressed before we hung up
i take eglinton to 401 east
and exit at markham road in the east end
where all the pretty girls are sleeping
my license been expired i renew it after the weekend
fuck i know i said that shit the last seven weekends
girl i guess procrastination is my weakness
i hate stoppin for gas this late
cause theres niggas creepin and not like how were creepin
summer is comin know you could feel it
twenty on pump whatever i aint got enough to fill it
wont knock on your door
my uncle say you drive my whip like its yours
i got the pedal to the floor
im on my motherfuckin way swangin
dont fall asleep on me hang in there
ill be there just swangin
ill be there just swangin
i treat you good girl like youre famous
i know im late its always the same shit
but dont fall asleep on me hang in there
im on the road right now swangin girl140embed"
