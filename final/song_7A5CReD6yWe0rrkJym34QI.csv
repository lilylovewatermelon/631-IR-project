rollin through the motions every day

i could lean in to hold you
or act like i dont even know you
seems like you could care less either way

what happened to that girl i used to know
i just want us back to the way we were before

chorus
do i turn you on at all when i kiss you baby
does the sight of me wantin you drive you crazy
do i have your love am i still enough
tell me dont i or tell me do i baby

would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
do i just need to give up and get on with my life
baby do i
