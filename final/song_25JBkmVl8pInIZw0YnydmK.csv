somehow calm
as she walks onstage
her entire empire
becomes your taste
your taste
show me

chorus
come
let me know what youre like
let me know what youre like
whats your taste

verse 2
i bet she carves your heart
when she walks onstage
her empire slowly
becomes your place
your place
show me

chorus
come on
let me know what youre like
let me
know what youre like
in your place
your place

somehow calm
as she walks offstage
an entire empire
recall your face
your face
show me

chorus
come
let me know what youre like
let me
know what youre like
your face4embed"
