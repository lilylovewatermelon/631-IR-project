brushfire fairytales
itsybitsy diamond wells
big fat hurricanes
yellowbellied given names
well shortcuts can slow you down
and in the end were bound
to rebound off of we

verse 2
well dust off your thinking caps
solar powered plastic plants
pretty pictures of things we ate
we are only what we hate
but in the long run we have found
silent films are full of sound
inaudibly free

chorus
slow down everyone
youre moving too fast
frames cant catch you when
youre moving like that

verse 3
inaudible melodies
serve narrational strategies
unobtrusive tones
help to notice nothing but the zone
of visual relevancy
framelines tell me what to see
chopping like an axe
or maybe eisenstein should just relax
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
slow down everyone
youre moving too fast
frames cant catch you when
youre moving like that

verse 4
well platos cave is full of freaks
demanding refunds for the things theyve seen
i wish they could believe
in all the things that never made the screen

chorus
and just slow down everyone
youre moving too fast
frames cant catch you when
youre moving like that
slow down everyone
youre moving too fast
frames cant catch you when
youre moving like that2embed"
