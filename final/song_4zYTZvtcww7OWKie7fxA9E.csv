verse 1
while he was schemin
i was beamin in the beamer just steamin
cant believe that i caught my man cheatin
so i found another way to make him pay for it all
so i went to neiman marcus on a shopping spreeah
and on my way i grabbed sole and mia
and as the cashbox rang i thought everything away

prechorus
oops there goes the dreams we used to say
oops there goes the time we spent away
oops there goes the love i had
but you cheated on me and thats for that now
oops there goes the house weve made a home
oops there goes youll never leave me alone
oops for all the lies you told
this is what youre owed

chorus
hey ladies when ya man wanna get buck wild
just go back and hit em up style
get your hands on his cash and
spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
oh when you go then everything goes
from the crib to the ride and the clothes
so you better let em know that
if he mess up you gotta hit em up

verse 2
while he was braggin
i was coming down the hill just draggin
all his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
sold everything else til there was just nothing left
and i paid all the bills about a month too late

the love we had just fade away away
