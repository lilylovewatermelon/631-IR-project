woke up alone in this hotel room
played with myself where were you
fell back to sleep i got drunk by noon
ive never felt less cool

chorus
we havent spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why wont you ever be the first one to break
even my phone misses your call by the way

verse 2
i saw your friend that you know from work
he said you feel just fine
i see you gave him my old tshirt
more of what was once mine

chorus
i see its written its all over his face
comfortable silence is so overrated
why wont you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call by the way

bridge
maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
maybe one day youll call me and tell me that youre sorry too
but you you never do
woke up the girl who looked just like you
i almost said your name
you might also likechorus
we havent spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why wont you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call
we havent spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why wont you ever say what you want to say
even my phone misses your call by the way110embed"
