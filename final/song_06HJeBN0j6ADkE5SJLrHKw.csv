i woke up to the 10 am oclock news
they all said that the sky was fallin
that god was callin on the chosen few
said theres fire where there aint water
said theres poison in the air
and i should be wishin for a little time to settle my scores
but i dont wanna be here no more

chorus
cause last night i drank that bar out of bottom shelf
came home told an angel to go to hell
made her cry let her pack her bags
and tell me shes never comin back again
outside its turnin its last turn
but right now thats the least of my concerns
cause man i had it made and i threw it all away
guess it aint a bad day for the world to end

verse 2
yeah i was gonna spend the rest of my days
kickin myself drinkin my weight in whiskey
just wishin the sun would quit shinin
talk about perfect timin

chorus
cause last night i drank that bar out of bottom shelf
came home told an angel to go to hell
made her cry let her pack her bags
and tell me shes never comin back again
outside its turnin its last turn
but right now thats the least of my concerns
cause man i had it made and i threw it all away
guess it aint a bad day for the world to end yeah
you might also likebridge
so let it end before my eyes
let the mountains fall let the water rise
cause its sinkin in that shes history
so it dont make a difference to me

chorus
cause last night i drank that bar out of bottom shelf
came home told an angel to go to hell
made her cry let her pack her bags
and tell me shes never comin back again
outside its turnin its last turn
but right now thats the least of my concerns
cause man i had it made and i threw it all away
guess it aint a bad day for the world to endembed"
