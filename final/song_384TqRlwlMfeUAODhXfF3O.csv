i can see it in your eyes see it in your face
banging on your chest acting tough looking unfazed
tripping over landlines cutting deep with a dull blade
running out of unrest going out of your mind

prechorus john gourley  zoe manville
lonely days will follow days will follow
and the gaze that stuck the halls will know your name

chorus john gourley  zoe manville
hit me like a tidal wave ooh
triggered by the aftershock
hit me like a tidal wave ooh
triggered by the aftershock
oohoohooh oohoohooh
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
hit me like a tidal wave ooh
triggered by the aftershock
aftershock the aftershock
triggered by the aftershock

verse 2 john gourley
i can see it with my own eyes the tracks down your face
it cant be easy tryna unwind sleeping on your daydreams
im not tryna roleplay these things can make us take the wheel
these days can break but im gonna take the wheel
