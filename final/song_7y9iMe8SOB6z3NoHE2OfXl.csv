got a boy back home in michigan
and he tastes like jack when im kissin him
so i told him that i never really liked his friends
now hes gone and hes callin me a bitch again
theres a guy that lives in the garden state
and he told me that wed make it til we graduate
so i told him that the music would be worth the wait
but he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

prechorus

but jealousy jealousy jealousy jealousy get the best of me

got a girl with california eyes
and i thought that she could really be the one this time
but i never got the chance to make her mine
because she fell in love with little thin white lines
london girl with a attitude
we never told no one but we look so cute
both got way better things to do
but i always think about her when im ridin through

and jealousy jealousy jealousy jealousy get the best in me

always make the same mistakes yeah
always make the same mistakes cause
