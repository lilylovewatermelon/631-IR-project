how have you been nice to see you again
how quickly these conversations
seem to end
you meet a friend every now and then
how quickly these relations turn
into trends

prechorus
put all your walls up
and open your windows
and close all your doors
you catch yourself standing
in front of the mirror
and now you need more

chorus
so what do you wish for
to catch you as youre falling
so easy to ignore but
now you hear it calling again

i wouldnt wanna be you
this lonely game that you play
between your walls you confuse
every heart that you break
so afraid that youll lose
always a void to replace
i wouldnt wanna play you
see trapt liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeverse 2
you try and pretend the truth is hard to bend
how easy these translations
can be read
what if you were led to play a different game instead
how hard these frustrations are
they are to mend

prechorus
put all your walls up
and open your windows
and close all your doors
you catch yourself standing
in front of the mirror
and now you need more

chorus
so what do you wish for
to catch you as youre falling
so easy to ignore but
now you hear it calling again

i wouldnt wanna be you
this lonely game that you play
between your walls you confuse
every heart that you break
so afraid that youll lose
always a void to replace
i wouldnt wanna play you
bridge
does it matter to you
does it matter to you
does it matter to you
does it matter to you

chorus
what do you wish for
to catch you as youre falling
so easy to ignore but
now you hear it calling again

i wouldnt wanna be you
this lonely game that you play
between your walls you confuse
every heart that you break
so afraid that youll lose
always a void to replace
i wouldnt wanna play you

outro
just wait
just wait
just waitembed"
