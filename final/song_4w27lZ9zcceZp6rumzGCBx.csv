verse 1 wale
only live once ima live mine up
fill up the cup lemme light my blunt
i dont really know what the fucks in my cup
but a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
im just here to have a good time
a little white chick a little white wine
out of town spent a couple nights at taos
smoking weed in the suite til we out of towels
and dont bother me high as shit from my broccoli
fly as shit for no goddamn reason
and yall aiite  but yall not like me
its mmg and thats my clique
thats boa see thats my set
cdg shit match my kicks
an apostrophe im behind that s
or the black bimmer back to pick me up
back wood the tree i’m ashing out
see i be kicking my raps good with or without sales
im killing these blackheads my rap is noxema
light it up for a nigga
one or two hoes aint enough for a nigga
one or two bottles aint enough for a nigga
red berry everywhere got puff getting jealous

verse 2 wale
one night love ima need that
he could own that shawty ima lease that
ima put you in the game where your cleats at
ima sign that work then release that
i dont be where the crabs or police at
i just be where the cash and the freaks at
smoking green bay nigga im a cheesehead
in a lambo see me where the gs at
10k in my camos
word 10 js and i cant move
shades lv was a little dough
im going hard for the days i was piss poor
and go hard cause i feel its only right to
maybach good music the right move
girls say everything that i write smooth
fuck rap im getting pussy off a haiku
one time for the girls with the right shoes
fuckin with a dude probably the right move
two times for the chicks with the right bag
if its right tonight i might bite that
3 times show me your peace sign
not with your hand girl
open your knees out
look money what we bout
stuntin when we out
double mg  out
