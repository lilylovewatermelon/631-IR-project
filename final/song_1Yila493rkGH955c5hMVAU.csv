but i couldnt count no matter how i try
they wouldnt fill the hole you left gaping
only drive it deeper farther down inside
i never blame you never blame you for leaving
you didnt have a choice nor did i
struggling with the fact the fact im no longer having
my rock to lean on a shoulder to cry

holidays couldnt get much longer
if only those memories could be more real
and i wish i could say you left me stronger
lying to myself wont change how i feel

trying like hell to more forward
empty bottles seem to lend a hand
staying up tll dawn drinking whiskey
cant drown my pain or make a better man

holidays couldnt get much longer
if only those memories could be more real
and i wish i could say you left me stronger
lying to myself wont change how i feel

i took after you since i can remember
look walk and talk nearly just the same
i dont think im ready for the burden
of carrying on our family name
i know for a fact how much you loved me
never missed a chance to tell me so
i can only hope soon enough ill realize
you raised me up to not fall but grow
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeholidays couldnt get much longer
if only those memories could be more real
and i wish i could say you left me stronger
lying to myself wont change how i feelembed"
