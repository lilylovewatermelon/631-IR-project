of three girls so sweet
they stormed through your turnstile
and climbed to the street
but after conception
your body laid cold
and withered through autumn
and you found yourself old

whats the reason why you have been so sad

he took a lover
on a faraway beach
while you arranged flowers
and chose color schemes

whats the reason why you have been so sad
whats the reason why you have been so sad

the girls were all there they traded their vows
the youngest on–µ glared with furrowed brows
they tenderly kissed and cut the cake
the bride then tripped and broke the vase
the one you thought would spend the years
so perfectly placed below the mirror
arriving late you cleaned the debris
and walked into the angry sea

and it felt just like falling in love again
