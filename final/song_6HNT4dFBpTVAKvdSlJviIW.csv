saw him in a book of fossils
dancing with some old apostles
i think if i went back in time
hed be there alive
root of all my jealousy
grounded in my devastation
i cant get no aviation
up in the sky his grandchildren fly
i dont sing i sigh

chorus
tell the archaeopteryx
that i never wanted this
featherhead metropolis
liar liar wings on fire

verse 2
when its fast approaching winter
and i eat my turkey dinner
tickles of hate they rattle my cage
and evolve to rage
this is when i make a choice
i will build a time contraption
i will start a chain reaction
know what i think im going to do
i am going to

tell the archaeopteryx
that i never wanted this
featherhead metropolis
liar liar wings on fire

bridge
now the clock ticks
and i hope this will fix
all the present bird tricks
farewell mr archaeopteryx

chorus
tell the archaeopteryx
that i never wanted this
featherhead metropolis
liar liar wings on fire2embed"
