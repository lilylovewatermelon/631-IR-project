lay back baby and well do this right
theres blankets in back we can use
ill start the car but well stay in park
the cold can kill us before fumes
nows the right time for a good song
got something to say what i cant
do you feel bad like i feel bad
well pour us a road well both drink and drive

chorus
kiss me with your cherry lipstick
never wash you off my face
hit me i can take your cheap shot
leave you with the love we made

verse 2
come alive on the drivers side
so close i taste your breath
your lips go dry but theres sweet inside
wine must go right to your head
itd be easy if you get mad
but three fingers point back to you
we could stay here
stay out all night
no one will know
us and the moonlight
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likechorus
kiss me with your cherry lipstick
never wash you off my face
hit me i can take your cheap shot
leave you with the love we made

bridge
i set my watch by a streetside clock
a needle in echo groove
you pierce my heart like a willing arm
your ticking makes my blood move
theres no way out this fade out
be happy to get what you do
make him notice with both fists
cause quitting alone will never get you dry
never get you dry

chorus
give me everything youve got now
i dont feel a single thing
drag me out into the cold rain
let it hover over me

kiss me with your cherry lipstick
never wash you off my face
hit me i can take your cheap shot
leave you with the love we made
hit me i can take your cheap shot
leave you with the love we made
hit me i can take your cheap shot
leave you with the love we made3embed"
