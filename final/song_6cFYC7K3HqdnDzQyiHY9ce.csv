if you got jack in your cup go raise it up
if you aint got enough go fill it up

chorus danny  charlie scene
im gonna chase this whiskey with patrón
i want a girl on my lap and a jägerbomb
im coming in hot you heard me
and imma make it rain on the girl who serves me
ill drink a fifth of vodka till its gone
and if it feels so good then it cant be wrong
im coming in hot you heard me
and we be taking shots and if not youre nerdy

verse 1 charlie scene
we only leave a preparty to go party some more
im already shitfaced before i walk in the door
this girls rubbing on my leg ive never met her before
and now shes making her way down to my gentlemans sword
it might be the drugs talking or the shots of patrón
but these bitches look like models and theyre ready to bone
ill take em back to my parents house well be home alone
ill slap them chicks and have em yelling like macaulay culkin
shes tearing it up yeah shes dancing her ass off
this girls like a mac the way shes riding my laptop
im tryna get my rocks off so dont try to cockblock
or ill grab my sawedoff and ill blow your cock off
you know we drink so much were getting drunk for weeks
we drink so much goose were turning into geese
me and my crew fly the v through vip
these bitches play my skin flute like theyre kenny g
