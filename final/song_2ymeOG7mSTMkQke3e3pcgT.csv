i was there in my trailer
down at the job site
the day that this stranger walked in
his face looked so sad and he carried a set of blueprints
and as i unrolled them the first thing i noticed
was there were no doors in the plans
he said if you build this for me
then when she comes back
shell never be able to leave me again

chorus
i said if i did
and she ever came back
friend tell me how would she get in
it would just be a prison that i locked you in
if you couldnt leave
youd never know if there was someone to love you
the way that she didnt before
theres two things that i know for sure
its that you cant make a woman feel something she dont
and you cant build a house with no doors

verse 2
owhile he was quiet i could tell he was thinking
i thought i just ruined his day
i just couldnt bear to see this mans last hope slip away
so i thought real fast and i started talking
said buddy we tried this before
and if there aint one shell make one
either way shell run
and leave you a house with a hole for a door

i said if i did
and she ever came back
friend tell me how would she get in
it would just be a prison that i locked you in
if you couldnt leave
youd never know if there was someone to love you
the way that she didnt before
theres two things that i know for sure
its that you cant make a woman feel something she dont
and you cant build a house with no doors

outro
no you cant make a woman feel something she dont
and you cant build a house with no doorsembed"
