just to say goodbye
ten different ways to enjoy this night
cant do this anymore
wont feel you anymore
how long ill wait
just to say goodbye
you could never let me in
holding on until the end

the time i waste just to say goodbye
out of your way
i could do this right
cant see you anymore
wont feel you anymore

how long ill stay
just to say goodbye say goodbye

leave it all the fights and all
summers getting colder
drive all night to hold you tight
back to california
days went by
we waited and i guess were getting older
we couldnt win in the end
you might also likeyoure gone
im miles away
turning out your lights
ten different ways i could end this night
cant do this anymore
wont feel you anymore

how long ill wait
just to say goodbye say goodbye

leave it all the fights and all
summers getting colder
drive all night to hold you tight
back to california
days went by
we waited and i guess were getting older
we couldnt win in the end

youre goneembed"
