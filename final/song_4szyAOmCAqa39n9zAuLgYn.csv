i fight the urge to search my name
theres a better me i swear
but curiosityâ€¦

chorus
i see
i let my ego get the best of me
in the age of excess less may be best for me

verse 2
god it makes me sad
were the last to know
the world is changin and upgradin
faster than we can control

bridge
sick of living in the old days
mind burdened by the old ways
keep trying to forget about it
watch a video dont fret about it no
you dont need it why you want it want it
i dont see you moving on kid on kid
i dont see you moving on kid
no i dont see you moving on

now i see
i let these people dig their hooks in me
and i consider myself a fool
plugged in half life
god youre a fool
you think these people really care for you
you really think they will be there for you
plugged in thats a half life

outro
i know you i love you
i want you i need you
you complete me you complete me i adore you i adore you
i adore you i adore you i adore you i adore you
i adore you i adore you1embed"
