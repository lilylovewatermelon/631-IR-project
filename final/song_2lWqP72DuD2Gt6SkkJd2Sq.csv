grown from a seed of hope ive never known
been raised by the surroundings of a home so cold so cold
if i only knew what i know

chorus
ill shake my fist up to the sky
just keeping my dreams alive
im one part saint and two part sinner
and the last part is still on the line

verse 2
we pray even when we know nobody cares ah ya
and make everything we know turn into fear
and then disappear
if i only knew what i know

chorus
ill shake my fist up to the sky
just keeping my dreams alive
im one part saint and two part sinner
and the last part is still on the line

chorus
ill shake my fist up to the sky
just keeping my dreams alive
im one part saint and two part sinner
and the last part is still on the line
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likebridge
eye for an eye they told me for some time
no way to hide from whats inside whats inside of me

chorus
ill shake my fist up to the sky
just keeping my dreams alive
im one part saint and two part sinner
and the last part is still on the line

chorus
ill shake my fist up to the sky
just keeping my dreams alive
im one part saint and two part sinner
and the last part is still on the line1embed"
