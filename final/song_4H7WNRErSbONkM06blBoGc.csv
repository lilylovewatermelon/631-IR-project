its true that all that you know is all that you are
you said that its all that you want and more
fuck off and pour another drink
and tell me what you think
you know that im too drunk to talk right now
you put your cigarette out on my face
so beautiful please woman

tell me that its all okay tell me that its all okay
ive been waitin on this all damn day waitin on this all damn day
call me in the mornin tell me how last night went
im here but dont count on me to—

verse 2
stay a little longer if you convince me
and tell me all the things that you have against me
every time we make up the truth is fadin
everybodys blind when the views amazin
damn who are we right now
can we have a little conversation
figure it out with no intoxication
we carry on what is our motivation
were never wrong how the hell we gonna make it
maybe were used to this
tell me what are we to do
its like we only play to lose
chasin pain with an excuse
