i got a funny feelin
the moment that your lips touched mine
somethin shot right through me
my heart skipped a beat in time
theres a different feel about you tonight
its got me thinkin lots of crazy things
i even think i saw a flash of light
it felt like electricity

chorus
you shouldnt kiss me like this unless you mean it like that
cause ill just close my eyes and i wont know where im at
well get lost on this dance floor spinnin around
and around and around and around
theyre all watchin us now they think were fallin in love
theyd never believe were just friends
when you kiss me like this i think you mean it like that
if you do baby kiss me again

bridge
everybody swears we make the perfect pair
but dancin is as far as it goes
girl youve never moved me quite
quite the way you moved me tonight
i just wanted you to know
i just wanted you to know
you might also likechorus
you shouldnt kiss me like this unless you mean it like that
cause ill just close my eyes and i wont know where im at
and well get lost on this dance floor spinnin around
and around and around and around
theyre all watchin us now they think were fallin in love
theyd never believe were just friends
when you kiss me like this i think you mean it like that
if you do baby kiss me again2embed"
