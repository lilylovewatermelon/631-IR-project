are you blind
blind to me trying to be kind
volunteering for your firing line
waiting for one precious sign
the flicker of a smile
you should try it just once in a while
baby its not quite your style
its simply too easy to do
and you might not see it through
see it through

chorus
ohoh so find yourself another place to fall
find yourself up against another brick wall
see yourself as a fallen angel
well i dont see no holes in the road but you
find another place to fall

verse 2
are you proud to have founded a brand new behaviour
with hatred and hurt as your saviour
but nobodys choosing to follow
so you choke back the tears and you swallow
men who have ruined your life
you consume them with minimum strife
now you have got indigestion
the antacid comes as a question

ohoh so find yourself another place to fall
find yourself up against another brick wall
see yourself as a fallen angel
well i dont see no holes in the road but you
find another place to fall

ohohoh ohohoh

bridge
there isnt much more i can say
i dont understand the delay
youre asking for friendly advice
but remaining in permanent crisis
affection is yours if you ask
first you must take off your mask
when your backs turned ive decided
youll throw it away just like i did

chorus
ohoh so find yourself another place to fall
find yourself up against another brick wall
see yourself as a fallen angel
well i dont see no holes in the road but you
find another place to fall
outro
ooh ohoh well i dont see no holes in the road but you
find another place to fall
ohohoh yeah well i dont see no holes in the road but you
find another place to fall
ooh ohoh well i dont see no holes in the road but youembed"
