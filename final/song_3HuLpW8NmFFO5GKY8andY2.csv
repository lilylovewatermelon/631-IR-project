that thrills and delights me
oh no
its just the nearness of you
it isnt your sweet conversation
that brings this sensation
oh no
its just the nearness of you

when youre in my arms and i feel you so close to me
all my wildest dreams came true
i need no soft lights to enchant me
if you would only grant me the right
to hold you ever so tight
and to feel in the night
