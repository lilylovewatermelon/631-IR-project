tell me once again
i could have been anyone anyone else
before you made the choice for me
my feet knew the path
we walked in the dark in the dark
i never gave a single thought to where it might lead
ooh ooh

verse 2
all those empty rooms
we could have been anywhere anywhere else
instead i made a bed with apathy
my heart knew the weight
ten years worth of dust and neglect
we made our peace with weariness and let it be
ooh ooh

chorus
the moon will sing a song for me
i loved you like the sun
bore the shadows that you made
with no light of my own

postchorus
i shine only with the light you gave me
i shine only with the light you gave me
see the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeverse 3
name your courage now
we could have had anything anything else
instead you hoarded all thats left of me
swallowing your doubt
like swords to the pit of my belly
i want to feel the fire that you kept from me
ooh ooh

chorus
the moon will sing a song for me
i loved you like the sun
bore the shadows that you made
with no light of my own

postchorus
i shine only with the light you gave me
i shine only with the light you gave me
i shine only with the light you gave me
i could have been anyone anyone
i shine only with the light you gave me
i could have been anyone anyone2embed"
