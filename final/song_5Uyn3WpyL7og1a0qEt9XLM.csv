the scenes greg is holding the phone up

richard now remember stevens that drill just isnt going to stop like a neurosurgical drill so as soon as you feel the release in pressure stop the drill or youll pierce his brain

izzie even if i dont see blood



mark and richard are in an xray room

mark trust your instincts stevens trust the feel of it

izzie im ready no wait i need to clean the drill off one more time

richard youve cleaned it a dozen times stevens its as clean as its gonna get you ready

izzie yes

richard ok place three fingers above the ear and two or three fingers in front of that on the side where the first pupil blew

izzie got it

richard all right now use the scalpel to make a vertical scalp incision down to the skull

friend jeez

izzie i see a lot of blood a lot

mark superficial bleeders nothing to worry about

richard are you at the skull

izzie yes

richard drill a hole in the middle of the incision

friend hands her a power drill

vince oh god

izzie ok that cant happen do you understand me sounds cant happen freaking out cant happen because if you freak out im gonna freak out and im the one holding a power drill to your friends brain so if youre gonna vomit if youre gonna make sounds step away if youre gonna stay here you have to pull it together ok

izzie ok im ready

mark the temporal bones only gonna be a couple millimeters thick

izzie ok im in but the dura looks fine

richard youre gonna have to go in again

izzie frontal lobe right

richard thats right just behind the hairline a few centimeters off the midline

mark this bone will be thicker about five times as think as the temporal bone

izzie ok got it second hole down

mark what do you see

izzie i think i seeblood i see blood

richard ok now this is important drill around the hole to expand the opening you have to try and relieve the pressure

izzie ok ok the hole is about 2 centimeters around now i see blood i definitely see blood

richard try to evacuate as much of the clot as you can

izzie with what i dont have suction

mark use your finger gauze anything

izzie i see clotted blood

richard no arterial

izzie no

richard good now how does the dura look is it bulging or does it look lax

mark and richard both look proud of izzie

izzie looks like its pulsating regularly with the heartbeat thats another good right

richard thats great stevens if its pulsating that means blood and oxygen are entering the brain now pack it with gauze so you can minimize the bleeding

izzie ok get the rescue rig in here

richard nicely done stevens

vince is that it is he gonna be ok

izzie weve relieved the pressure on his brain but hes still got a lot of other injuries

friend hey his eyes are open

they all have a moment of relief
