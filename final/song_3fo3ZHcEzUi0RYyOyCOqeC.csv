shawty we been sipping on bub
and i done had enough lets get up out this club
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone
shawty we been flirting all night
and once we outside can i offer you a ride
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone

verse 1
twinkle twinkle little star
over there standing by the bar
would you mind if i came to where you are
where you are
when i look in your eyes girl youre telling me yes
and when i look at the way your booty poke outta that dress
naw naw girl dont try to hide it
im on my way over there stand right beside it
i wanna know how you doing whats your name
girl this chemistry we share so insane
girl you know whats happening me and you just laughing
plus my phone done died so put your number on this napkin

chorus
shawty we been sipping on bub
and i done had enough lets get up out this club
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone
shawty we been flirting all night
and once we outside can i offer you a ride
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone

beautiful gorgeous
i aint tryna buy your time i cant afford it
what im tryna do is paint a pretty portrait
me and you a chariot ride with horses
i done came a long way from white tees and forces
and as a man i understand we cant force it
but if i walk you outside where the porche is
im tryna take you back home to my fortress
woman take my hand tell me whats your name
girl this chemistry we share is off the chain
tell me what you think you and i been laughing
baby girl im asking for a night of passion

chorus
shawty we been sipping on bub
and i done had enough lets get up out this club
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone
shawty we been flirting all night
and once we outside can i offer you a ride
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone
all that im thinking

bridge
all im thinking how can we get alone alone alone
just you and me baby alone alone alone just you and i
and once i get you ima kiss you ima touch you
cause youre soft as tissue when you leave me ima miss you
gotta get you alone alone alone alone
chorus
shawty we been sipping on bub
and i done had enough lets get up out this club
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone
shawty we been flirting all night
and once we outside can i offer you a ride
cause im tryna get you alone alone alone
you alone alone alone

outro

just you and i girl1embed"
