starin out at the rain with a heavy heart
its the end of the world in my mind
then your voice pulls me back like a wakeup call
ive been lookin for the answer somewhere
i couldnt see that it was right there
but now i know what i didnt know

chorus
because you live and breathe
because you make me believe in myself
when nobody else can help
because you live girl
my world has twice as many stars in the sky

verse 2
its alright i survived im alive again
cause of you made it through every storm
what is life whats the use if youre killin time
im so glad i found an angel
someone who was there when all my hopes fell
i wanna fly lookin in your eyes

chorus
because you live and breathe
because you make me believe in myself
when nobody else can help
because you live girl you live
my world my world has twice as many stars in the sky
because you live
i live

chorus
because you live and breathe
because you make me believe in myself
