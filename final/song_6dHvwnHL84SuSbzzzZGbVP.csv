back when i was just 18 i met the man in black
he said jon its nice to meet you my name is jack
we hung out all the time we became good friends
we ran around we hit the town every damn weekend
i started missin work cause i was dogtired
that boss man had enough and good ol jack got me fired

chorus
me and jack dont get along no more
hes high up on the shelf while im lyin on the floor
he makes me do things ive never done before
he makes me cuss he makes me fight
dont know what i did last night
shouldve left his ass at the liquor store
naw me and jack dont get along no more

verse 2
saw the girl of my dreams and man she made me nervous
so i leaned on my buddy jack cause he gave me the courage
i swept her off her feet stole her heart and made her mine
she moved in and didnt like my friend jack takin all our time
she started gettin jealous said jacks got to go
he just wouldnt leave so my girl hit the road and

chorus
me and jack dont get along no more
hes high up on the shelf while im lyin on the floor
