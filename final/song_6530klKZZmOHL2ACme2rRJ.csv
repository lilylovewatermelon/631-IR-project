verse 1
im in my lambo maggot my fo fo faggot
doors lift up im like go go gadget
see the shit i got on homie id hate too
my teflon on boy my government issue
ill hit your vertebrae bullets rip through tissues
your wife on the futon hugging that shih tzu
homie you a bitch you got feminine ways
heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
i got fo fifths and bananas on the ks
and got more whips than a runaway slave

i keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
i got the kind of money that the bank cant hold

stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
make the purple bring the green in fuck the law
