here we lay face to face once again
the silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
and im wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
were just holding onto could have beens that we should be letting go

chorus
it feels like youre a million miles away
as youre lying here with me tonight
and i cant even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the storys ending
we play the part but were just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though youre here
it feels like youre a million miles away
away hey yeah

verse 2
was it me or was it you that broke away
from what we were
cause like the seasons love is change
and every time i think about it
it tears me up inside
like the rivers of emotion
but i got no more tears to cry

it feels like youre a million miles away
as youre lying here with me tonight
and i cant even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
we both know that the storys ending
we play the part but were just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though youre here
it feels like youre a million miles away
away hey hey hey yeah

bridge
hey yeah yeah yeah
hey oohyeah
we can try to talk it over
but weve walked that road before
while our song is playing its last note
and we both know for sure
that its time to close that door

chorus
it feels like youre a million miles away
as youre lying here with me tonight
and i cant even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the storys ending
we play the part but were just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though youre here
feels like youre a million miles away
hey yeah
