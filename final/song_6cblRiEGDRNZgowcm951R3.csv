ooh ooh yeah

verse 1
niggas see the crib and ask who did i steal from
price tags on makin the world feel some
they dont have enough to satisfy a real one
maverick carter couldnt even get the deal done
niggas scared to come towards us gotta run from us
louisville hush money for my young gunners
rick pitino i take em to strip clubs and casinos
stack of cnotes get all you niggas scratched like preemo
worms i just opened up a can of those
my mother had a flower shop but i was sandras rose
two girls that i rope like indiana jones
i make them hoes walk together like im amber rose
yeah fuck that i got to up the ante
california girls sweeter than pieces of candy
had me all in nipsey hood to go link up with sammy
type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
head on a swivel i could shoot but i could never dribble
life too short i gotta get it fore they blow the whistle
my uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
but its gon take more than that for me to control my issues
i wasnt made for no casket or no prison cell
every title doin numbers like im miss adele
sandra knows i pulled us out of a living hell
im the chosen one flowers never pick themselves
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus

verse 2
niggas want a classic thats just ten of these
crime family like the genovese you dont want drama capisc
my house is full of supermodels just like mohamed hadid
i take this shit too serious you niggas my comic relief
i find it funny how i keep on talkin and commas increase
im standin at the top of where you niggas are climbin to reach
i even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
subtle reminders are key jeez
spoiler alert the second act is tragic
and everyone that wants the worst for mes askin what happened
backstabbed so many times i started walkin backwards
like charlamagne i see the light and see the darkest patches
bury me and ill be born again
i walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
i got some real demons across the border fence
and made a note of the mistakes we cant afford again
like i said can of worms and im the early bird
niggas want to hang but im too busy doin dirty work
hit em back and say well link up on the 33rd
when i say that they cursin me it aint dirty words
church of pentecost holy spirit synagogue
i dont know whos protectin me but we hit it off
sandras rose no wonder they tryna pick me off
i guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are
chorus
yeah no more no more
baby baby baby baby baby baby baby yeah
yeah no more no more
baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
