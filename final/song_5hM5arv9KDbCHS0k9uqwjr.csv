gone a little far
gone a little far this time with something
how was i to know
how was i to know this high came rushing

chorus
were on the borderline
dangerously fine and unforgiven
possibly a sign
im gonna have the strangest night on sunday

verse 2
here i go
quite a show for a loner in la​
i wonder how i managed to end up in this place
where i couldnt get away

chorus
were on the borderline ooh
caught between the tides of pain and rapture
then i saw the time
watched it speedin by like a train
like a train

refrain
will i be known and loved
is there one that i trust
starting to sober up
has it been long enough
will i be known and loved
little closer close enough
im a loser loosen up
setting free must be tough
will i be known and loved
is there one that i trust
starting to sober up
has it been long enough
will i be so in love
any closer close enough
shout out to what is done
rip here comes the sun
comes the sun

gone a little far
gone a little far this time with something
rudi said its fine
they used to do this all the time in college if you and i get comfortable

chorus
and were on the borderline ooh
caught between the tides of pain and rapture
then i saw the time
watched it speedin by like a train

refrain
will i be known and loved
is there one that i trust
starting to sober up
has it been long enough
will i be known and loved
little closer close enough
im a loser loosen up
setting free must be tough
will i be known and loved
is there one that i trust
starting to sober up
has it been long enough
will i be so in love
any closer close enough
shout out to what is done
rip here comes the sun
comes the sun15embed"
