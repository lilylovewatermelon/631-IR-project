for a second i was in control
i had it once i lost it though
and all along the fire below
would rise
and i wish you could have let me know
whats really going on below
ive lost you now you let me go
but one last time

chorus
tell me you love me
if you dont then lie
oh lie to me

verse 2
remember once upon a time
when i was yours and you were blind
the fire would sparkle in your eyes
and mine

chorus
so tell me you love me
if you dont then lie
oh lie to me
just tell me you love me
if you dont then lie
oh lie to me
if you dont then lie
oh lie to me
