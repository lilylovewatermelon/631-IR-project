rise above the crowds
and wade through toxic clouds
breach the outer sphere
the edge of all our fears
rest with you
we are counting on you
its up to you

outro
spread our codes to the stars
you must rescue us all
spread our codes to the stars
you must rescue us all
tell us tell us your final wish
now we know you can never return
tell us tell us your final wish
we will tell it to the worldyou might also like3embed"
