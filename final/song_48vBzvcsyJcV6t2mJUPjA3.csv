woke up this morning the house was cold
checked the furnace she wasnt burning
went out and hopped in my old ford
hit the engine but she aint turning
given each other some hard lessons lately
but we aint learning
same sad story thats a fact
one step up and two steps back

verse 2
bird on a wire outside my motel room
but he aint singing
girl in white outside a church in june
but the church bells they aint ringing
im sitting here in this bar tonight
and all im thinkin is
how the same old story same old act
one step up and two steps back

verse 3
its the same thing night all night
whos wrong and baby whos right
another fight and i slam the door on
another battle in our dirty little war
when i look at myself i dont see
the man i wanted to be
somewhere along the line i slipped off track
living one step up and two steps back
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 4
theres a girl across the bar i
get the message shes sending
mm she aint looking too married
me well honey i pretended
last night i dreamed i held you in my arms
the music was never ending
we danced as the evening sky faded to black
moving one step up and two steps up
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
oh baby were moving

refrain
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
mm one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back
one step up and two steps back

outro
ooh were moving
one step up and two steps back
oh babyembed"
