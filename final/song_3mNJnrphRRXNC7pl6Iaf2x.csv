walk away from the sun come slowly undone
i can see in your eyes ive already won
i could bleed for a smile i could cry for some fun
walk away from the sun and tell everyone

verse
theres so much left in the air
so much to tell from a stare
theres so much left to defend
but i am no fun

chorus
so turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
i can tell by your smile youre coming undone
i could bleed for a smile could die for a gun
walk away from the sun and kill everyone

verse
so tiny dancer beware
were medicated and scared
this smile is so hard to wear
but i have no gun

chorus
so turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
i can tell by your smile youre coming undone
i could bleed for a smile could die for a gun
walk away from the sun and kill everyone
