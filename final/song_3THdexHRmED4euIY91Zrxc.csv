verse 1
its down to this
ive got to make this life make sense
can anyone tell what ive done
i miss the life
i miss the colors of the world
can anyone tell where i am

chorus
cause now again ive found myself so far down
away from the sun that shines into the darkest place
im so far down away from the sun again
away from the sun again

verse 2
im over this
im tired of living in the dark
can anyone see me down here
the feelings gone
theres nothing left to lift me up
back into the world i know

chorus
cause now again ive found myself so far down
away from the sun that shines into the darkest place
im so far down away from the sun again
away from the sun
that shines to light the way for me
to find my way back into the arms
that care about the ones like me
im so far down away from the sun again
oh no
