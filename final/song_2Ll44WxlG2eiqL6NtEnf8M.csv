watch your back because the next man is coming
and you dont know if the next man is dumbin
survival of the fittest what it is
i got your back you got my back and thats the biz
blood is rushing through my veins i got the power
channel the energy and with my strength i will devour
sickening thoughts is running through my head
thats when i realize im glad im not dead

prechorus
corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the publics craving
existence in the dark

its in our nature to kill ourselves
its in our nature to kill each other
its in our nature to kill kill kill

verse 2
it was a dream and then it hit me reality struck
and now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
close to a buck fifty we all stand strong
in respect to the family in times of insanity
and through words of profanity
i describe our dysfunctional family
blood brothers keep it real to the end
