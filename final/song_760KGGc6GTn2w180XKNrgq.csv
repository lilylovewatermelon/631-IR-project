where ive been losin sleep
it seems to me since youve been gone
the dark got twice as deep

my mind tries to forget you
but my heart comes back for more
cause you put the hurt on me
like i never felt before

dont need a guilty conscience
to follow me around
dont need no one to tell me why
the rain keeps pourin down

dont need another dark cloud
hangin round outside my door
cause you put the hurt on me
like i never felt before

the flames have turned to ashes
but theres still some embers left
missin you is harder than
this whiskey on my breath

i never had a memory cut
a path as wide as yours
cause you put the hurt on me
like i never felt before
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likethe flames have turned to ashes

like i never felt before
