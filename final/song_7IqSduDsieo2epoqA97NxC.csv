verse 1
ive never been so caught up
still so into us
i never thought id be here
shouldve turned to dust
ooh lets be honest baby
this is so unusual
ooh im not tempted baby
even if theyre beautiful

prechorus
i used to be cautious
a little too reckless
now all my emotions
are all cause of you

chorus
i aint even think of leaving sometimes
i aint even think of letting go
i aint ever thought of going nowhere
i dont even see it down the road
cause were collectin moments
tattoos on my mind
i aint even think of leaving sometimes
i aint even think of letting go
not even sometimes

i dont know i dont know i dont know
why it never worked but its going to now

hard to breathe when youre kissing me there
hard to breathe when youre not here
