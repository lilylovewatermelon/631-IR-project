sometimes i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
i know i can count on you
sometimes i feel like saying lord i just dont care
but youve got the love i need to see me through

verse 2
sometimes it seems the going is just too rough
and things go wrong no matter what i do
now and then it seems that life is just too much
but youve got the love i need to see me through
when food is gone you are my daily need oh
when friends are gone i know my saviors love is real
you know its real

chorus
cause youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love
youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love

verse 3
time after time i think oh lord whats the use
time after time i think its just no good
cause sooner or later in life the things you love you lose
but youve got the love i need to see me through

chorus
youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love
youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love
youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love
youve got the love youve got the love and youve got the love
