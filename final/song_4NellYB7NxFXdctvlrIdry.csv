hoes peep when i creep up the block
dopefiends beep me when they need some rocks
add 20 subtract the top
im pimpin hard in the parkin lot
screens fall when i lean in the truck
candy paint fo screens on buck
no game needed to pull a slut
i just open mouth and show princess cuts
i pack a 9 at all times
i shine a lot cause i grind for mine
why hate on me  you far behind
wastin time by talkin down
you considered trash and im in my prime
