you say you feel so down
every time i turn around
and you say you shouldve been gone by now
and you you think that everythings wrong
you ask me how to carry on
well make it through another day just hold on

chorus
cause life starts now
youve done all the things
that could kill you somehow
and youre so far down
but you will survive this somehow
because life starts now

verse 2
i hate to see you fall down
ill pick you up off the ground
ive watched the weight of your world come down
and now its your your chance to move on
change the way youve lived for so long
and find the strength youve had inside all along

chorus
cause life starts now
youve done all the things
that could kill you somehow
and youre so far down
but you will survive this somehow
because life starts now
you might also likebridge
all this pain
take this life and make it yours
all this hate
take your heart and let it love again
you will survive this somehow

chorus
life starts now
youve done all the things
that could kill you somehow
and youre so far down
life starts now
youve done all the things
that could kill you somehow
and youre so far down
life starts now2embed"
