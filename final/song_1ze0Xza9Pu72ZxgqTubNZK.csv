whats happened to you
its obvious youve changed
something deep inside you
is probably to blame
must be lonely up there
with your head all in the clouds
even though you got there
what does your conscience tell you now

chorus
its never the same on the way down
how does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground
when all of your bridges arent around
and the sandcastles you built are falling down

verse 2
you had us all
sitting right there in your hands
but you had to fall
because thats how this life is
got your fingers burned
by burning candles at both ends
now the tables turned
and now your demons are your friends

its never the same on the way down
how does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground
when all of your bridges arent around
and the sandcastles you built are falling down

bridge
so now i question what youre gonna do
now that everythings caught up with you
you believe the shit you say is true
but everybodys on to you
life remembers everything you do
your karma has caught up with you

chorus
its never the same on the way down
how does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground
when all of your bridges arent around
and the sandcastles you built are falling down

outro
