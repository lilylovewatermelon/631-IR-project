im trying to hold my breath
let it stay this way
cant let this moment end
you set off a dream in me
getting louder now
can you hear it echoing

prechorus
take my hand
will you share this with me
cause darling without you

chorus
all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the night sky
will never be enough
never be enough
towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world but itll
never be enough
never be enough for me
