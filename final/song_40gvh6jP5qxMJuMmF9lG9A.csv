verse 1
she was fivefoot four with some money on the floor
and a box thats hidden under her bed

verse 2
she was fivefoot four getting money on tour
but her socks were at the end of my bed
got our names tattooed on each other
just to prove to each other that wed do what we said

when she first made me feel like a man ohoh oohooh

part ii valentines

spoken word
to those of you in which i choose to always be the closest to
theres something that you need to know
loving me is not a joke
and you can put it all on me you can laugh and you can bleed
and ill adopt it all because thats just what a buddy does
i loved you from minute one the iced tea to my lemonade
never one to hit and run soaking every minute made
you can give me all your juice i can squeeze it out for you
and all i ask you in exchange love me back through every phase
if it ever comes off wrong or leaves you with a bitter taste
just remember youre the tea
and im your sour lemonade im your sour lemonade
tropical iced tea and hot pink lemonade21embed"
