cant keep my hands to myself
think ill dust em off put em back up on the shelf
in case my little baby girl is in need
am i coming out of left field

chorus
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
i been feeling it since 1966 now
might be over now but i feel it still
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
let me kick it like its 1986 now
might be over now but i feel it still

verse 2
got another mouth to feed
leave it with a babysitter mama call the gravedigger
gone with the fallen leaves
am i coming out of left field
chorus
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
i been feeling it since 1966 now
mightve had your fill but you feel it still
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
let me kick it like its 1986 now

we could fight a war for peace
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
give in to that easy living
goodbye to my hopes and dreams
start flipping for my enemies
or we could wait until the walls come down
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
its time to give a little to the kids in the middle
but oh until it falls wont bother me

bridge
is it coming
is it coming
is it coming
is it coming
is it coming
is it coming back

prechorus
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks yeah
your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
might be over now but i feel it still

chorus
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
ive been feeling it since 1966 now
might be over now but i feel it still
ooh woo im a rebel just for kicks now
let me kick it like its 1986 now
might be over now but i feel it still
