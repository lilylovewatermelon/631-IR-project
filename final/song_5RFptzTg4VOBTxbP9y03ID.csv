as a sinner or a saint as a hero or a villain
think about the steps you take
how do you want to be remembered
when theyre standing at your grave
on your tombstone what is written
think about the steps you take

all my life ive been searching for the answers
how did i lose so much of the things that really matter
is there no paradise cause i feel no joy or laughter
seems everything i touch only turns into disaster
so i ask myself

how do you want to be remembered
as a sinner or a saint as a hero or a villain
think about the steps you take
how do you want to be remembered
when your children come to aid
and they need some inspiration
think about the steps you take

do i reach for love do i reach for love only when she says shes leaving only when she says goodbye
do i pray above do i pray above only when i feel im needing
see i cant sleep at night when my sheep turn into demons
theres no alibi when the jury knows your secret
so i ask myself
you might also likehow do you want to be remembered
as a sinner or a saint as a hero or a villain
think about the steps you take
how do you want to be remembered
when your children come to aid
and they need some inspiration
think about the steps you take

cause on the day when you face judgement
you better have your story straight you better have your story straight
were you a good friend and a husband
to the wife that gives you love love love
you love love love oh

how do you want to be remembered
as a sinner or a saint as a hero or a villain
think about the steps you take
how do you want to be remembered
when theyre standing at your grave
on your tombstone what is written
think about the steps you take

how do you want to be remembered
how do you want to be remembered
think about the steps you take
how do you want to be remembered
how do you want to be rememberedembed"
