ooh ooh
hey hey

verse 1
so whats the price
were like mosquitoes to light in a sense
i feed off bioluminescence
love and intent
so its a quick fix
what else does life have to give but the pain
generated inside our own brains
its a sick game yeah

chorus arianna reid  daniel caesar
submit to me come get down on one knee
im your saviour and ill give you everything that you need
that you need
submit to me come get down on one knee
im your saviour and ill give you everything that you need

verse 2
blaspheming the spirit
i just dont want to hear it too deep
what ive sown ill continue to reap
ill earn my keep
it was all good intentions
did i forget to mention my god
just tryna get money with my dogs
is that so wrong

submit to me come get down on one knee
im your saviour and ill give you everything that you need
that you need
submit to me come get down on one knee
im your saviour and ill give you everything that you need

verse 3
lately youve been on a wave
seen you lit up in the place
sometimes youre sad i see it on your face
i can tell youre not okay
i know youre only seeking out the beauty
in fulfilling your duty
the answers it seems
are inside your own dreams

instrumental break

verse 4
good god jehovah whats this i see
my mortalitys staring back at me
niggas think im scared
niggas think im a bitch
like i aint come prepared and i aint know what this is
ive slept like jacob a rock for a pillow
run swift like elijah away from the middle
seen the world overindulged maybe a little
but now your boy is up and im fit as a fiddle
oh lord jehovah whats this i see
bourgeoisie tryna silence me
they dont know what ive been through
dont know what i preed
seen shit that you see up in your tv screen
follow me to salvation
your mind still pon plantations
the shepherd holds information
gives it out as its taken
