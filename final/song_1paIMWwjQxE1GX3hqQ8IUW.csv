verse 1 tyga
high in the video fuck with me hella raw
raw got a little riddle riddle twerk for a star
started from the like christina got a million
man im a good guy turned to a villian
bully in the pack turned to a rat
pussy on my jack i hit a bitch with a car bomb
bombs in la bombs in the bay
nigga you aint safe i run with niggas like odog
all we do is ball all we do is ball now im passed out
lean in the drop ice in the watch
nigga thats ben  jerry dollars watch a nigga make a stack house
gingerbread man run while you can
all you niggas lame tooly on me got killers on speed dial
infrared blam if a nigga shout
dont get packed out prolly hit a paparazzi when i back out

chorus tyga
can you see now are you senile
can you see now you could see now
can you see now can you see now
can you see now when you see a nigga dont be actin senile

verse 2 nicki minaj
sky dweller check helicopter pad
droppin off a body bag
money talk guess i got the gift of gab
dont interject dont intercept
you aint on a jet you aint meet a bitch with this kinda money yet
yeah i got an audemar i aint set the time once
and i know they say they shine i aint seen em shine once
all these rappers is my sons and im always nine months
man if this was baseball i aint let em slide once
do you see now you playin d now
oh you wanna beat me how
oh you the number one draft in the league now
ride down ya block doors 12 oclock
lambo the drop bike niggas aint stoppin for a cop
i got this shit locked tighter than a bear hug
when them bitches rap niggas need an earplug

can you see now are you senile
can you see now you could see now
can you see now can you see now
can you see now when you see a nigga dont be actin senile

bridge tyga
ride with the heat trunk full of beat
bomb like the middle east i got killers in the street
ride with the heat trunk full of beat
bomb like the middle east i got killers in the street
ride with the heat trunk full of beat
bomb like the middle east i got killers in the street
ride with the heat trunk full of beat
bomb like the middle east i got killers in the street

verse 3 lil wayne
nigga got a problem see about it
knock the nigga off beat the body
im just makin all these deposits
neighborhood nice and quiet thought i saw mr rogers nigga
i could sell salt and equalize it wait
i said i could sell salt and equalize it
boy i got every award but a heisman
do a driveby on you niggas make a uturn for survivors
take a newborn from his momma stick a shoe horn in vaginas
got the coupe on yokohamas got the super soaker chopper
well kidnap the kingpin like who is your supplier
nigga better know the fire nigga better know somebody
i know niggas thatll kill yah for a little notoriety
i can make a lion say meow
im in this mothafucka gettin money til im senile
tunechi
