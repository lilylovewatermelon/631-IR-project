it goes down down down when the plug is in town
my prescriptions fill em out pills get passed around
run run run run away from my pain now
i feel like passin out
why do i feel irrational
runnin out of pills now its time to ration out
until the plug come back around
until the plug come back around

interlude
sometimes it just be hard man
everybody got they demons everybody got they vices
everybody got they own opinion on what life is
that shitll have you feelin lifeless

verse
uh one two three four five six hunnid
i was just counting my sins
everywhere i go i see dark dont know where to begin
every morning on my knees praying to god that we win
fuck it lets win it then
i got rich bought my momma a crib
how much are you willing to spend
this money dont mean shit
but i still put them diamonds on my wrist to make niggas sea sick
but lately i been on my deep shit deep shit
on that life is a mountain and niggas dont know how steep it is
would give it all away just to stay sane
they be playin the same games
duckin and dodgin all my pain
still a gun on my waist hey
shoot a fuck nigga in the face okay
but its back inside my brain
nowadays shit isnt really the same
super serious this shit aint a game
i feel delirious beast in the cage
gettin furious but i aint fearin it
all my demons standin up in my face
used to pour lean in the minute maid
drank so dirty it need a maid
damn thats some dirty ass drank ayy
