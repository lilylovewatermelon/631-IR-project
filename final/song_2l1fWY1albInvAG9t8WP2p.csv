girl im glad you called first heard you talk
took me a second cause i couldnt hear your drawl
and that dont sound like you
no that dont sound like you
i know its been a while i dont mean to pry
but when i asked you if youre happy i didnt hear a smile
and that dont sound like you
nah that aint the girl i knew you always sounded like

chorus
truck tires on a gravel road
laughing at the world blasting my radio
cannonballs splashing in the water
doing whatever whenever you wanted
what did he do
because you dont sound like you any more

verse 2
your pretty brown hair you always loved it
guess he didnt like it so you just cut it
and that dont sound like you
nah that aint the girl i knew you always sounded like

chorus
truck tires on a gravel road
laughing at the world blasting my radio
cannonballs splashing in the water
doing whatever whenever you wanted
what did he do
cause baby you dont sound like you any more
oh anymore

you can leave them behind girl you know youre better than that
if you want to come back you can come back

chorus
truck tires on a gravel road
laughing at the world blasting my radio
cannonballs splashing in the water
doing whatever whenever you wanted
what did he do
because you dont sound like you any more

took me a second cause i couldnt hear your drawl1embed"
