whoever appeals to the law
against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward
whoever cannot take care of himself
without that law is both
for a wounded man
shall say to his assailant
if i live i will kill you if i die you are forgiven
such is the rule of honor

verse 1
broken the paradigm
an example must be set
invoke the sirens song
and sign the death warrant
this is what has been wrought
for thirty pieces of silver
the tongues of men and angels
bought by a beloved betrayer

chorus
i am the result
whats better left unspoken
violence begins to mend
what was broken
youve been talking
ive been all ears
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likeverse 2
words meant to dwell in darkness
shall never see the light of day
words can be broken so can bones
execute the mandate
mouth full of dirt
your name is removed from the registry
st peter greets with empty eyes
then turns and locks the gate

chorus
i am the result
whats better left unspoken
violence begins to mend
what was broken
youve been talking
ive been all ears
omertà

bridge
cheaply venal stupidly verbose
a slip of the tongue a slit of the throat
six feet under with no marker
keep my name from your mouth forever
free speech for the living dead men tell no tales
your laughing finger will never point again
outro
omertà
omertà
sing for me now7embed"
