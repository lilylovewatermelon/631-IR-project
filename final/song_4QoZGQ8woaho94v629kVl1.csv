we went out last night
like we swore we wouldnt do
drank too much beer last night
a lot more than we wanted to
there were girls from argentina and arkansas
maine alabama and panama
all mixed together and having a ball

chorus 1
yeah we went went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
hitting on everybody and their mother
there were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
singing i got you babe by sonny and cher
yeah life was good everywhere
we went out last night

verse 2
well you know im a music man
i grew up in east tennessee
last night i was everything
when i got a few drinks in me
i was a doctor a lawyer a senators son
brad pitts brother and a man on the run
anything i thought would get the job done
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus 2
yeah we went went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
hitting on everybody and their mother
there were people doing body shots up on the bar
jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
everybody was some kind of star
when we went out last night

bridge
well the fact that im still breathing
means that i must have survived
and that i lived to go out with my friends again tonight

chorus 3
oh we went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
everybody started loving on each other
they were dancing on the tables
and howling at the moon
pairing off together and pretty soon
there was not a sole in sight
when we went out last nightembed"
