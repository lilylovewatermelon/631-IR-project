thats real shit bro like
after you like a a baby a child a little kid

after you a child bruh aint no love in this shit man for real
this shit rough man
you got a long road boy a cold one

only love what you do for em
the only kinda love out here my nigga

verse
who can you trust in this cold cold world better get a blanket
its worse than the wild wild west this shit get dangerous
never thought id see the day separate glitter from gold
when friends turn into foes but its the life that i chose
and these hoes look so heavensent but be so devilish
got spiteful ways never seen it coming like a tidal wave
get on my knees every day i asked god and prayed
that my dirty ways dont lead me to an early grave
one life to live and its survival of the fuckin fittest
here come your rivals when you winnin they want competition
and did i mention niggas itchin to be opposition
hit they blocks with glocks with the extensions now aint no tension
told my old lady how im feelin she say im trippin
but she dont know i pray for love
on the block with the thugs
prayin a nigga show us love but aint no love so we get it out the mud
mama made me feel like i overstayed my welcome
so i packed up my shit and went for seldom like wheres the fellas
im pretty sure they understand the way i feel
hotbox the bucket laugh about how cold the world is
like aint no love in this shit til you get rich and famous
and these hoes want rappers or ball players
its hard to separate the fake cause they chose us
everybody showed up when we blowed up
