if youd like to walk a while we could waste the day
follow me into the trees i will lead the way
bring some change up to the bridge bring some alcohol
there well make a final wish just before the fall

chorus
promise i will be forever yours
promise not to say another word
nevermind whats done is done always was a lucky one

verse 2
watch the sunrise all alone sittin on the tracks
hear the train come roarin in never comin back
layin quiet in the grass everythin is still
river stones and broken bones scattered on the hill

chorus
promise i will be forever yours
promise not to say another word
nevermind whats done is done always was a lucky one

instrumental break

chorus
promise i will be forever yours
promise not to say another word
here forever deep beneath the dirt
nevermind whats done is done always was a lucky onesee foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also like1embed"
