something isnt right i feel it in my bones
every time i look around it follows me home
i think im paranoid

verse 1 brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
something isnt right i feel it in my bones
every time i look around it follows me home
and i get so stressed out with nobody here to listen
when my head gets loud from the weight of this vision

prechorus eric vanlerberghe  brian burkheiser
all this emptiness inside i cant fill the void in my mind
sometimes i just wanna die wish that i could tell you why
is it all inside my head i just cant escape the noise
is it all inside my head i think im paranoid
i think im paranoid
i think im paranoid

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
is it all in my head i cant escape the noise
is it all in my head i think im paranoid
take me to the edge like hands around my neck
hanging by a thread again i think im paranoid

verse 2 brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
something isnt right think they start to notice
hear it in the night in and out of focus
and i get so stressed out with nobody here to listen
got a head full of doubt from the weight of this vision

all this emptiness inside i cant fill the void in my mind
sometimes i just wanna die wish that i could tell you why
is it all inside my head i just cant escape the noise
is it all inside my head i think im paranoid
i think im paranoid
i think im paranoid

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
is it all in my head i cant escape the noise
is it all in my head i think im paranoid
take me to the edge like hands around my neck
