i got the blue marlin blues i got the blue marlin blues
i got the blue marlin blues i got the blue marlin blues
i got the blue marlin blues i got the blue marlin blues
i got the blue marlin blues i got the blue marlin blues

verse 1
first one off the dock long before dawn
headed to the blue water wont take long
a box full of ballyhoo rigged just right
still hurting from that party last night

verse 2
thirty miles later get the call lines in
scramble round the cockpit thinking were gonna win
seven hours later we still aint caught a thing
mood on this boat sure has changed

chorus
i got the blue marlin blues from my hat to my shoes
i used to catch em in twos no matter which bait id choose
how many more can i lose they got me drinking the booze
i got the blue marlin blues

verse 3
i had one swimming right behind my bait
all lit up man i just couldnt wait
i picked up the rod i put it in free spool
thinking ill shake these blue marlin blues
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 4
he knocked it out of the clip and i fed him some line
i locked it up and i began to wind
he came out of the water spit the bait right at me
and disappeared back into the sea

chorus
i got the blue marlin blues from my hat to my shoes
i used to catch em in twos no matter which bait id choose
how many more can i lose they got me drinking the booze
i got the blue marlin bluesembed"
