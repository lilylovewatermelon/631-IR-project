i cant believe i forgot your name

verse 2
its not about reciprocation its just all about me
a sycophantic prophetic socratic junkie wannabe
and theres so much skin to see
a simple epicurean philosophy
oh and you say you say im such a clich√©
i cant see the difference in it either way
and we left things to protect my mental health
but youll call me when youre bored and youre playing with yourself

what does it matter if i lie to you
i dont regret it but im glad that were through
so dont you tell me that you just dont get it
cause i know you do
