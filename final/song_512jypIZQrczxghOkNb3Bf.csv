when you feel so close to some resolve
and you write the words you were writing for
but your courage gets dissolved
into what i dont know

verse 2
when you feel that way again
you have to stop your thinking
and think of what youre here for
and let the rest of your feelings go

chorus
and youve got to find your balance youve got to realize
youve got to try to find whats right before your eyes oh
and if you find youve fallen and all your grace is gone
just scream for me and ill be what youre falling on

verse 3
when you feel so close to some resolve
and you say the things that youre standing for
dont let your courage get dissolved
cause its then that the fear grows

chorus
and youve got to find your balance youve got to realize
youve got to try to find whats right before your eyes oh
and if you find youve fallen and all your grace is gone
just scream for me and ill be what youre falling on oh oh

whoa just give me the word and ill be there
just tell me the words that ive been living for
just tell me the things that ive been fighting for
its do or die this is either or
just give me the word and i will be there
just give me the word and i will be there

chorus
youve got to find your balance you have to realize
youve got to try to find whats right before your eyes
and if you find youre falling and all your grace is gone
just scream for me and ill be what youre falling on oh

youve got to find your balance youve got to realize
youve got to try to find whats right before your eyes
and if you find youre falling and all your grace is gone
just scream for me and ill be what youre falling on oh ohembed"
