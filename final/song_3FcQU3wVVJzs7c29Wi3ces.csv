ooh oh yeah

verse 1 nicole scherzinger
i never needed you to be strong
i never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
i never needed pain i never needed strain
my love for you was strong enough you shouldve known
i never needed you for judgment
i never needed you to question what i spent
i never asked for help i take care of myself
i dont know why you think you got a hold on me

prechorus nicole scherzinger
and its a little late for conversations
there isnt anything for you to say
and my eyes hurt hands shiver
so look at me and listen to me because

chorus nicole scherzinger
i dont want to stay another minute
i dont want you to say a single word
hush hush hush hush
there is no other way i get the final say because
i dont want to do this any longer
i dont want you theres nothing left to say
hush hush hush hush
ive already spoken our love is broken
baby hush hush

i never needed your corrections
on everything from how i act to what i say
i never needed words i never needed hurt
i never needed you to be there every day
im sorry for the way i let go
on everything i wanted when you came along
but i aint never beatin broken not defeated
i know next to you is not where i belong

prechorus nicole scherzinger
and its a little late for explanations
there isnt anything that you can do
and my eyes hurt hands shiver
so you will listen when i say
baby

chorus nicole scherzinger
i dont want to stay another minute
i dont want you to say a single word
hush hush hush hush
there is no other way i get the final say because

i dont want you theres nothing left to say
hush hush hush hush
ive already spoken our love is broken
baby hush hush
