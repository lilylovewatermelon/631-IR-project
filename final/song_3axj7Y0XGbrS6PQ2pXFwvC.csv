3axj7Y0XGbrS6PQ2pXFwvC,A Song for You (feat. Chris Botti),"Michael Bubl√©, Chris Botti",2koUTBXkwUt2uJYv0uezHx,"9 contributorsa song for you lyricsive been so many places in my life and time
ive sung a lot of songs
i have made some bad rhymes
ive acted out my life in stages
with ten thousand people watching
but were alone now and im singing this song for you
i know your image of me is what i hope to be
ive treated you unkindly
but girl cant you see
theres no one more important to me
so darling cant you please see through me
cause were alone now
and im singing my song for you

you taught me precious secrets
the truth withholding nothing
you came out in front and i was hiding
but now im so much better
so if my words dont come together
listen to the melody
cause my love is in there hiding

i love you in a place where theres no space or time
i love you for my life
cause you are a friend of mine
oh oh
and when my life is over
remember when we were together
we were alone and i was singing my song for you
and when my life is over
remember when we were together
we were alone and i was
singing my song
for you
woah
for you
