our mission is to slay the sacred beast
who has come to claim our innocence at least
and though those who went before us wont return
for the feast

bridge joe hawley
worst of all it knows its only truth is made of lies
wanting for aught and everwise
so there will need to be a compromise
easier to close our eyes
see the other sides of our disguise

thought all our pain had finally been released
but as long as its alive well never rest
in one piece

meanwhile may it join in going
