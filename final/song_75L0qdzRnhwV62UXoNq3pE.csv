kush rolled glass full i prefer the better things
niggas with no money act like money isnt everything
im havin a good time they just trying to ruin it
shout out to the fact that im the youngest nigga doing it
cap on brim bent denzel every time
she aint tryna pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
iii tried to told you drizzy still aint nothin nice
bracelet saying you should quit cars saying fuck your life
okay now we outta here toodles to you bitches
and if you dolled up i got the voodoo for you bitches yeah
im busy gettin rich i dont want trouble
i made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
fame is like a drug that ive taken too much of
but i never ever trip just peace happiness and love
i got money in these jeans so they fit me kinda snug
plus the game is in my pocket nigga this is what i does ahh

im a bad bitch i aint never been a mixed breed

but i collect 100 thou at the venue
and pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me
