fell to my knees with a knife in my back
never thought youd be the kind to do something like that
but you did
cold hearted
you talked so sweet and your smell it made me weak
and i fell so fast that i never thought to ask
if you were
cold hearted

chorus
an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
i want someone to hurt you make you die the way i do
i dont think that i could be so
cold hearted

verse 2
pretty little words covered your dark and crooked heart
with a forked tongue i fell in love
then i fell apart
you are so
cold hearted
