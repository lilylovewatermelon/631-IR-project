you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought id live to see it break
its getting dark and its all too quiet
and i cant trust anything now
and its coming over you like its all a big mistake

prechorus
woah holding my breath
wont lose you again
somethings made your eyes go cold

chorus
come on come on dont leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
somethings gone terribly wrong
youre all i wanted
come on come on dont leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
cant breathe whenevеr youre gone
cant turn back now im haunted

verse 2

from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you

and he just might make me smile
but the whole time im wishing he was you instead

wont see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing

chorus
come on come on dont leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
somethings gone terribly wrong

chorus

cant breathe whenever youre gone
i cant go back im haunted
