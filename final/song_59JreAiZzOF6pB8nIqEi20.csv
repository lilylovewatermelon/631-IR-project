tonight i feel like im lost in the desert
but youre my oasis
you found my heart
tonight i feel like im lost in the desert
but youre my oasis yeah youre my oasis

verse 1
i am stuck in quicksand
and i am trying not to drown
fell in deeper this time and im struggling to get out
and doubt creeps into my soul
and now ive found theres nothing left to hold

chorus
tonight i feel like im lost in the desert
but youre my oasis yeah youre my oasis

verse 2
i thought id died
i had no fight i had given up
thought i was done i was savaged by the sun
i thought id died
i had no fight i had turned to dust
when i came to in your arms i knew i would make it through

tonight i feel like im lost in the desert
but youre my oasis
you found my heart
tonight i feel like im lost in the desert
but youre my oasis yeah youre my oasis
you found my heart
