im the next act waiting in the wings
im an animal trapped in your hot car
i am all the days that you choose to ignore

chorus
you are all i need
youre all i need
im in the middle of your picture
lying in the reeds

verse 2
i am a moth who just wants to share your light
im just an insect trying to get out of the night
i only stick with you because there are no others

chorus
you are all i need
youre all i need
im in the middle of your picture
lying in the reeds

outro
its all wrong its all wrong its all wrong
