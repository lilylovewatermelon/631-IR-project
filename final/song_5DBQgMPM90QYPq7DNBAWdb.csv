last night i was pourin out my heart
like a waterfall to you
and with one kiss i was a runaway train
flyin off the track to you
i love you came floodin out
couldnt make it stop couldnt shut my mouth
i felt like a fool when i lied and said i was sorry
but

chorus
i unapologize i meant every word
wont take back the way i feel about you
i cant unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i wont try to fight em back or hide my feelings for you
i unapologize

verse 2
you know people say a lot of things
that they dont really mean
and last night i told a little white lie
hoping youd forget the scene
where it felt like a movie under that porch light
couldnt help myself when you held me tight
said what i meant then i lied and said i was sorry
