i feel your racing heart
my liquid silver arms extended
these waves arent far apart
black gold in claw foot tubs unchanging

chorus 1
i am fire wheres my form
whisper crimson i intrude
theres light beneath your eyes
new overtones in view endless form endless time

verse 2
if what they say is true
you are a shadow in the fourth dimension
to float away with you
we see the corners where nothing happens

chorus 2
while we drifted we were one
ceilings lifted walls were gone
you speak the language of the breeze
all your leaves were meant for me
the love that every person wants to be

outro
stuck together i dont like revealing secrets
ill live inside your lips if you wont laugh
my heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
fallow fingers theres a surface i can count on
shed fit inside my heart and take it over
til her cape got blown into my red lungs
either theres a purpose
or im heading out at breakfast
take a drink take a drag
one more coffee ugly hat
no more mirrors woolen bag and i am goneyou might also like3embed"
