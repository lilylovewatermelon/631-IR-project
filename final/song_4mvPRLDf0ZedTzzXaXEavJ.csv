dont call me out cause i heard you scream
i dont wanna get out of bed for this again
wont waste your time i heard it in a dream
i dont believe you trust in me
trust in me

verse 1
i bet you only listen to your friends
im talking like i can pretend
that i feel better when
you tell me that i always have to go
you tell me what i want to know
and i feel better for it

verse 2
but i know sometimes its hard for me to say
i love you every other day
you pour my heart away

verse 3
and sometimes im scared of what theyve done
so i look how far weve come
you think you dont have to put up a fight but you might as well
so i tell you everything you wont admit
you tell me you dont care one bit
and i feel better for it

look online
do ten minutes of research and in turn find
the problem is poor kids who want holidays in term time
the problem is poor kids who cant afford the train fare
so we up the train fare and charge them for not paying the train fare
the problem is welfare
the problem is free healthcare
cause its unfair and if its gone its welfare
the problem is drugs
the problem is free love and free hugs
so stay in fear
do some drugs and stay here

well i say go on then
but god bless the weatherman
who has gone out of business since the psychoactive substance ban
the gateway has sent him back
from bulkbuying nos to selling crack
the problem rose when a rich man suggested it
over his lunchtime snack
so we ban the produce
and its a bit of a nuisance really

outro
dont waste your time i heard you scream
i dont wanna get out of bed today okay
wont waste your time i heard it in a dream
i dont believe you trust in me
trust in me
please trust in me
please trust in me15embed"
