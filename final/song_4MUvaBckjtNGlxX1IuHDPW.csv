imagine breathing in
imagine leaving all your air behind
what matters in the end
a matter of opinion til you find out

prechorus
life can only mean hardly anything
all ill ever be is partly settled in

they show you how to swim
then they throw you in the deep end
ive been learning since
but it doesnt mean ill float oh no
i wont float no no no no wont float

verse 2
i had a funny sleep
i didnt have a dream cause i dont believe in them

all ill ever be is partly settled in

chorus
they show you how to swim
then they throw you in the deep end
well ive been learning since
but it doesnt mean ill float oh no no no
i wont float no no no no no no
