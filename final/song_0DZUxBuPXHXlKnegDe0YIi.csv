im nothing special thats true
but i know what your thinkin
cuz im thinkin that same thing too
now youd like everything to go your way
and i should probably say everything youd like me to say
but thats not me and baby that just wouldnt be you
you better watch how long you wait
cuz baby you might wait too long

chorus
i dont know if i could make you happy
and i dont know if i could make you cry
i dont know if the clock stops at midnight
i cant see past forever but together we can fly
together we can fly

now lets pretend for a while that weve got no place to be
youve been broken before but baby that wasnt me
now im trying to ask you to come
to that same old place that youve been runnin from
weve been down that road
you know theres nothing to see
you better watch how long you wait
cuz baby you might wait too
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likerepeat chorus
bay there no use in waiting
i can see that your hopes are fading
they tell me that time is precious baby
why do you keep wastin time

repeat chorusembed"
