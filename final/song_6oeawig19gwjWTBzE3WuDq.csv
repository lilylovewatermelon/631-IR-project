youre still driving home at night while hes wiping off your blush
am i losing my mind
are you taking your time
to get over
to get over

call it intuition if you want
im still at the skatepark spilling all my precious blood
do you wanna know what i think
pretty much sums it up with the colour pink
cause im not over cause im not over

now the papers out
and everybody knows about your little lies
now the papers cut me up
and im the only guy that cant seem to get it right
and your lips are making their way around

comes
and it goes
a memory
thats over
come
around
id let you in but youre over
you might also likecall it intuition if you must
youre still driving home at night while hes wiping off your blush
am i losing my mind
are you taking your timeembed"
