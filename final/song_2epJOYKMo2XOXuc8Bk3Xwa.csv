beating the fall i cant help but desire of
falling down this time
deep in this hole of my making i cant escape
falling all this time

chorus
we come to this place falling through time
living a hollow life
always were taking waiting for signs
hollow lives

verse 2
fearing to fall and still the ground below me calls
falling down this time
ripping apart all these things i have tried to stop
falling all this time

chorus
we come to this place falling through time
living a hollow life
always were taking waiting for signs
hollow lives

postchorus
is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky
search in vain asking why
all alone where is god
looking down we donâ€™t know

we fall in space we cant look down
death may come peace i have found
what to say am i alive
am i asleep or have i died

we fall in space haunting me we cant look down haunting me
death may come peace i have found
i want to say my whole life something takes a part of me
am i asleep we fall down

chorus
we come to this place falling through time
living a hollow life
always were taking waiting for signs
hollow lives

postchorus
is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky
search in vain asking why
all alone where is god
looking down we dont know
