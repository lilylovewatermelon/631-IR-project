caught me off guard i wish that id been sober
still here we are back in hanover 99
just like old times all over
under the exit lights as beautiful as ever
i really wish that i dressed up a little better
no regrets is what we said
we cant go back again

chorus
darling nobody said that it would last forever
that doesnt mean we didnt try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesnt mean it was a lie remember
nobody said that it would last forever

verse 2
head in my hands cold coffee on the table
wish you the best i would if i was able
morning light it stings a little
out of my mind i dont remember calling
had too much tonic wine sometimes it does the talking
hope you know i wish you all the love youre looking for

chorus
darling nobody said that it would last forever
that doesnt mean we didnt try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesnt mean it was a lie remember
nobody said that it would last forever

chorus
nobody said that it would last forever
that doesnt mean we didnt try to get there
i never said that we would die together
that doesnt mean it was a lie theyll never
take those long summer days
when love was untamed
two burning hearts are dared to break remember
nobody said that it would last forever22embed"
