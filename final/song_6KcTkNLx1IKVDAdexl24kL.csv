i bet this time of night youre still up
i bet youre tired from a long hard week
i bet youre sittin in your chair by the window lookin out at the city
and i bet sometimes you wonder bout me

chorus
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i dont i almost do
i almost do

verse 2
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
cause each time you reach out theres no reply
i bet it never ever occurred to you
that i cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye

chorus
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i dont i almost do
i almost do
