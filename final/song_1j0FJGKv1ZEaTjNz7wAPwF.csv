now were broken on the floor
she just wants me to share her
it hasnt been this way before
she just wants me to dare her

chorus
the phone rings and she screams
stab my back its better
when i bleed for you
walk on me it never was enough to do
i cant get past her
falling faster
its true
it hasnt done a lot for you

verse 2
and every time he held you close
yeah were you thinking of me
when i needed you the most
well i hope that youre happy

chorus
the phone rings and she screams
stab my back its better
when i bleed for you
walk on me it never was enough to do
i cant get past her
falling faster
its true
its better when i bleed for you

i hope that love he gave you
was just enough to save you
you nearly broke my heart
just look at what youre tearing apart

chorus
stab my back
its better when i bleed for you
walk on me
it never was enough to do
i cant get past her
falling faster
its true
it hasnt done a lot for you

its better when i bleed for you
it never was enough to do
it hasnt done a lot for youembed"
