its always the same always ashamed
storytellin when i cant come in oh
to a hopeless troglodyte
but one more time my answer stands
i swear i mean no offense
but you better learn to read ah
its all about membership

verse 2
i spell it for the young and old
ugly girls and boys
i put you on my list and make you clap to this
is it mayhem or just an ego trip
but only one can win
and soon youll say thats him

no need to ask my name to figure out how cool i am
