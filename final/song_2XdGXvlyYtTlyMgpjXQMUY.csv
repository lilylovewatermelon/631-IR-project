is anybody there
let me know if you can hear me
it feels so cold and so alone
just need some sort of sun
and i know i know i know
were not alone
but its hard to tell
just let me know
so i can go
because i can feel a pulse
breathe please breathe
breathe for me
breathe for me
is it time to go
go and start the show
