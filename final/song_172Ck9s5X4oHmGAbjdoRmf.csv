verse 1
im on my grind grand hustle
got the mind and the muscle
50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
i still tote the glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
fuck probation if a nigga try to play me imma bust him
i dont need no security reaching for my jewelry
get you niggas popped quick filled full of hot shit
fresh out the box tip hopped in a drop 6
made a quarter mil in the pen givin stock tips
haters wanna stop tip mad cus they not tip
ball every summer so your baby mama jock tip
you dont no drama pimp i promise i do not slip
chrome 45th hid well if the cops trip
bought my girl a hummer with the chrome right in front of dat
5 carat stones with the platinum all up under dat
rap beef i aint gonna participate in none of dat
im aimin at your fitted cap and you aint gonna want none of dat

verse 2
i know a lot of rappers dont like me but they wont fight me
feds swear i sell dope well why they wont indict me
advances on the throne i aint never take it lightly
but all that tonguewrestlin hatin while im gone dont excite me nigga you aint scaring nobody
how many rappers you know that could hold they own on rice street
east steady talkin on the cell phone nightly
normal population half the jail just like me
polices think im crazy scared a nigga gon strike me
contrarily a nigga tryin me is unlikely
they barkin dont bother me ill be bombin fore they bite me
they just shocked to see my raps exactly how my life be
sheisty with a conversation quite pricey
my fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
might be thrown off my rocker just slightly
feisty flamin hot temper dont ignite me
im only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

chorus
asap asap asap

verse 3
flip say hello to the land of the people
my plan is to keep you at least 2 levels under me where i need you
imma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
your true colors done shown now its on when i see you
im grown nigga so let it be know we aint equal
you sadly mistaken if you thinkin i cant reach you
beat you to a fuckin pulp if i need to
the very spot ya standin in then is where ill leave you
seen on the scene white tees and evisu
og status i dont beef unless i need to
sissy you way outta line and you runnin outta time
hang behind closed dos when ya heard i got some time
yeah i know you were thinkin outa sight and outa mind
but im the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine
listen nigga this shit here is more than just a lotta rhymes
i dont know what ya do for your respect but ima die for mine

chorus
