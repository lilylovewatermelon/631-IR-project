hey hey hey hey
shes hearing voices call her
shes hearing voices warn her
she just cant sleep in her bed
she just cant sleep
shes falling down the stairs
shes tearing out her hair
shes screaming my name in the night
to keep her warm

chorus
she got a red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
milk of amnesia

verse 2

she got a red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
she got a red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
red pill blue pill
milk of amnesia

verse 3
shes scared of the blacks and shes scared of the jews
she is walking around she is yesterdays news
and she cries out my name in the dead of the night
she is sleeping in our room she is crying on her side
walking on eggshells im walking on glass
im burnt by the mirror im burnt by the light
feeling rejection ill burn down your house
tearing down posters i was never aliveembed"
