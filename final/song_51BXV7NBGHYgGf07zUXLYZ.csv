fuck you bitch im here all by myself
i tried the belt but couldnt get it tight enough
so i smoke the blunt my lungs are rust
my brain is dust from all of these drugs
i cant think straight ill walk the plank
spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me and eat me
—whole
in between hell and earth i do the limbo
my body alive but my mind is dead
going through the motions all of them emotions
dump me in the ocean im drowning again
we dont have to pretend

verse 2 lick loth
okay here we go blade to my throat
whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
bag full of dope room full of smoke
all black coat with a wolf for a cloak
do you feel my essence depressing presence
my main goal in death is to blow up heaven
dont get the message cant teach the lesson
just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants
ridin down crescent my weapon is ohsosharp and ready
ward of the 7th the legend is that you wont see twenty
me and lil uzi full of cruelty just a product of the times
