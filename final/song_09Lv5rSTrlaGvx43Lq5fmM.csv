ive been climbing my way through the sky
searching for answers that ill never find
losing my breath as i fall
learning to fly letting go of it all
learning to fly letting go of it all

ive been trying to open my eyes
take it all in as the world passes by
getting lost in the twists and the turn
finding these questions inside me still burn
finding these questions inside me still burn

chorus
im gonna live
like tomorrow never comes
theres no end in sight
tonight we black out the sun
better hold on tight
before you know its gone
and live like tomorrow never comes

verse 2
i keep looking for some kind of sign
trying to hold on in this race against time
i cant say where the next bend might be
that is the beauty in lifes mystery
that is the beauty in lifes mystery

im gonna live
like tomorrow never comes
theres no end in sight
tonight we black out the sun
better hold on tight
before you know its gone
and live like tomorrow never comes

theres no end in sight
for tonight we black out the sun1embed"
