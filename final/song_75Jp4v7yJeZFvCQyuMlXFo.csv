just walk away just walk away
theres too much wrong for you to stay
just walk away just walk away
gonna get yourself in trouble walk away

now he was just your average everyday traffic jam competitor
with half a gram walkin in the club tryin to set it off
she had two silicon weapons of mass distraction
nipples like screwin cleats damn near blastin
through her skin tight blouse she lookin for some action
said her hubby was out of town and started askin
if hed like to go to her house
i think thats when he realized he couldnt do it
looked at her finger a diamond from her ring
hit his eye he couldnt linger
he started feelin guilty for everything they were up to
he took a deep breath said you know what id love to
but evidently there is already someone who loves you
she looked at him like he insulted her and said fuck you
look at your pupils i know what that stuff do
mr goody twoshoes call me out ill call you out too
now he was weak as her he had a ring too

hook
just walk away just walk away
theres too much wrong for you to stay
just walk away just walk away
gonna get yourself in trouble walk away
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also liketogether in their deceitful ways embracing the lust
they got carried away like a dog chasin a bus
they were back at her house in another mans bed
and gettin freaky deaky while the husband sped home
to see his wife cause his job had got done early
meanwhile theyre wreckin the room
and talkin all dirty and sweaty
the hubby stopped and got some flowers so pretty
and a bottle of wine to spend some time with his sweetie
gets home sees a car in the yard and hes thinkin hmmm
walks up the driveway opens the door and goes numb
just about the time hes gonna yell honey im home
a trail of clothes down the hall leading to passionate moans
changed his tone tiptoed to the gun cabinet
grabbed a gun his daddy gave him that he used in vietnam
walk down the hall kicked in the door said surprise
sat down on the bed with guns and roses and wine

hook
just walk away just walk away
theres too much wrong for you to stay
just walk away just walk away
gonna get yourself in trouble walk away

hubby said how you two love birds doing you havin fun
dont cover up your nakedness now whats dones done
he made his wife call her parents
made the dude call his wife and daughter
and told them to come over lets talk about life
and then hubby called the preacher cause you want god involved
when the victim of infidelity has got a revolver
and the guests straggled into the room one at a time
realizing what was happening and then wishing they were blind
he told the preacher who had married them back in the day
that he was right the lord works in mysterious ways
then he addressed the room waving the gun carefree
saying ladies and gentlemen youve been called here to see
two naked embarrassed humans in a bed that i bought
they were havin great sex about the time they got caught
then he laid the gun down on the bed so relaxed
and said im leaving feel free to shoot me in the back
hook
just walk away just walk away
theres too much wrong for you to stay
just walk away just walk away
gonna get yourself in trouble walk away2embed"
