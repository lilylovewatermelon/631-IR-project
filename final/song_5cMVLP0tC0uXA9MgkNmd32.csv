remember when i cried
to you a thousand times
i told you everything
you know my feelings
it never crossed my mind
that there would be a time
for us to say goodbye
what a big surprise

prechorus
but im not lost
im not gone
i havent forgot

chorus
these feelings i cant shake no more
this feelings running out the door
i can feel it falling down
and im not coming back around
these feelings i cant take no more
this emptiness in the bottom drawer
its getting harder to pretend
and im not coming back around again
remember when
see avril lavigne liveget tickets as low as 31you might also likeverse 2
i remember when
it was together til the end
now im alone again
where do i begin
i cried a little bit
you died a little bit
please say theres no regrets
and say you wont forget

prechorus
but im not lost
and im not gone
i havent forgot

chorus
these feelings i cant shake no more
this feelings running out the door
i can feel it falling down
and im not coming back around
these feelings i cant take no more
this emptiness in the bottom drawer
its getting harder to pretend
and im not coming back around again
remember when
bridge
that was then now its the end
im not going back i cant pretend

chorus
these feelings i cant shake no more
this feelings running out the door
i can feel it falling down
and im not coming back around
these feelings i cant take no more
this emptiness in the bottom drawer
its getting harder to pretend
and im not coming back around again1embed"
