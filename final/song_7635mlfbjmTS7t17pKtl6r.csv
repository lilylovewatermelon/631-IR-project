verse 2 jayz
up in the clouds
me and my spouse
rumors on the ground gettin too loud
please turn them shits down down down
cant hear myself think
turbulence shit i almost spilled my drink
in the white house with a mink runnin through that bitch
like its my house all up in the hall like a mall
told you motherfuckers all i do is ball
no i dont member you i dont intend to
empty my memory bank
its a million dollars in it baby hilary swank
sittin next to hillary smellin like dank
presidential pardon name one nigga out there harder than him
ill wait
ive been in my wave like twenty years straight
ive been on my vibe like twenty years straight
dont fuck up my high fuck up my high
nights like this i could fuck up a pie
still be straight still be straight
fall back bitch i got a lot on my plate
dont waste my breath
i dont know how many moons a nigga got left
back to this joint
smokin this shit like im tryna prove a point
im the highest the highest title numero uno
kill my vibe thats your motherfuckin funeral
hahaha
verse 3 kendrick lamar
between you and me turn eulogy to urinals
niggas pissed off
i ministered this generation by far
leader of the new school
on my toes like a ballerina who knew id be black swan
world in my palms ironically
i am the globetrotters best cause i didnt drop the ball
told niggas when i was sixteen that id write a sixteen
to put a nigga right on the big screen
in the paddy wagon with six teens
shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin with morphine
i heal niggas touch down with more fiends
i kill niggas audio crack khakis to meal ticket
cardio lap was running for dear life
but now im running the map bitch im here nigga
picture lil ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
nigga you never be jay never be nas never be snoop nor dre
you aint get killed in vegas or in a suburban
nigga puff daddy wasnt your favorite
so many washed up with detergent
but i dont dry tears i just aim at them on purpose
like blah mini14 like blah
empty out another magazine like blah
let a young nigga get by doot
i kill em all when they try to kill my vibe doot doot
i am the bad the good god the last the hood got
the last that would try to pass a good job
if shawns a black beatle then i need a 10second drum solo
bitch see you at woodstock ah
