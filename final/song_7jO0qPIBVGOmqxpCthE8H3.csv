deadend streets and boulevards
you threw in the towel i broke your heart
but theres a first time for everything
who wouldve thought youd feel so cold
and all these memories seem so old
to think you were my everything

prechorus
remember when wed talk all night
but time aint easy on us how can love die

chorus
i got so much shit to say
but i cant help feeling like im camouflage
fortress around my heart
you were mine just yesterday
now i have no idea who you are
its like you camouflage

postchorus
but its good to see you here again
i dont wanna say goodbye
but its about half past ten
and i have to catch my ride
you might also likeverse 2
riding alone on the 405
and lifes so fragile its like i could cry
if thats the last time id see you again
but ill never tell you just how i felt
you might just not care and it might just not help
what if the feelings just dont make no sense to you you

prechorus
remember when wed talk all night
but time aint easy on us how can love die

chorus
i got so much shit to say
but i cant help feeling like im camouflage
fortress around my heart
you were mine just yesterday
now i have no idea who you are
its like you camouflage

postchorus
but its good to see you here again
i dont wanna say goodbye
but its about half past ten
and i have to catch my ride
chorus
i got so much shit to say
but i cant help feeling like im camouflage
fortress around my heart
you were mine just yesterday
now i have no idea who you are
its like you camouflage

but its good to see you here again
i dont wanna say goodbye
but its about half past ten
and i have to catch my ride17embed"
