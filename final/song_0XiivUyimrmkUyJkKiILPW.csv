the air my lungs first loved carves craters from my eyes
they said breathe deeply son or be the next to die
beneath the falling night and heavens shutting gate
pray keep your tongue held tight or suffer the same fate

chorus
the blood on our black gloves
it is none of your concern
if you want to call our bluff
get in line and wait your turn
and watch the witches burn

verse 2
dont flinch when innocents are dancing with the flame
if they wanted to live theyd learn to play the game
you can still walk away if you just hold your tongue
if youd just walk away youd live to see the sun

bridge
but under this killing moon
under this burning sky
the fires shining groom
i hold my breath and close my eyes

chorus
the blood on our black gloves
it is none of your concern
if you want to call our bluff
get in line and wait your turn
the blood on our black gloves
it is none of your concern
if you want to call our bluff
get in line and wait your turn
and watch the witches burn
outro
burn
well watch the witches burn
burn burn burn
well watch the witches burnsee thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also like2embed"
