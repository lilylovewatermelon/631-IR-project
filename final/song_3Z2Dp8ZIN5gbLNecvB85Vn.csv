i gave her money
i gave her time
i gave her everything
inside one heart could find
i gave her passion
my very soul
i gave her promises
and secrets so untold

prechorus
and she promised me forever
and a day we’d live as one
we made our vows
we’d live a life anew
and she promised me in secret
that shed love me for all time
it’s a promise so untrue
tell me what will i do

chorus
and it doesnt seem to matter
and it doesnt seem right
‘cause the will has brought no fortune
still i cry alone at night
dont you judge of my composure
‘cause im lying to myself
and the reason why she left me
did she find in someone else

it is a friend of mine
who is it
is it my brother
who is it
somebody hurt my soul now
who is it
i can’t take this stuff no more

verse 2
i am the damned
i am the dead
i am the agony inside
the dying head
this is injustice
woe unto thee
i pray this punishment
would have mercy on me

prechorus
and she promised me forever
that wed live our life as one
we made our vows
wed live a love so true
it seems that she has left me
for such reasons unexplained
i need to find the truth
but see what will i do
chorus
and it doesnt seem to matter
and it doesnt seem right
‘cause the will has brought no fortune
still i cry alone at night
dont you judge of my composure
‘cause im bothered everyday
and she didnt leave a letter
she just up and ran away

who is it
it is a friend of mine
who is it
is it my brother
who is it
somebody hurt my soul now
who is it
i cant take it cause im lonely
