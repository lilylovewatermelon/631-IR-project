alarum within enter duncan malcolm donalbain plennox with attendants meeting a bleeding sergeant

duncan what bloody man is that he can report
as seemeth by his plight of the revolt
the newest state 20malcolm this is the sergeant
who like a good and hardy soldier fought
gainst my captivity hail brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broil
as thou didst leave it 25sergeant doubtful it stood
as two spent swimmers that do cling together
and choke their art the merciless macdonwald—
worthy to be a rebel for to that
the multiplying villanies of nature 30
do swarm upon him—from the western isles
of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
showd like a rebels whore but alls too weak
for brave macbeth—well he deserves that name— 35
disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel
which smoked with bloody execution
like valours minion carved out his passage
till he faced the slave
which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him 40
till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps
and fixd his head upon our battlements
duncan o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
sergeant as whence the sun gins his reflection
shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break 45
so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark
no sooner justice had with valour armd
compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels
but the norweyan lord surveying vantage 50
with furbishd arms and new supplies of men
began a fresh assault
duncan dismayd not this
our captains macbeth and banquo
sergeant yes 55
as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
if i say sooth i must report they were
as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they
doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds 60
or memorise another golgotha
i cannot tell
but i am faint my gashes cry for help
duncan so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
they smack of honour both go get him surgeons 65
exit sergeant attended
who comes here

ross god save the king
duncan whence camest thou worthy thane
ross from fife great king
where the norweyan banners flout the sky 75
and fan our people cold norway himself
with terrible numbers
assisted by that most disloyal traitor
the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict
till that bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof 80
confronted him with selfcomparisons
point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
the victory fell on us
duncan great happiness 85ross that now
sweno the norways king craves composition
nor would we deign him burial of his men
till he disbursed at saint colmes inch
ten thousand dollars to our general use 90duncan no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive
our bosom interest go pronounce his present death
and with his former title greet macbeth
ross ill see it done
duncan what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won 95exeunt

drum within

third witch a drum a drum

posters of the sea and land
thus do go about about
thrice to thine and thrice to mine
and thrice again to make up nine 135
peace the charms wound up
enter macbeth and banquo

macbeth so foul and fair a day i have not seen
banquo how far ist calld to forres what are these
so witherd and so wild in their attire 140
that look not like the inhabitants o the earth
and yet are ont live you or are you aught
that man may question you seem to understand me
by each at once her chappy finger laying
upon her skinny lips you should be women 145
and yet your beards forbid me to interpret
that you are so
macbeth speak if you can what are you
first witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis
second witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor 150third witch all hail macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
banquo good sir why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair i the name of truth
are ye fantastical or that indeed
which outwardly ye show my noble partner 155
you greet with present grace and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope
that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
if you can look into the seeds of time
and say which grain will grow and which will not 160
speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
your favours nor your hate
first witch hail
second witch hail
third witch hail 165first witch lesser than macbeth and greater
second witch not so happy yet much happier
third witch thou shalt get kings though thou be none
so all hail macbeth and banquo
first witch banquo and macbeth all hail 170macbeth stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by sinels death i know i am thane of glamis
but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
a prosperous gentleman and to be king
stands not within the prospect of belief 175
no more than to be cawdor say from whence
you owe this strange intelligence or why
upon this blasted heath you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you
witches vanish

banquo the earth hath bubbles as the water has
and these are of them whither are they vanishd
macbeth into the air and what seemd corporal melted
as breath into the wind would they had stayd
banquo were such things here as we do speak about 185
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner
macbeth your children shall be kings
banquo you shall be king
macbeth and thane of cawdor too went it not so 190banquo to the selfsame tune and words whos here
enter ross and angus

ross the king hath happily received macbeth
the news of thy success and when he reads
thy personal venture in the rebels fight 195
his wonders and his praises do contend
which should be thine or his silenced with that
in viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day
he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks
nothing afeard of what thyself didst make 200
strange images of death as thick as hail
came post with post and every one did bear
thy praises in his kingdoms great defence
and pourd them down before him
angus we are sent 205
to give thee from our royal master thanks
only to herald thee into his sight
not pay thee
ross and for an earnest of a greater honour
he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor 210
in which addition hail most worthy thane
for it is thine
banquo what can the devil speak true
macbeth the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me
in borrowd robes 215angus who was the thane lives yet
but under heavy judgment bears that life
which he deserves to lose whether he was combined
with those of norway or did line the rebel
with hidden help and vantage or that with both 220
he labourd in his countrys wreck i know not
but treasons capital confessd and proved
have overthrown him
macbeth aside glamis and thane of cawdor
the greatest is behind 225
to ross and angus
thanks for your pains
to banquo
do you not hope your children shall be kings
when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me 230
promised no less to them
banquo that trusted home
might yet enkindle you unto the crown
besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
and oftentimes to win us to our harm 235
the instruments of darkness tell us truths
win us with honest trifles to betrays
in deepest consequence
cousins a word i pray you
macbeth aside two truths are told 240
as happy prologues to the swelling act
of the imperial theme—i thank you gentlemen
aside this supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
why hath it given me earnest of success 245
commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
if good why do i yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
against the use of nature present fears 250
are less than horrible imaginings
my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
shakes so my single state of man that function
is smotherd in surmise and nothing is
but what is not 255banquo look how our partners rapt
macbeth aside if chance will have me king why chance may crown me
without my stir
banquo new horrors come upon him
like our strange garments cleave not to their mould 260
but with the aid of use
macbeth aside come what come may
time and the hour runs through the roughest day
banquo worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
macbeth give me your favour my dull brain was wrought 265
with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains
are registerd where every day i turn
the leaf to read them let us toward the king
think upon what hath chanced and at more time
the interim having weighd it let us speak 270
our free hearts each to other
banquo very gladly
macbeth till then enough come friends

and you whose places are the nearest know
we will establish our estate upon
our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter 320
the prince of cumberland which honour must
not unaccompanied invest him only
but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
on all deservers from hence to inverness
and bind us further to you 325macbeth the rest is labour which is not used for you
ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
the hearing of my wife with your approach
so humbly take my leave
duncan my worthy cawdor 330macbeth aside the prince of cumberland that is a step
on which i must fall down or else oerleap

who should against his murderer shut the door

will plead like angels trumpettongued against
the deep damnation of his takingoff

striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsed 495
upon the sightless couriers of the air
shall blow the horrid deed in every eye

enter lady macbeth
how now what news
lady macbeth he has almost suppd why have you left the chamber
macbeth hath he askd for me 505lady macbeth know you not he has
macbeth we will proceed no further in this business
he hath honourd me of late and i have bought
golden opinions from all sorts of people
which would be worn now in their newest gloss 510
not cast aside so soon
lady macbeth was the hope drunk
wherein you dressd yourself hath it slept since
and wakes it now to look so green and pale
at what it did so freely from this time 515
such i account thy love art thou afeard
to be the same in thine own act and valour
as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that
which thou esteemst the ornament of life
and live a coward in thine own esteem 520
letting i dare not wait upon i would
like the poor cat i the adage
macbeth prithee peace
i dare do all that may become a man
who dares do more is none 525lady macbeth what beast wast then
that made you break this enterprise to me
when you durst do it then you were a man
and to be more than what you were you would
be so much more the man nor time nor place 530
did then adhere and yet you would make both
they have made themselves and that their fitness now
does unmake you i have given suck and know
how tender tis to love the babe that milks me
i would while it was smiling in my face 535
have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums
and dashd the brains out had i so sworn as you
have done to this
macbeth if we should fail
lady macbeth we fail 540
but screw your courage to the stickingplace
and well not fail when duncan is asleep—
whereto the rather shall his days hard journey
soundly invite him—his two chamberlains
will i with wine and wassail so convince 545
that memory the warder of the brain
shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
a limbeck only when in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death
what cannot you and i perform upon 550
the unguarded duncan what not put upon
his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell
macbeth bring forth menchildren only
for thy undaunted mettle should compose 555
nothing but males will it not be received
when we have markd with blood those sleepy two
of his own chamber and used their very daggers
that they have donet
lady macbeth who dares receive it other 560

macduff was it so late friend ere you went to bed

porter faith sir we were carousing till the

provoker of three things
macduff what three things does drink especially provoke
porter marry sir nosepainting sleep and
urine lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
it provokes the desire but it takes 790
away the performance therefore much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
it makes him and it mars him it sets
him on and it takes him off it persuades him
and disheartens him makes him stand to and 795
not stand to in conclusion equivocates him
in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
macduff i believe drink gave thee the lie last night
porter that it did sir i the very throat on
me but i requited him for his lie and i 800

and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp 955
ist nights predominance or the days shame
that darkness does the face of earth entomb
when living light should kiss it
old man tis unnatural
even like the deed thats done on tuesday last 960
a falcon towering in her pride of place
was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd
ross and duncans horses—a thing most strange and certain—
beauteous and swift the minions of their race
turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out 965
contending gainst obedience as they would make
war with mankind

macduff those that macbeth hath slain 975ross alas the day
what good could they pretend
macduff they were subornd
malcolm and donalbain the kings two sons
are stoln away and fled which puts upon them 980
suspicion of the deed
ross gainst nature still
thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
thine own lifes means then tis most like
the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth 985macduff he is already named and gone to scone
to be invested
ross where is duncans body
macduff carried to colmekill
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors 990
and guardian of their bones
ross will you to scone

hath in him closed whereby he does receive
particular addition from the bill 1115

against my nearst of life and though i could
with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
for certain friends that are both his and mine 1140
whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall
who i myself struck down and thence it is
that i to your assistance do make love
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons 1145second murderer we shall my lord

worlds suffer
ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
in the affliction of these terrible dreams 1190

a deed of dreadful note
lady macbeth whats to be done
macbeth be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck 1220
till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
and with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow 1225
makes wing to the rooky wood
good things of day begin to droop and drowse
while nights black agents to their preys do rouse
thou marvellst at my words but hold thee still

and the rightvaliant banquo walkd too late
whom you may say ift please you fleance killd
for fleance fled men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for malcolm and for donalbain 1500
to kill their gracious father damned fact
how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents tear
that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
was not that nobly done ay and wisely too 1505
for twould have angerd any heart alive
to hear the men denyt so that i say

lord the son of duncan
from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
lives in the english court and is received
of the most pious edward with such grace 1520
that the malevolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect thither macduff
is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
to wake northumberland and warlike siward
that by the help of these—with him above 1525
to ratify the work—we may again
give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
do faithful homage and receive free honours
all which we pine for now and this report 1530
hath so exasperate the king that he
prepares for some attempt of war
lennox sent he to macduff
lord he did and with an absolute sir not i
the cloudy messenger turns me his back 1535
and hums as who should say youll rue the time
that clogs me with this answer
lennox and that well might
advise him to a caution to hold what distance
his wisdom can provide some holy angel 1540
fly to the court of england and unfold
his message ere he come that a swift blessing
may soon return to this our suffering country
under a hand accursed
lord ill send my prayers with him 1545exeunt

his mansion and his titles in a place
from whence himself does fly he loves us not
he wants the natural touch for the poor wren

her young ones in her nest against the owl
all is the fear and nothing is the love
as little is the wisdom where the flight
so runs against all reason

enter malcolm and macduff

malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade and there
weep our sad bosoms empty
macduff let us rather
hold fast the mortal sword and like good men 1845
bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn
new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
strike heaven on the face that it resounds
as if it felt with scotland and yelld out
like syllable of dolour 1850malcolm what i believe ill wail
what know believe and what i can redress
as i shall find the time to friend i will
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues 1855
was once thought honest you have loved him well
he hath not touchd you yet i am young
but something
you may deserve of him through me and wisdom
to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb 1860
to appease an angry god
macduff i am not treacherous
malcolm but macbeth is
a good and virtuous nature may recoil
in an imperial charge but i shall crave 1865
your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
yet grace must still look so 1870macduff i have lost my hopes
malcolm perchance even there where i did find my doubts
why in that rawness left you wife and child
those precious motives those strong knots of love
without leavetaking i pray you 1875
let not my jealousies be your dishonours
but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
whatever i shall think
macduff bleed bleed poor country
great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure 1880
for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou
thy wrongs
the title is affeerd fare thee well lord
i would not be the villain that thou thinkst
for the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp 1885
and the rich east to boot
malcolm be not offended
i speak not as in absolute fear of you
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke
it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash 1890
is added to her wounds i think withal
there would be hands uplifted in my right
and here from gracious england have i offer
of goodly thousands but for all this
when i shall tread upon the tyrants head 1895
or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
shall have more vices than it had before
more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
by him that shall succeed
macduff what should he be 1900malcolm it is myself i mean in whom i know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
that when they shall be opend black macbeth
will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
esteem him as a lamb being compared 1905
with my confineless harms
macduff not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
in evils to top macbeth
malcolm i grant him bloody 1910
luxurious avaricious false deceitful
sudden malicious smacking of every sin
that has a name but theres no bottom none
in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
your matrons and your maids could not fill up 1915
the cistern of my lust and my desire
all continent impediments would oerbear
that did oppose my will better macbeth
than such an one to reign
macduff boundless intemperance 1920
in nature is a tyranny it hath been
the untimely emptying of the happy throne
and fall of many kings but fear not yet
to take upon you what is yours you may
convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty 1925
and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
we have willing dames enough there cannot be
that vulture in you to devour so many
as will to greatness dedicate themselves
finding it so inclined 1930malcolm with this there grows
in my most illcomposed affection such
a stanchless avarice that were i king
i should cut off the nobles for their lands
desire his jewels and this others house 1935
and my morehaving would be as a sauce
to make me hunger more that i should forge
quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
destroying them for wealth
macduff this avarice 1940
sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
than summerseeming lust and it hath been
the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
of your mere own all these are portable 1945
with other graces weighd
malcolm but i have none the kingbecoming graces
as justice verity temperance stableness
bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
devotion patience courage fortitude 1950
i have no relish of them but abound
in the division of each several crime
acting it many ways nay had i power i should
pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
uproar the universal peace confound 1955
all unity on earth
macduff o scotland scotland
malcolm if such a one be fit to govern speak
i am as i have spoken
macduff fit to govern 1960
no not to live o nation miserable
with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd
when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
since that the truest issue of thy throne
by his own interdiction stands accursed 1965
and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
oftener upon her knees than on her feet
died every day she lived fare thee well
these evils thou repeatst upon thyself 1970
have banishd me from scotland o my breast
thy hope ends here
malcolm macduff this noble passion
child of integrity hath from my soul
wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts 1975
to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth
by many of these trains hath sought to win me
into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
from overcredulous haste but god above
deal between thee and me for even now 1980
i put myself to thy direction and
unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
the taints and blames i laid upon myself
for strangers to my nature i am yet
unknown to woman never was forsworn 1985
scarcely have coveted what was mine own
at no time broke my faith would not betray
the devil to his fellow and delight
no less in truth than life my first false speaking
was this upon myself what i am truly 1990
is thine and my poor countrys to command
whither indeed before thy hereapproach
old siward with ten thousand warlike men
already at a point was setting forth
now well together and the chance of goodness 1995

pertains to you alone 2075macduff if it be mine

i say a moving grove
macbeth if thou speakst false
upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive 2400
till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth

i pull in resolution and begin
to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood 2405
