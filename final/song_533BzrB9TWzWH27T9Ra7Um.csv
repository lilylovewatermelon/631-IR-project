do we deserve a second chance
how did we fall into this circumstance
we werent so straight and narrow
this is much more than we deserve
a higher voice has called the tune
two hearts that lost the beat will now resume
the gift of life extension
by divine intervention

prechorus
ooh ooh ooh ooh

chorus
its gotta be a strange twist of fate
telling me that heaven can wait
telling me to get it right this time
life doesnt mean a thing
without the love you bring
love is what weve found
the second time around
