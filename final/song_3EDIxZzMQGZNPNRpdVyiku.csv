hold my shoulder
my garden puller
yes child you are a dreamer all the same
all your wonder
and all youre learnin
will turn it into somethin one day

chorus
yes now rise up like a fever
yes and give us a brandnew day
get up and be strong for youre already gone
and my darlin ill be with her once again

verse 2
many times ive been down
many times ive been low
many times pulled under by a weight i dont quite know
and in the times ive strayеd
and in my walkin away
oh i cant shake the need to come back homе

chorus
go now rise up like a fever fever
yes and give us a brandnew day
get up and be strong for youre already gone
and my darlin ill be with her
yes my darlin ill be with her
oh my darlin ill be with her once again
