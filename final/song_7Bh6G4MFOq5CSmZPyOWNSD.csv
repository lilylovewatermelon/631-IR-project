verse 1 ashanti
all alone and im feeling warm and
trying to wait but my bodys calling
youre the one so why dont you come and rescue me
ill be here while youre on your way
and counting down til i see your face
and hurry up cause i love the way you rescue me
now youre here come on out the rain and
soaking wet bodys glistening
finally we can do something so rescue me
cant believe how its going down
im so obsessed with this love i found
its got my head spinning round and round

i come alive when i feel your touch
and i could drown in this pool of love
now you could get what im thinking of

if you were gone i would find a way
to get you back cause i love the way you rescue me
laying here with you in the dark
i always knew you could shift my heart
when im with you i dont wanna stop so rescue me
only you can fulfill my needs
take me away from this agony
i wanna live out my fantasy just rescue me
