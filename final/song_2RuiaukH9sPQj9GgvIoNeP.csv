as i step to the edge on the shadow of a doubt
with my conscience beatin
like the pulse of a drum that hammers on and on
til i reach the break of day
when the sun beats down on the halfway house
has my conscience beatin
the sound in my ear the will to persevere
as i reach the break of day

chorus
when you lost all hope and excuses
and the cheapskates and the losers
nothings left to cling onto
gottta hold on hold on to yourself

verse 2
a cry of hope hope a plea for peace
and my conscience beatin
its not what i want for its all that i need
to reach the break of day
so i run to the edge on the shadow of a doubt
with my conscience bleedin
here lies the truth the lost treasures of my youth
as i hold to the break of day
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
when you lost all hope and excuses
and the cheapskates and the losers
nothings left to cling onto
gotta hold on hold on to yourself

chorus
when you lost all hope and excuses
and the cheapskates and the losers
nothings left to cling onto
gotta hold on
gotta hold on
