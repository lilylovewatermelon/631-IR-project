verse 1 ludacris  pastor troy
you wanna rush me you cant touch me trust me
cause you way too dusty and rusty and musty
you betta shop that make you pop up from lock up
but you tell your folks to hold your jack up to back up to back up
im ready so sit down or go ta your room
it aint nothin
ayy ayy watch out watch out boom
call me the hit man cause i make you wanna call timeout
then i make your mom cry out when i take your whole spine out
then watch me take ya and fake ya and shake ya and break ya
and see you on home to your maker
you should give up now for talkin shit like that
but then you nothing you garbage you betta watch ya back
