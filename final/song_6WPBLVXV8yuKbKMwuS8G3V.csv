verse 1
yeah its the way we are
we were smoking by eleven and knocking round town
beat em ups on my arm
we were never good at selling couldnt cut down
and i stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
hes got a heart made of stone but he never gets cold because the suns always on his back
i used to think you were cool and i believed you had a wonderful vision
but i soon found out youre a terrible friend and your mothers on the television
gives a go on your bike how you getting along with your life
its alright
yeah its alright

chorus
yeah so far its alright alright baby
yeah so far its alright alright baby
yeah so far its alright alright baby

verse 2
well im coming to the end of twenty three she said is that alright
well its coming to the end of you and me she said is that alright
and how can you complain about life and talk about being bored
if you just sit at petes house playing video games doing sniff that you cant afford
i cant be picking up in the town
so get me one off adam if hes sorting you out
i dont really care what all your friends were about
i was always looking for a way to get out
its just a reflection on the size of your house
a silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
but youre alright
yeah its alright

verse 3
so here we are its quarter to eleven were knocking round town
pushing in in the bar you can cry until 11 its a quarter of an hour
and why stay if you hate it so much
you think youre well cool
you just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
dont you want to take me up in the clouds
pretend that im the one and you can show me about
she was talking marriage so we had to get out
now hes making up for it by sleeping about
your ultimatums a ridiculous joke
im gonna pick the option that allows me to smoke
but im alright
yeah its alright
