i see you you see me
how pleasant this feeling
the moment you hold me
i missed you im sorry
ive given what i have
i showed you im growing
the ashes fall slowly
as your voice consoles me

chorus
as the hours pass
i will let you know
that i need to ask
before im alone
how it feels to rest
on your patient lips
to eternal bliss
im so glad to know
as the hours pass
i will let you know
that i need to ask
before im alone
how it feels to rest
on your patient lips
to eternal bliss
im so glad to know

in motion im feeling
my patience controlling
the question i wont speak
were telling the stories
our laughter he knows me
were leaving were talking
youre closer its calming

chorus

i will let you know
that i need to ask

that i need to ask
before im alone
how it feels to rest
on your patient lips
to eternal bliss

bridge
the night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
ive been waiting for this moment were finally alone
i turn to ask the question so anxious my thoughts
your lips were soft like winter in your passion i was lost

chorus
as the hours pass
i will let you know
that i need to ask
before im alone

on your patient lips
to eternal bliss
