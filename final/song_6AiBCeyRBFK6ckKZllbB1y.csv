sorry for party rocking

verse 1 redfoo
yo i be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
i got a drink in my hand and they just called buffalo buffalo
poppin bottles in the house with the models in the vip
all the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

chorus redfoo
lets go
people always say that my musics loud
sorry for party rocking
neighbors complain saying turn it down
sorry for party rocking
haters dont like we got the spotlight
sorry for party rocking
when they talk shit we just be like
sorry for party rocking

verse 2 skyblu
baby baby baby im awfully crazy
off ciroc off patron shit whatevers tasty
we dont got no manners hanging off the rafters
lets go drink for drink a hundred bucks she wont out last us
check my style take a good look im fresh bitch
in my whip with music so loud im deaf bitch
getting brain at a red light with people watching
sorry for party rocking

and if youre blacked out with your sack out this is what you say
sorry for party rocking

and if she has a hissy fit cause youre whiskey dick this is what you say
sorry for party rocking

verse 3 redfoo
i dont give a fuck when im in the club
sipping bub really drunk and i see a fat booty
