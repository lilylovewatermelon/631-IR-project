talk slow ive been listening all night
and your words they sound so right
well i i know that you came here with some guy
well tell him go home its you and i
yeah alright no

prechorus mitchel cave
cause ive been thinking bout taking the week off
so we can kick it and see where this takes us
and then you say we should just skip the basics
you put your hand on my mouth i dont say shh
ha and ooh this feels so right
and girl i know just why
its cause its you and i

chorus mitchel cave
we go where the heart is
and they dont know where we started
so just talk slow talk real slow
and just hold on for the time being
and when youre done come and find me
and then theyll know to talk slow
