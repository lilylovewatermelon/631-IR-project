when did i become so numb
when did i lose myself
all the words that leave my tongue
feel like they came from someone else

chorus
im paralyzed where are my feelings
i no longer feel things i know i should
im paralyzed where is the real me
im lost and it kills me inside im paralyzed

verse 2
when did i become so cold
when did i become ashamed oh
wheres the person that i know
they must have left they must have left with all of my faith

chorus
im paralyzed where are my feelings
i no longer feel things i know i should
im paralyzed where is the real me
im lost and it kills me inside im paralyzed

bridge
im paralyzed
im scared to live but im scared to die
and if life is pain then i buried mine
a long time ago but its still alive
and its takin over me where am i
i wanna feel somethin im numb inside
but i dont feel nothin i wonder why
im in the race of life and time passed by
look i sit back and i watch it
hands in my pockets
waves come crashin over me but i just watch em
i just watch em
im underwater but i feel like im on top of it
im at the bottom but i dont know what the problem is
im in a box but im the one that locked me in
im paralyzed suffocatin and im runnin out of oxygen ah
