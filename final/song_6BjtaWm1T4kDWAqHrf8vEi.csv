aint nobody else saying shit
daytrip took it to ten hey

chorus
i usually have an answer to the question but this time im gon be quiet this time
aint nothing like the feeling of uncertainty the eeriness of silence
this time it was so unexpected
last time it was the drugs he was lacing
all legends fall in the making yeah sorry truth uh
dying young uh demon youth
