i tried an idea for no reason
keep the sun off my shoulders crawling back to

chorus
a black out
touching new life
face down
set the pace again
set the pace again

verse 1
the drive the idea still existing
sat and shuddered broke the pattern falling inward
in and down up and out let it go fall away back
call it off any day anyway make you feel this

chorus
a black out
touching new life
face down
set the pace again

chorus
a black out
touching new life
face down
set the pace again

dont take the fall wed hate to see
thats entertainment get some
eyes on the goal last one to get
is passed over looked over

never rehearse theyve spiked the water
its in the blood get some
weve underestimated
how can i get some
how can i how can i how can i get some
how can i how can i how can i get some

chorus
a black out
touching new life
face down
set the pace again

chorus
a black out
touching new life
face down
set the pace again

outro
a black out could this be the one
a black out could this be the one
a black out could this be the one
a black out could this be the oneembed"
