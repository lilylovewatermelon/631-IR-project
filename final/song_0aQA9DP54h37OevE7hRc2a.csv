verse 1
late nights late nights starin out the window doin 85
got my state of mind
yeah walkin on that gray line
hopin that my stress dies
its like i hate it but i love it at the same time oh same time
pressure pushin me from all sides
insecurities of all kinds all kinds
yeah im a hostage to my own pride
most important things in life to me are things i know i cant buy oh
ayy yeah its me in phases
im not in the mood yeah to meet another stranger
im not in the mood yeah to have a conversation
and talk about a bunch of things that i dont feel amazed with
gettin too close to me oh woo could be dangerous
i dont like the energy i leave the situation
all this negativity that i cant get away from
all this negativity i think i need a break from
im thankful butâ€¦ oh

my inner critic talks im just hopin that god helps me to stop stressin
