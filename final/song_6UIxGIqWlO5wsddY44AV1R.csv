she says wake up its no use pretending
ill keep stealing breathing her
birds are leaving over autumns ending
one of us will die inside these arms

eyes wide open
naked as we came
one will spread our ashes round the yard

she says if i leave before you darling
dont you waste me in the ground
i lay smiling like our sleeping children
one of us will die inside these arms
