no i was just telling that i i got this this girl before
and i was together since three years
and uh i was not even cheating her or what
and facebook arrived and uh
she wanted me to accept her on facebook
and i dont want it because i was like in front of her
in front of her and she told me like accept me on facebook
it was virtual means no sense
so i say im in front of you i dont need to accept you on facebook
she starting to be crazy
she thought that because i didnt accept her she thought i was cheating
she told me like uh its its over i cant believe you
i said come on youre crazy because like yeah
