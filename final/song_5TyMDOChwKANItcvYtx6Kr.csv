patient anticipation
up till now ive been hurry up and waiting
at a bus stop in independence licking an ice cream cone
ive been kicking ive been scheming
this is as close as ive ever been to leaving
five blocks away a stones throw from home
but im as good as gone

chorus
i gotta get gone gone gone
shooting like a gun a gun a gun
skipping like a stone stone stone
far as i can run to where freedom is free
theres a road like a long gray ribbon far as i can see
and its pulling independence out of me

verse 2
emancipation or paper chasing
leaving with question marks and mommas blessing
put her picture in my pocket along with her rosary
some say im crazy a little loco
and most of my friends will live and die in this zip code
it might be for me but until i go
how am i ever supposed to know
you might also likechorus
i gotta get gone gone gone
shooting like a gun a gun a gun
skipping like a stone stone stone
far as i can run to where freedom is free
theres a road like a long gray ribbon far as i can see

bridge
im busting out of independence
independences busting out of me
im busting out of independence
independences busting out of me

chorus
i gotta get gone gone gone
shooting like a gun a gun a gun
skipping like a stone stone stone
far as i can run to where freedom is free
theres a road like a long gray ribbon far as i can see
theres a road like a long gray ribbon far as i can see
