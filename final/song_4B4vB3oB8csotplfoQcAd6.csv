weep for yourself my man
youll never be what is in your heart
weep little lion man
youre not as brave as you were at the start
rate yourself and rake yourself
take all the courage you have left
and waste it on fixing all the problems
that you made in your own head

verse 2
tremble for yourself my man
you know that you have seen this all before
tremble little lion man

your grace is wasted in your face
your boldness stands alone among the wreck
now learn from your mother
or else spend your days biting your own neck

but it was not your fault but mine
and it was your heart on the line
