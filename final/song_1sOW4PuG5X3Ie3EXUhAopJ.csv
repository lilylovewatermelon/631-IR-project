you pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
they buy you bags and jewelry yeah
they think your kindness is so weak
no you dont give it up so easy baby
but you just wanted my attention
you just wanted my affection
you got me tattooed on your mind
you just want me all the time
well figure out our shit and find a way oh yeah
when you say that you need space i give you space you space
girl when youre ready you know where i stay
when it comes to all these hoes ill never chase
but this world is such a such an evil place
man these hoes will always find a way
cause when im on the liquor i go crazy
and for that pussy you know im a slave yeah

gave you everything you wanted
but none of that matters to you ohoh

she pulled up to the studio
nobodys watching
she closed the door and then she locked it
for me for me
we had sex in the studio
nobody walked in
i cut my verse and then she popped it
for me for me
la girls all look the same
i cant recognize
the same work done on they face
i dont criticize
she a coldhearted bitch with no shame
but her throat too fire
she got chrome hearts hangin from her neck
and them shits going wild
when she ride she hold tight
she gon ride til sweat fall down her spine
shes all mine for the night
shes all mine until he calls her line
outro
she pulled up to the studio
nobodys watching
she closed the door and then she locked it
for me for me
we had sex in the studio
nobody walked in
i cut my verse and then she popped it
for me for me
ohoh ohoh70embed"
