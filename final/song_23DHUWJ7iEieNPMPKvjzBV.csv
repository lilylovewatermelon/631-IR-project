hey there
i know its hard to feel like i dont care at all
where you are and how you feel
with these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on and on and on and on
slow things down or speed them up
not enough or way too much
and on and on and on how are you when im gone

chorus
and i cant make it on my own
and i cant make it on my own
because my heart is in ohio
so cut my wrists and black my eyes
cut my wrists and black my eyes
so i can fall asleep tonight or die

postchorus
because you kill me
you know you do you kill me well
you like it too and i can tell
youll never stop until my final breath is gone

verse 2
spare me just three last words i love you is all she heard
ill wait for you but i cant wait forever
spare me just three last words i love you is all she heard
ill wait for you but i cant wait forever
