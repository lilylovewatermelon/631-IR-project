blood is pouring
sleep is boring
dont stop running
im here counting

the life the hurt the pain the hate
the life the hurt the pain the hate
the life the hurt the pain the hate
will it keep fucking with me
theres nowhere else to go

prechorus
so i walk but seem to crawl
for ive given in today
now i run into a wall
cause i cannot find my way

chorus
ahh youve gotta come with me
i cannot stand this place
ahh were falling off the world
and ill give in this way
ahh we had a chance to run
and now i cant believe
ahh were going all the way
and im in deaths embrace
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
my life worry
life is story
give up beating
ill start healing

the life the hurt the pain the hate
the life the hurt the pain the hate
the life the hurt the pain the hate
will it keep fucking with me
theres nowhere else to go

prechorus
so i walk but seem to crawl
for ive given in today
now i run into a wall
cause i cannot find my way

chorus
ahh youve gotta come with me
i cannot stand this place
ahh were falling off the world
and ill give in this way
ahh we had a chance to run
and now i cant believe
ahh were going all the way
and im in deaths embrace
refrain
embrace embrace embrace embrace
embrace embrace embrace embrace
oh aah
oh oh oh oh aah
oh oh oh oh aah
oh oh oh oh aah
oh oh oh oh

bridge
what really do i have to follow
nothing makes sense at all
taking something for nothing
watch me as i fall

im bringing me down
im bringing me down
im bringing me down
im bringing me down

chorus
ahh youve gotta come with me
i cannot stand this place
ahh were falling off the world
and ill give in this way
ahh we had a chance to run
and now i cant believe
ahh were going all the way
and im in deaths embrace
ahh youve gotta come with me
i cannot stand this place
ahh were falling off the world
and ill give in this way
ahh we had a chance to run
and now i cant believe
ahh were going all the way
and im in deaths embrace2embed"
