you are relentless
i am defenseless

your whisper so clear
the world disappears
as i fall into the darkness
its impossible to express
how good it feels
im wrapped up im sealed
so tired ill never be free
all night dont fight the feeling

get back in my life
come knock on my door
what im looking for

burned me to the floor
