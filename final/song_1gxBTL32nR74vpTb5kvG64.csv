heard a couple songs now they thinking that they know me
i aint taking calls to the world im always roaming
never need the time so i never had a rollie
do it just us so we never hear you owe me
making sure we straight we put the money where we need to
couple commas later it aint even been a week to
blow the world a kiss and tell it ill be back
never i got weather to be weathered
theres some hands up to be severed
but theres a seed i gotta plant
theres a line to be drawn
in the dirt in the earth 150 feet down
i dont believe in the shit but its heaven and its hell
could have took a l with the label
instead i make bands with el what
