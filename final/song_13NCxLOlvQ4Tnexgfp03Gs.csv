well the mourning was complete
when there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
id have the cheek to say theyre equally as bleak

verse 2
its the beginning of the end
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone theyll tell you that its these times that it tends
to start to break in half to start to fall apart hold on to your heart

chorus
and do me a favour and break my nose
or do me a favour and tell me to go away
or do me a favour and stop asking questions

verse 3
as she walked away well her shoes were untied
and the eyes were all red you could see that wed cried
and i watched and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold will force you to be cold

do me a favour and ask if you need some help
she said do me a favour and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps fuck off might be too kind
perhaps fuck off might be too kind62embed"
