she moved up to the city
became a big time fashion designer
all them big shots wined and dined her
all those fancy restaurants
she came back to our hometown
pulled up in a brandnew lexus
looks like our little girl from texas
had joined the upper echelon

chorus
and she walked through the door
in her jeans and her boots
stepped right back
into her tonkin roots
neath the neon lights
we raised the roof
way into the night
now you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
into that uptown world
but shes still my little good timin beer drinkin pool shootin
honky tonk girl

verse 2
once upon another time
before she moved to the big apple
wedding bells were gonna ring in a country chapel
for me and my downhome debutante
said she missed what we had
and though she made a darn good livin
money couldnt buy what shed been missin
yeah that girl knows what she wants
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
and she walked through the door
in her jeans and her boots
stepped right back
into her tonkin roots
neath the neon lights
we raised the roof
way into the night
now you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
into that uptown world
but shes still my little good timin beer drinkin pool shootin
honky tonk girl

tag
well you can take the girl out of the honky tonk
into that uptown world
but shes still my little good timin beer drinkin pool shootin
honky tonk girl
honky tonk girlembed"
