daddy sits on a front porch swinging
looking out on a vacant field
used to be filled with burley tbacca
now he knows it never will
my brothers found work in indiana
m sisters a nurse at the old folks home
mama still cooking too much for supper
and me i’ve been a long time gone

chorus
been a long time gone
no i aint hoed a row since i dont know when
long time gone
and it aint coming back again

verse 2
deliah plays that ol church piana
sitting out on her daddy’s farm
she always thought that wed be together
lord i never meant to do her harm
said she could hear me singin in the choir
me i heard another song
i caught wind and hit the road runnin
and lord ive been a long time gone
you might also likechorus
been a long time gone
lord i aint had a prayer since i dont know when
long time gone
and it aint coming back again

bridge
now me i went to nashville
tryin to beat the big deal
playin down on broadway
gettin there the hard way
living from a tip jar
sleeping in my car
hocking my guitar
yeah i’m gonna be a star

verse 3
now me and deliah singing every sunday
watching the children and the garden grow
we listen to the radio to hear whats cookin’
but the music aint got no soul
now they sound tired but they dont sound haggard
theyve got money but they dont have cash
they got junior but they dont have hank
i think i think i think
outro
the rest is a long time gone
no i aint hit the roof since i don’t know when
long time gone
and it aint coming back
i said a long time gone
no i aint honked the horn since i don’t know when
long time gone
and it aint coming back again
i said a long time long time long time gone
well it’s been a long time
long time long time long time gone
oh its been a long time gone
long time long time long time gone
