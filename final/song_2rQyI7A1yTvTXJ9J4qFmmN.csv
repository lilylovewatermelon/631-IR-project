ive got some big news
the bank finally came through
and im holding the keys to
a brandnew chevrolet
have you been outside
it sure is a nice night
how about a little test drive
down by the lake

prechorus
theres a place i know about
where the dirt road runs out
and we can try out the fourwheel drive
come on now what do you say
girl i can hardly wait
to get a little mud on the tires

chorus
cause its a good night
to be out there soakin up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shoreline
ive got the perfect place in mind
its in the middle of nowhere
only one way to get there
you gotta get a little mud on the tires

moonlight on a duck blind
catfish on a trot line
sun sets about nine
this time of year
we can throw a blanket down
crickets singing in the background
and more stars than you can count
on a night this clear

prechorus
i tell you what we need to do
is grab a sleeping bag or two
and build us a little campfire
and then with a little luck
we might just get stuck
lets get a little mud on the tires

chorus
cause its a good night
to be out there soakin up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shoreline
ive got the perfect place in mind
its in the middle of nowhere
only one way to get there
you gotta get a little mud on the tires
outro
and then with a little luck
we might just get stuck
lets get a little mud on the tires3embed"
