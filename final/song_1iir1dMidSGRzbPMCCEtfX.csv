are we growing up or just going down
its just a matter of time until were all found out
take our tears put em on ice
cause i swear id burn this city down to show you the light

verse 1 patrick stump
were the therapists pumping through your speakers
delivering just what you need
were wellread and poised
were the best boys
were the chemists whove found the formula
to make your heart swell and burst
no matter what they say
dont believe a word

prechorus patrick stump
cause ill keep singing this lie if youll keep believing it
and ill keep singing this lie ill keep singing this lie

chorus patrick stump
are we growing up or just going down
its just a matter of time until were all found out
take our tears put em on ice
cause i swear id burn this city down to show you the light

were traveled like gypsies only
with worse luck and far less gold
were the kids you used to love
but then we grew old
were the lifers here til the bitter end
condemned from the start
ashamed of the way the songs and the
words own the words own the beating of our hearts

prechorus patrick stump
cause ill keep singing this lie ill keep singing this lie

chorus patrick stump
are we growing up or just going down
its just a matter of time until were all found out
take our tears put em on ice
cause i swear id burn this city down to show you the light

postchorus patrick stump
and theres a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
and theres another around to help us bend your trust
got a sunset in my veins
and i need to take a pill to make this town feel okay

the best part of believe is the lie
i hope you sing along and you steal a line
i need to keep you like this in my mind
so give in or just give up
the best part of believe is the lie
i hope you sing along and you steal a line
i need to keep you like this in my mind
so give in or just give up
are we growing up or just going down
