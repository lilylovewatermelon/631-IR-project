verse 1 2pac
woke up with 50 enemies plottin my death
all 50 seein visions of me shot in the chest
couldnt rest nah nigga i was stressed
had me creepin round corners homie sleepin in my vest
shit im like a hostage on this troubled block
call the cops a thug nigga screamin westside
bustin double glocks hittin corners in my chevy suburban
liquor got me drivin up on the curb
hand on the steerin wheel swervin
bless me father im a sinner im livin in hell
just let me live on the streets ‘cause aint no peace for me in jail
gettin worldwide exposure
with a bunch of niggas that dont give a fuck ridin as my soldiers
i just release em on a war path not your average dealer

complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
i murdered all them bustas now im the last motherfucker breathin
