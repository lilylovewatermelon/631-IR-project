chorus
yeah why dont you wake up from your bad dreams
whens the last time you took a little time for yourself
theres no reason to be so down
rather fly around like theres no ground
and i i bet you wish you had these
cause carrying this weightll break your glass knees
yeah dont need no chauffeur fuck the backseat
no i stay behind the wheel and never halfspeed

verse
get the fuck out of my car this aint a taxi
they love to see me lonely hate to see me happy
call me what you want she call me daddy
got a knack for gettin nasty every day we keepin tally yeah
ooh its true i want it badly
hit the zoom i be movin like a athlete
now concentrate no reason to be that upset
im busy trippin bout some shit that still aint even happen yet
i keep it honest as honesty gets
dont know why im always talkin if im not makin sense
ive spent my life livin with a lot of regrets
you throw me off my high horse id probably fall to my death
bad behavior its obvious youre not on your best
i might just pull your card if its on top of the deck
give me give me what i need and then im onto the next
thats what we callin cause and effect
