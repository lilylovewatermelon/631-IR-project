yeah
you make me feel so alienated alienated
yeah
ooh ooh yeah yeah
whatever you do

verse 1
since ive become a shooting star
ive been wondering where you are
seems like youre forever in a getaway
momma told me that it would happen to me one day
feels like weve been apart for some light years
crater in my heart fill with my tears
stars align ill be your girl again
what im tryin to say i want you back in my world again

bridge
youre the reason i dont change my number
dont you know its still the same
and i bet you remember that summer
when we kicked it everyday
dont know how it happened just happened
kinda like we faded away
and i feel so alienated dont you feel so alienated

i miss you and i want you back
i lost your signal where you at
and i dont know how we lost contact
where did you go im searching for you
cant get you outta my system
outta my system outta my system
cant get you outta my system
outta my system outta my system
cant get you outta my system
outta my system outta my system
where did you go im searching for you

verse 2
sitting watching time passing by me
voices in my head asking why me
im here wishing you would stop by my place
but the only time we talk is on myspace
by the way have you found my replacement
she should be the one on this spaceship
waking up reaching for you when youre not there
you got me in another galaxy im out there

bridge
youre the reason i dont change my number
dont you know its still the same
ooh and i know you remember that summer
when we kicked it everyday
dont know how it happened just happened
kinda like we faded away
and i feel so alienated dont you feel so alienated
chorus
