broken hearts and last goodbyes
restless nights by lullabies helps make this pain go away
i realize i let you down told you that id be around
building up the strength just to say

chorus jonas brothers
im sorry for breaking all the promises
that i wasnt around to keep
you told me this time is the last time
i will ever beg you to stay
but youre already on your way

verse 2 nick jonas
filled with sorrow filled with pain
knowing that i am to blame for leaving your heart out in the rain
and i know youre gonna walk away
leave me with the price to pay before you go i wanted to say
yeah

chorus jonas brothers
that im sorry for breaking all the promises
that i wasnt around to keep
you told me this time is the last time
i will ever beg you to stay
but youre already on your way

i cant make it alive on my own
but if you have to go then please girl just leave me alone
cause i dont wanna see you and me going our separate ways
begging you to stay if it isnt too late

chorus jonas brothers
im sorry for breaking all the promises
that i wasnt around to keep
you told me this time is the last time
i will ever beg you to stay
but youre already on your way
