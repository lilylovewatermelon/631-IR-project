verse 1 mark hoppus
its hard to wake up
when the shades have been pulled shut
this house is haunted its so pathetic
it makes no sense at all
im ripe with things to say
the words rot and fall away
what stupid poem could fix this home
id read it every day

chorus tom delonge
so heres your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away
it was mine so when youre dead and gone
will you remember this night twenty years now lost

postchorus tom delonge
its not right

verse 2 mark hoppus
their anger hurts my ears
been running strong for seven years
rather than fix the problems
they never solve them it makes no sense at all
i see them everyday
we get along so why cant they
if this is what he wants and its what she wants
then whys there so much pain

so heres your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away
it was mine so when youre dead and gone
will you remember this night twenty years now lost
