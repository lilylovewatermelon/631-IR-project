i missed your 21st birthday ive been up at home
almost tried to call you dont know if i should
hate to picture you halfdrunk happy
hate to think you went out without me
im sorry if you blame me if i were you i would
thought youd see it comin but you never could
i still havent heard from your family
but you said your mom always loved me

prechorus
sometimes i go blurryeyed
small talk and you tell me that youre on fire
lights on and its black and white i couldnt stay forever

chorus
i see the look in your eye and im bitin my tongue
youll be the love of my life when i was young
when the night is over
dont call me up im already under
i get a little bit alone sometimes and i miss you again
ill be the love of your life inside your head
when the night is over
dont call me up im already under

verse 2
audrey said she saw you out past twelve oclock
just because youre hurtin doesnt mean im not
if it doesnt go away by the time i turn thirty
i made a mistake and ill tell you im sorry
sorry

chorus
i see the look in your eye and im bitin my tongue
youll be the love of my life when i was young
when the night is over

ill be the love of your life inside your head
when the night is over
