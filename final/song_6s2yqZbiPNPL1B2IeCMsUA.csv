now come one come all to this tragic affair
wipe off that makeup whats in is despair
so throw on the black dress mix in with the lot
you might wake up and notice youre someone youre not
if you look in the mirror and dont like what you see
you can find out firsthand what its like to be me
so gather round piggies and kiss this goodbye
id encourage your smiles ill expect you wont cry
interlude

verse 2
another contusion my funeral jag
heres my resignation ill serve it in drag
youve got front row seats to the penitence ball
when i grow up i want to be nothing at all
