when i say i want you girl i mean it
when i say i love you youre gonna feel it
each and everyday i go out of my way above and beyond
just so you dont have to wonder
youre the one i want

verse 2
gonna write you love songs to show my feelings
i could tell you but id rather sing it
throw your name in the chorus of a love song story so catchy
make everybody wanna sing along
just so you dont have to wonder
youre the one i want

verse 3
dont have all the answers when i take the floor
when it comes to uncertainty ive never been more sure
darling when it comes to you ive never had a doubt
youre the face of the woman in my dreams
ive been dreaming about

verse 4
gonna take you dancing when we get home
youll cry because youre happy and that your love has grown
and ill kiss you on the forehead and say baby whats wrong
youll say nothing
i just love you cause you never made me wonder
youre the one i wantsee flatland cavalry liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeembed"
