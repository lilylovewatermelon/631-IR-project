see growing up i
i always felt like i had to be the best at everything
cause i i just didnt think i was good enough
and and maybe if i was good at something that id get recognition from that but
i quickly found out that i wasnt gonna get the recognition that i wanted or that i needed because
because people arent perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
and with god its like hes perfect
and he never disappoints
so i just get my recognition from him
and give him recognition7embed"
