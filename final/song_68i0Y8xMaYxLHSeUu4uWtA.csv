and i have traveled such a distance just to see the smile thats on your face
and i have traveled far and wide and i have died and lived and flown through time and space
and the most familiar happiness ive ever known is here with me again
tucked away inside my home this rolling stone has found a rock to call his friend

chorus
and if you wonder where my heart is when im out on the road
its right at home i left it honey just for you to hold
and if you wonder how im doin know that i am doin fine
but i wish i was in virginia on the russell country linе

verse 2
captivated by your beauty i look at you and see the onе i love
reunited in this tomb where our pride died and is buried from above
and in that dirt was planted seeds of hope and from them grew the flowers of our lives
and all our favourite little things that true loves brings all the times we laughed and cried

chorus
and if you wonder where my heart is when im out on the road
its right at home i left it honey just for you to hold
and if you wonder how im doin know that i am doin fine
but i wish i was in virginia on the russell country line

chorus
