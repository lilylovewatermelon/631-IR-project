living with me
i dont think it would be so bad
this is the first time this year
that im not going to make you mad
im tired of my conscious
always telling me to stop sleeping in
but i cant waste a second
on dreams that will never begin

chorus 1
everyone has a head upon their shoulders
were losing our pride as we all get older
everyone has to become their saviors
you might not get it right
or you might realize that its too late

chorus 2
dont back down
im over the past
cant you see
dont back down
i dont really care about before
before you met me

verse 2
is it cool if i see you tonight
theres a thousand questions
i want to ask you
if you think that its alright
you might also likechorus 1

chorus 2

bridge
so dont take anything for granted
sit outside in the rain
an excuse you know i planned it
every ending ends up the same
