you dont need a girl like me
ive got bruises you cant see
and when the lights go out
i wont be around
you dont need a girl like me

verse 2
you cant have a heart like mine
but you can hold it for a while
and when the lights go out
i wont be around
you cant have a heart like mine

chorus
theres a rule that goes unwritten
and i break it from time to time
if youre fool enough to listen
then im fool enough to lie

verse 3
thats the kind of girl i am
i take off before i land
and even though you think you can
you cant change the way i am
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
cause the rule remains unwritten
i still break it from time to time
if youre fool enough to listen
then im fool enough to lie

outro
you cant change the way i am
you dont need a girl like meembed"
