im running out of faith
be careful who you tell
im running out of faith
be careful who you tell

verse 1
shes blackening my name
my army never came
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell

chorus
cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty filthy soul
dont ya know its out of your control

verse 2
shes blackening my name
i know you feel the same
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell

stop squeezing on my neck
your unemployment check
its water under the bridge
be careful who you tell
you might also likechorus
cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty filthy soul
dont ya know its out of your control

bridge
waiting on a blood line
you can find some free time
look at who youre hating
now youre celebrating

waiting on a blood line
you can find some free time

waiting on a blood line
waiting on a blood line
waiting on a blood line

verse 3
shes blackening my name
be careful who you tell

chorus
cause you gotta look her in the eye
and you gotta love your way of life
cause you got a guilty filthy soul
dont ya know its out of your control11embed"
