that old picture frame keeps hanging around
cause i aint ready yet to take it down
but every now and then ill slam the door
shake it loose and shell hit the floor
but i cant throw a good thing away
i wish it would break
i swear my trucks got a haunted radio
cause i hear you in every song
but i know what the silence makes me do
so i keep giving those buttons more abuse
i wonder how much punching it can take
i wish it would break

chorus
then i could move on right on
down the line
where i dont see you need you
in my life
but youre wrapped around me
your memorys bound me like a chain
i wish it would break

verse 2
and this old heart of mines got a mind of its own
and its decided not to let you go
even though your loves no longer here
it wont let me shed one tear
cause its still holding onto yesterday
i wish it would break

outro
i wish it would break
i wish it would break
go on and breakembed"
