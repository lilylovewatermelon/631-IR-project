and youre tired of your mum and youre tired of your dad
got you jumping through hoops got you shaving your legs
let it pass let it pass let it pass over you
and youre tired of your face and youre tired of your nose
got you jumping through hoops got you shaving your legs
let it pass let it pass let it pass through you

and your nose is bleeding
and your nose is bleeding
youve been lying to me
and your nose is bleeding
and your nose is bleeding
youve been lying to me

verse 2 kele okereke
there will be no hesitation there will be no confrontation
there will be no indication there will be no cause
there will be no exultation there will be no justification
there will be no way at all

chorus kele okereke
and your nose is bleeding
and your nose is bleeding
youve been lying to me
and your nose is bleeding
and your nose is bleeding
youve been lying to me
