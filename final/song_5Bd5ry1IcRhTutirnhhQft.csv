you could hear the wind howling across the ocean
and the taste of the wine and the buzzed feel in my head
and the only wifi was burning right beside me
and we had us a night ill never forget
she was a 1960s beach boys song
and were living that dream all night long

chorus
in that california sunrise
in that california sunrise
she took me to heaven and so much more
like nothing ive ever seen before
in that california sunrise

verse 2
pretty soon it was raining up in seattle
and it sure was cold out in colorado
yeah i was missing her kiss in the heat of arizona
been everywhere and nothing could compare
yeah to that one of a kind trip i was on
everything about her felt like home

chorus
in that california sunrise
in that california sunrise
she took me to heaven and so much more
like nothing ive ever seen before
in that california sunrise
take me on back
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likebridge
found her number in a pocket of my blue jeans
picked up the phone and let it ring
said im counting down the miles back to you babe
yeah im heading west on a big old jet plane

chorus
back to that california sunrise
that california sunrise
she took me to heaven and so much more
like nothing ive ever seen before
in that california sunrise
take me on back
that california sunrise
that california sunrise
that california sunrise
that california sunrise
take me on backembed"
