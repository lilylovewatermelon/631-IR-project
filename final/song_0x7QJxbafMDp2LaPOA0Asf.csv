i got a story its almost finished
now all i need is someone to tell it to
maybe thats you
our time is borrowed and spent too freely
every minute i have needs to be made up
but how
im looking for a nice way to say im out
i want out

verse 2
i fall asleep with my friends around me
only place i know i feel safe
im gonna call this home
the open road is still miles away
hey nothing serious
we still have our fun
oh we had it once

prechorus
but windows open and close
thats just how it goes

chorus
dont it feel like sunshine after all
the world we love forever gone
were only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likeverse 3
im in love with the ordinary
i need a simple space
to rest my head
then everything gets clear
well im a little ashamed for asking
but just a little helps
it gets me straight again
helps me get over it over it

prechorus
it might seem like a dream
but its real to me

chorus
dont it feel like sunshine after all
the world we loved forever gone
were only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

verse 4
you should see the canals are freezing
you should see me high
you should just be here
be with me here
it doesnt seem theres hope for me
i let you down
but i wont give in now
not for any amount
chorus
dont it feel like sunshine after all
the world we love forever gone
were only just as happy as everyone else thinks

now dont that feel like sunshine after all
the world we love forever gone
were only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we areembed"
