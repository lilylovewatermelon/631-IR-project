search in circles everytime i try
ive been here before
ive seen you before

i cant escape walking down these halls
hard to find a place where there are no walls
and no lines begging me to cross
only straight ahead better move along

like clockwork i commit the crime
i pretend to be everything they like
ive been here before
ive seen you before

i cant escape walking down these halls
hard to find a place where there are no walls
and no lines begging me to cross
only straight ahead better move along

and i trade everything for this
and i trade everything for this
why do i read the writing on the wall
why do i read the writing on the wall

i dont wanna lose my place in line
ive been here too long
and ive spent too much time
i dont wanna lose my place in line
ive been here too long
and ive spent too much time
see trapt liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likesomething missing left behind
search in circles everytime i try
ive been here before
ive seen you before

i cant escape walking down these halls
hard to find a place where there are no walls
and no lines begging me to cross
only straight ahead better move along

and i trade everything for this
and i trade everything for this
why do i read the writing on the wall
why do i read the writing on the wall
why do i read the writing on the wall
why do i read the writing on the wallembed"
