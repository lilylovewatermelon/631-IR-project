1986 harley
blowing smoke and sucking oil
my daddy said buy it and you are crazy boy
you cannot tell me nothing
it took two months to fix it up
and one day to lay her down
i got a little hitch in my getalong now
you cannot tell me nothing

chorus
talk is cheap and free advice
is worth the price you pay
i had to find out for myself the hard way
you cannot tell me nothing

verse 2
hometown homecoming sweetheart
nobody thought i had a prayer
her mama said boy do not you come around here
cannot tell me nothing
they say be careful what you wish for
i want to be her man
two babies and a trailer later here i am
cannot tell me nothing
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
talk is cheap and free advice
is worth the price you pay
i had to find out for myself the hard way
you cannot tell me nothing

verse 3
they say drinking will kill you
the same thing for rolling smokes
but that is two of the three things that i like most
cannot tell me nothing
i know what the good book preaches
but i know how i am
i just hope somebody up there understands
cannot tell me nothingembed"
