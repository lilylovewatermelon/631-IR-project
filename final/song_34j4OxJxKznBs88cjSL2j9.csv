yo first i snatched the streets then i snatched the charts

rappers came and went ive been here from the start

when you hot im hot
and when your feet cold mines is sizzling
its plain to see niggas cant fuck with me

verse 2 kanye west
i get down for my grandfather who took my momma
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sitins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
but we can make it to jacobs or to the dealership
thats why i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racism still alive they just be concealin it
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sams club
i done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
swear ive been baptized least three or four times
but in the land where niggas praise yukons and getting paid
its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
so i promised to mr rainey im gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you seen the car i bought her
and you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side
chorus
when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing ive found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get down get up i get down
get up i get down get up i get down
get up i get down get up i get down
verse 3 j ivy
we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you dont need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious
thats why i expose my soul to the globe the world
im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
im not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this thats why i get spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so its not me its he thats lyrical
im not a miracle im a heavensent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
thats why im instrumental vibrations is what im into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
im trying to get us us free like cinque
i cant stop thats why im hot
determination dedication motivation
im talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
and you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cause whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth
a touch of god reigns out
take em to church
chorus
when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get get up i get
get up i get get up i get
get up i get get up i get down
verse 4 jayz  kanye west
