or hanging out in the corner of my mind
stringing up the gallow
waiting on me to cross that line
that mans dangerous as hell a threat to himself
if he got out thered be hell to pay
and thats why my dark side dont ever see the light of day

i slowed down on the whiskey
cause there always came a point
when id have one too many
tear down every wall in that joint
i got a wife and got a son
that dont know half the stuff ive done
and i pray thats the way it stays
and thats why my dark side dont ever see the light of day
you can blame it on my rebel raisin blame it on the south
you can blame it on the words i try to keep here in my mouth
it takes a lot to start me up but once that hammer drops
you dont want to be the one that tries to make me stop
all you thugs and ugly mugs dealing drugs and making noise
you can kill each other all you want
but if you touch my little boy
you begging for this bullet will be the last thing that you say
before i let my dark side ha ha come out to playsee eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also like1embed"
