jean toomer


oracular
redolent of fermenting syrup
purple of the dusk
deeprooted cane
karintha

her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon
o cant you see it o cant you see it
her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon
 when the sun goes down

men had always wanted her this karintha even as a child karintha carrying beauty perfect as dusk when the sun goes down old men rode her hobbyhorse upon their knees young men danced with her at frolics when thеy should have been dancing with their grownup girls god grant us youth secrеtly prayed the old men the young fellows counted the time to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them this interest of the male who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon could mean no good to her

karintha at twelve was a wild flash that told the other folks just what it was to live at sunset when there was no wind and the pinesmoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth and you couldnt see more than a few feet in front her sudden darting past you was a bit of vivid color like a black bird that flashes in light with the other children one could hear some distance off their feet flopping in the twoinch dust karintha’s running was a whir it had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road at dusk during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down and before any of the women had started their suppergettingready songs her voice highpitched shrill would put one’s ears to itching but no one ever thought to make her stop because of it she stoned the cows and beat her dog and fought the other children even the preacher who caught her at mischief told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a november cotton flower already rumors were out about her homes in georgia are most often built on the tworoom plan in one you cook and eat in the other you sleep and there love goes on karintha had seen or heard perhaps she had felt her parents loving one could but imitate one’s parents for to follow them was the way of god she played “home” with a small boy who was not afraid to do her bidding that started the whole thing old men could no longer ride her hobbyhorse upon their knees but young men counted faster

her skin is like dusk
o cant you see it
her skin is like dusk
when the sun goes down
karintha is a woman she who carries beauty perfect as dusk when the sun goes down she has been married many times old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobbyhorse upon their knees karintha smiles and indulges them when she is in the mood for it she has contempt for them karintha is a woman young men run stills to make her money young men go to the big cities and run on the road young men go away to college they all want to bring her money these are the young men who thought that all they had to do was to count time but karintha is a woman and she has had a child a child fell out of her womb onto a bed of pineneedles in the forest pineneedles are smooth and sweet they are elastic to the feet of rabbits a sawmill was nearby its pyramidal sawdust pile smouldered it is a year before one completely burns meanwhile the smoke curls up and hangs in odd wraiths about the trees curls up and spreads itself out over the valley weeks after karintha returned home the smoke was so heavy you tasted it in water some one made a song

smoke is on the hills rise up
smoke is on the hills o rise
and take my soul to jesus

karintha is a woman men do not know that the soul of her was a growing thing ripened too soon they will bring their money they will die not having found it out karintha at twenty carrying beauty perfect as dusk when the sun goes down karintha

her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon
o cant you see it o cant you see it
her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon
 when the sun goes down
goes down



song of the son

pour o pour that parting soul in song
o pour it in the sawdust glow of night
into the velvet pinesmoke air tonight
and let the valley carry it along
and let the valley carry it along
o land and soil red soil and sweetgum tree
so scant of grass so profligate of pines
now just before an epoch’s sun declines
thy son in time i have returned to thee
thy son i have in time returned to thee
in time for though the sun is setting on
a songlit race of slaves it has not set
though late o soil it is not too late yet
to catch thy plaintive soul leaving soon gone
leaving to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone
o negro slaves dark purple ripened plums
squeezed and bursting in the pinewood air
passing before they stripped the old tree bare
one plum was saved for me one seed becomes
an everlasting song a singing tree
caroling softly souls of slavery
what they were and what they are to me
caroling softly souls of slavery



kabnis

ralph kabnis propped in his bed tries to read to read himself to sleep an oil lamp on a chair near his elbow burns unsteadily the cabin room is spaced fantastically about it whitewashed hearth and chimney black with sooty sawteeth ceiling patterned by the fringed globe of the lamp the walls unpainted are seasoned a rosin yellow and cracks between the boards are black these cracks are the lips the night winds use for whispering night winds in georgia are vagrant poets whispering kabnis against his will lets his book slip down and listens to them the warm whiteness of his bed the lamplight do not protect him from the weird chill of their song

whiteman’s land
niggers sing
burn bear black children
till poor rivers bring
rest and sweet glory
in camp ground

kabnis’ thin hair is streaked on the pillow his hand strokes the slim silk of his mustache his thumb pressed under his chin seems to be trying to give squareness and projection to it brown eyes stare from a lemon face moisture gathers beneath his armpits he slides down beneath the cover seeking release

kabnis near me now whoever you are my warm glowing sweetheart do not think that the face that rests beside you is the real kabnis ralph kabnis is a dream and dreams are faces with large eyes and weak chins and broad brows that get smashed by the fists of square faces the body of the world is bullnecked a dream is a soft face that fits uncertainly upon it god if i could develop that in words give what i know a bullneck and a heaving body all would go well with me wouldnt it sweetheart if i could feel that i came to the south to face it if i the dream not what is weak and afraid in me could become the face of the south how my lips would sing for it my songs being the lips of its soul soul soul hell there aint no such thing what in hell was that

a rat had run across the thin boards of the ceiling kabnis thrusts his head out from the covers through the cracks a powdery faded red dust sprays down on him dust of slavefields dried scattered no use to read christ if he only could drink himself to sleep something as sure as fate was going to happen he couldnt stand this thing much longer a hen perched on a shelf in the adjoining room begins to tread her nails scrape the soft wood her feathers ruffle

“get out of that you egglaying bitch”

kabnis hurls a slipper against the wall the hen flies from her perch and cackles as if a skunk were after her
“now cut out that racket or i’ll wring your neck for you”

answering cackles arise in the chicken yard

“why in christ’s hell cant you leave me alone damn it i wish your cackle would choke you choke every mother’s son of them in this godforsaken hole go away by god i’ll wring your neck for you if you dont hell of a mess i’ve got in even the poultry is hostile go way go way by god i’ll”

kabnis jumps from his bed his eyes are wild he makes for the door bursts through it the hen driving blindly at the windowpane screams then flies and flops around trying to elude him kabnis catches her

“got you now you shebitch”

with his fingers about her neck he thrusts open the outside door and steps out into the serene loveliness of georgian autumn moonlight some distance off down in the valley a band of pinesmoke silvered gauze drifts steadily the halfmoon is a white child that sleeps upon the treetops of the forest white winds croon its sleepsong

rock aby baby
black mother sways holding a white child on her bosom
when the bough bends
her breath hums through pinecones
cradle will fall
teat moonchildren at your breasts
down will come baby
black mother


kabnis whirls the chicken by its neck and throws the head away picks up the hopping body warm sticky and hides it in a clump of bushes he wipes blood from his hands onto the coarse scant grass

kabnis thats done old chromo in the big house there will wonder whats become of her pet hen well it’ll teach her a lesson not to make a hencoop of my quarters quarters hell of a fine quarters i’ve got five years ago look at me now earth’s child the earth my mother god is a profligate rednosed man about town bastardy me a bastard son has got a right to curse his maker god

kabnis is about to shake his fists heavenward he looks up and the night’s beauty strikes him dumb he falls to his knees sharp stones cut through his thin pajamas the shock sends a shiver over him he quivers tears mist his eyes he writhes

“god almighty dear god dear jesus do not torture me with beauty take it away give me an ugly world ha ugly stinking like unwashed niggers dear jesus do not chain me to myself and set these hills and valleys heaving with folksongs so close to me that i cannot reach them there is a radiant beauty in the night that touches and  tortures me ugh hell get up you damn fool look around whats beautiful there hog pens and chicken yards dirty red mud stinking outhouse whats beauty anyway but ugliness if it hurts you god he doesnt exist but nevertheless he is ugly hence what comes from him is ugly lynchers and business men and that cockroach hanby especially how come that he gets to be principal of a school of the school i’m driven to teach in god’s handiwork doubtless god and hanby they belong together two godam moralspouters oh no i wont let that emotion come up in me stay down stay down i tell you o jesus thou art beautiful come ralph pull yourself together curses and adoration dont come from what is sane this loneliness dumbness awful intangible oppression is enough to drive a man insane miles from nowhere a speck on a georgia hillside jesus can you imagine it—an atom of dust in agony on a hillside thats a spectacle for you come ralph old man pull yourself together”

kabnis has stiffened he is conscious now of the night wind and of how it chills him he rises he totters as a man would who for the first time uses artificial limbs as a completely artificial man would the large frame house squatting on brick pillars where the principal of the school his wife and the boarding girls sleep seems a curious shadow of his mind he tries but cannot convince himself of its reality his gaze drifts down into the vale across the swamp up over the solid dusk bank of pines and rests bewilderedlike on the courthouse tower it is dull silver in the moonlight white child that sleeps upon the top of pines kabnis’ mind clears he sees himself yanked beneath that tower he sees white minds with indolent assumption juggle justice and a nigger somewhere far off in the straight line of his sight is augusta christ how cut off from everything he is and hours hours north why not say a lifetime north washington sleeps its still peaceful streets how desirable they are its people whom he had always halfway despised new york impossible it was a fiction he had dreamed it an impotent nostalgia grips him it becomes intolerable he forces himself to narrow to a cabin silhouetted on a knoll about a mile away peace negroes within it are content they farm they sing they love they sleep kabnis wonders if perhaps they can feel him if perhaps he gives them bad dreams things are so immediate in georgia

thinking that now he can go to sleep he reenters his room he builds a fire in the open hearth the room dances to the tongues of flames and sings to the crackling and spurting of the logs wind comes up between the floor boards through the black cracks of the walls

kabnis cant sleep light a cigarette if that old bastard comes over here and smells smoke i’m done for hell of a note cant even smoke the stillness of it where they burn and hang men you cant smoke cant take a swig of licker what do they think this is anyway some sort of temperance school how did i ever land in such a hole ugh one might just as well be in his grave still as a grave jesus how still everything is does the world know how still it is people make noise they are afraid of silence of what lives and god of what dies in silence there must be many dead things moving in silence they come here to touch me i swear i feel their fingers come ralph pull yourself together what in hell was that only the rustle of leaves i guess you know ralph old man it wouldnt surprise me at all to see a ghost people dont think there are such things they rationalize their fear and call their cowardice science fine bunch they are damit that was a noise and not the wind either a chicken maybe hell chickens dont wander around this time of night what in hell is it

a scraping sound like a piece of wood dragging over the ground is coming near

“ha ha the ghosts down this way havent got any chains to rattle so they drag trees along with them thats a good one but no joke something is outside this house as sure as hell whatever it is it can get a good look at me and i cant see it jesus christ”

kabnis pours water on the flames and blows his lamp out he picks up a poker and stealthily approaches the outside door swings it open and lurches into the night a calf carrying a yoke of wood bolts away from him and scampers down the road

“well i’m damned this godam place is sure getting the best of me come ralph old man pull yourself together nights cant last forever thank god for that its sunday already first time in my life i’ve ever wanted sunday to come hell of a day and down here there’s no such thing as ducking church well i’ll see halsey and layman and get a good square meal thats something and halsey’s a damn good feller cant talk to him though who in christ’s world can i talk to a hen god myself i’m going bats no doubt of that come now ralph go in and make yourself go to sleep come now  in the door  thats right put the poker down there all right slip under the sheets close your eyes think nothing  a long time  nothing nothing dont even think nothing blank not even blank count no mustnt count nothing  blank  nothing  blank  space without stars in it no nothing  nothing

kabnis sleeps the winds like softvoiced vagrant poets sing

whiteman’s land
niggers sing
burn bear black children
till poor rivers bring
rest and sweet glory
in camp ground

the parlor of fred halsey’s home there is a seediness about it it seems as though the fittings have given a frugal service to at least seven generations of middleclass shopowners an open grate burns cheerily in contrast to the gray cold changed autumn weather an oldfashioned mantelpiece supports a family clock not running a figure or two in imitation bronze and two small group pictures directly above it in a heavy oak frame the portrait of a bearded man black hair thick and curly intensifies the pallor of the high forehead the eyes are daring the nose sharp and regular the poise suggests a tendency to adventure checked by the necessities of absolute command the portrait is that of an english gentleman who has retained much of his culture in that money has enabled him to escape being drawn through a landgrubbing pioneer life his nature and features modified by marriage and circumstances have been transmitted to his greatgrandson fred to the left of this picture spaced on the wall is a smaller portrait of the greatgrandmother that here there is a negro strain no one would doubt but it is difficult to say in precisely what feature it lies on close inspection her mouth is seen to be wistfully twisted the expression of her face seems to shift before one’s gaze—now ugly repulsive now sad and somehow beautiful in its pain a tin woodbox rests on the floor below to the right of the greatgrandfather’s portrait hangs a family group the father mother two brothers and one sister of fred it includes himself some thirty years ago when his face was an olive white and his hair luxuriant and dark and wavy the father is a rich brown the mother practically white of the children the girl quite young is like fred the two brothers darker the walls of the room are plastered and painted green an old upright piano is tucked into the corner near the window the window looks out169 on a forlorn boxlike whitewashed frame church negroes are gathering on foot driving questionable gray and brown mules and in an occasional ford for afternoon service beyond georgia hills roll off into the distance their dreary aspect heightened by the gray spots of unpainted one and tworoom shanties clumps of pine trees here and there are the dark points the whole landscape is approaching the church bell tolls above its squat tower a great spiral of buzzards reaches far into the heavens an ironic comment upon the path that leads into the christian land three rocking chairs are grouped around the grate sunday papers scattered on the floor indicate a recent usage halsey a wellbuilt stocky fellow hair cropped close enters the room his sunday clothes smell of wood and glue for it is his habit to potter around his wagonshop even on the lord’s day he is followed by professor layman tall heavy loosejointed georgia negro by turns teacher and preacher who has traveled in almost every nook and corner of the state and hence knows more than would be good for anyone other than a silent man kabnis trying to170 force through a gathering heaviness trails in behind them they slip into chairs before the fire

layman sholy fine mr halsey sholy fine this town’s right good at feedin folks better’n most towns in th state even for preachers but i ken say this beats um all yassur now aint that right professor kabnis

kabnis yes sir this beats them all all right—best i’ve had and thats a fact though my comparison doesnt carry far y’know

layman hows that professor

kabnis well this is my first time out—

layman for a fact aint seed you round so much whats th trouble dont like our folks down this away

halsey aint that layman he aint like most northern niggers that way aint a thing stuck up about him he likes us you an me maybe all—its that red mud over yonder—gets stuck in it an cant get out laughs an then he loves th fire so warm as its been coldest yankee i’ve ever seen but i’m goin t get him out now in a jiffy eh kabnis

kabnis sure i should say so sure dont think its because i dont like folks down this way just the opposite in fact theres more hospitality and everything its diff—that is theres lots of northern exaggeration about the south its not half the terror they picture it things are not half bad as one could easily figure out for himself without ever crossing the mason and dixie line all these people wouldnt stay down here especially the rich the ones that could easily leave if conditions were so mighty bad and then too sometime back my family were southerners y’know from georgia in fact—

layman nothin t feel proud about professor neither your folks nor mine

halsey in a mock religious tone amen t that brother layman amen turning to kabnis half playful yet somehow dead in earnest an mr kabnis kindly remember youre in th land of cotton—hell of a land th white folks get th boll th niggers get th stalk an dont you dare touch th boll or even look at it they’ll swing y sho laughs

kabnis but they wouldnt touch a gentleman—fellows men like us three here—

layman nigger’s a nigger down this away professor an only two dividins good an bad an even they aint permanent categories they sometimes mixes um up when it comes t lynchin i’ve seen um do it

halsey dont let th fear int y though kabnis this county’s a good un aint been a stringin up i can remember laughs

layman this is a good town an a good county but theres some that makes up fer it

kabnis things are better now though since that stir about those peonage cases arent they

layman ever hear tell of a single shot killin moren one rabbit professor

kabnis no of course not that is but then—

halsey now i know you werent born yesterday sprung up so rapid like you aint heard of th brick thrown in th hornets’ nest laughs

kabnis hardly hardly i know—

halsey course y do to layman see northern niggers aint as dumb as they make out t be

kabnis overlooking the remark just stirs them up to sting

halsey t perfection an put just like a professor should put it

kabnis thats what actually did happen

layman well if it aint sos only because th stingers already movin jes as fast as they ken go an been goin ever since i ken remember an then some mo though i dont usually make mention of it

halsey damn sight better not say layman you come from where theyre always swarmin dont y

layman yassur i do that sho dont want t mention it but its a fact i’ve seed th time when there werent no use t even stretch out flat upon th ground seen um shoot an cut a man t pieces who had died th night befo yassur an they didnt stop when they found out he was dead—jes went on ahackin at him anyway

kabnis what did you do what did you say to them professor

layman thems th things you neither does a thing or talks about if y want t stay around this away professor

halsey listen t what he’s tellin y kabnis may come in handy some day

kabnis cant something be done but of course not this preacherridden race pray and shout theyre in the preacher’s hands thats what it is and the preacher’s hands are in the white man’s pockets

halsey present company always excepted

kabnis the professor knows i wasnt referring to him

layman preacher’s a preacher anywheres you turn no use exceptin

kabnis well of course if you look at it that way i didnt mean— but cant something be done

layman sho yassur an done first rate an well jes like sam raymon done it

kabnis hows that what did he do

layman th white folks reckon i oughtnt tell it had jes knocked two others like you kill a cow—brained um with an ax when they caught sam raymon by a stream they was about t do fer him when he up an says “white folks i gotter die i knows that but wont y let me die in my own way” some was fer gettin after him but th boss held um back an says “jes so longs th nigger dies—” an sam fell down ont his knees an prayed “o lord ise comin to y” an he up an jumps int th stream

singing from the church becomes audible above it rising and falling in a plaintive moan a woman’s voice swells to shouting kabnis hears it his face gives way to an expression of mingled fear contempt and pity layman takes no notice of it halsey grins at kabnis he feels like having a little sport with him

halsey lets go t church eh kabnis

kabnis seeking control all right—no sir not by a damn sight once a days enough for me christ but that stuff gets to me meaning no reflection on you professor

halsey course not say kabnis noticed y this morning what’d y get up for an go out

kabnis couldnt stand the shouting and thats a fact we dont have that sort of thing up north we do but that is some one should see to it that they are stopped or put out when they get so bad the preacher has to stop his sermon for them

halsey is that th way youall sit on sisters up north

kabnis in the church i used to go to no one ever shouted—

halsey lungs weak

kabnis hardly that is—

halsey yankees are right up t th minute in tellin folk how t turn a trick they always were good at talkin

kabnis well anyway they should be stopped

layman thats right thats true an its th worst ones in th community that comes int th church t shout i’ve sort a made a study of it you take a man what drinks th biggest lickerhead around will come int th church an yell th loudest an th sister whats done wrong an is always doin wrong will sit down in th amen corner an swing her arms an shout her head off seems as if they cant control themselves out in th world they cant control themselves in church now dont that sound logical professor

halsey reckon its as good as any but i heard that queer cuss over yonder—y know him dont y kabnis well y ought t he had a runin with your boss th other day—same as you’ll have if you dont walk th chalkline an th quicker th better i hate that hanby ornery bastard i’ll mash his mouth in one of these days well as i was sayin that feller lewis’s name i heard him sayin somethin about a stream whats dammed has got t cut loose somewheres an that sounds good i know th feelin myself he strikes me as knowin a bucketful bout most things that feller does seems like he doesnt want t talk an does sometimes like layman here damn queer feller him

layman cant make heads or tails of him an i’ve seen lots o queer possums in my day everybody’s wonderin about him white folks too he’ll have t leave here soon thats sho always askin questions an i aint seed his lips move once pokin round an notin somethin noted what i said th other day an that werent fer notin down

kabnis what was that

layman oh a lynchin that took place bout a year ago th worst i know of round these parts

halsey bill burnam

layman na mame lamkins

halsey grunts but says nothing

the preacher’s voice rolls from the church in an insistent chanting monotone at regular intervals it rises to a crescendo note the sister begins to shout her voice highpitched and hysterical is almost perfectly attuned to the nervous key of kabnis halsey notices his distress and is amused by it layman’s face is expressionless kabnis wants to hear the story of mame lamkins he does not want to hear it it can be no worse than the shouting

kabnis his chair rocking faster what about mame lamkins

halsey tell him layman

the preacher momentarily stops the choir together with the entire congregation sings an old spiritual the music seems to quiet the shouter her heavy breathing has the sound of evening winds that blow through pinecones layman’s voice is uniformly low and soothing a canebrake murmuring the tale to its neighborroad would be more passionate

layman white folks know that niggers talk an they dont mind jes so long as nothing comes of it so here goes she was in th familyway mame lamkins was they killed her in th street an some white man seein th risin in her stomach as she lay there soppy in her blood like any cow took an ripped her belly open an th kid fell out it was living but a nigger baby aint supposed t live so he jabbed his knife in it an stuck it t a tree an then they all went away

kabnis christ no what had she done

layman tried t hide her husband when they was after him

a shriek pierces the room the bronze pieces on the mantel hum the sister cries frantically “jesus jesus i’ve found jesus o lord glory t god one mo sinner is acomin home” at the height of this a stone wrapped round with paper crashes through the window kabnis springs to his feet terrorstricken layman is worried halsey picks up the stone takes off the wrapper smooths it out and reads “you northern nigger its time fer y t leave git along now” kabnis knows that the command is meant for him fear squeezes him caves him in as a violent external pressure would fear flows inside him it fills him up he bloats he saves himself from bursting by dashing wildly from the room halsey and layman stare stupidly at each other the stone the crumpled paper are things huge things that weight them their thoughts are vaguely concerned with the texture of the stone with the color of the paper then they remember the words and begin to shift them about in sentences layman even construes them grammatically suddenly the sense of them comes back to halsey he grips layman by the arm and they both follow after kabnis

a false dusk has come early the countryside is ashen chill cabins and roads and canebrakes whisper the church choir dipping into a long silence sings

my lord what a mourning
my lord what a mourning
my lord what a mourning
when the stars begin to fall
softly luminous over the hills and valleys the faint spray of a scattered star

a splotchy figure drives forward along the cane and cornstalk hemmedin road a scarecrow replica of kabnis awkwardly animate fantastically plastered with red georgia mud it skirts the big house whose windows shine like mellow lanterns in the dusk its shoulder jogs against a sweetgum tree the figure caroms off against the cabin door and lunges in it slams the door as if to prevent some one entering after it

“god almighty theyre here after me on me all along the road i saw their eyes flaring from the cane hounds shouts what in god’s name did i run here for a mudhole trap i stumbled on a rope o god a rope their clammy hands were like the love of death playing up and down my spine trying to trip my legs to trip my spine up and down my spine my spine my legs why in hell didn’t they catch me”

kabnis wheels around half defiant half numbed with a more immediate fear

“wanted to trap me here get out o there i see you”

he grabs a broom from beside the chimney and violently pokes it under the bed the broom strikes a tin washtub the noise bewilders he recovers

“not there in the closet”

he throws the broom aside and grips the poker starts towards the closet door towards somewhere in the perfect blackness behind the chimney

“i’ll brain you”

he stops short the barks of hounds evidently in pursuit reach him a voice liquid in distance yells “hi hi”

“o god theyre after me holy father mother of christ—hell this aint no time for prayer—”

voices just outside the door

“reckon he’s here”

“dont see no light though”

the door is flung open

kabnis get back or i’ll kill you

he braces himself brandishing the poker

halsey coming in aint as bad as all that put that thing down

layman its only us professor nobody else after y

kabnis halsey layman close that door dont light that light for godsake get away from there

halsey nobody’s after y kabnis i’m tellin y put that thing down an get yourself together

kabnis i tell you they are i saw them i heard the hounds

halsey these aint th days of hounds an uncle tom’s cabin feller white folks aint in fer all them theatrics these days theys more direct than that if what they wanted was t get y theyd have just marched right in an took y where y sat somebodys down by th branch chasin rabbits an atreein possums

a shot is heard

halsey got him i reckon saw tom goin out with his gun tom’s pretty lucky most times

he goes to the bureau and lights the lamp the circular fringe is patterned on the ceiling the moving shadows of the men are huge against the bare wall boards halsey walks up to kabnis takes the poker from his grip and without more ado pushes him into a chair before the dark hearth

halsey youre a mess here layman get some trash an start a fire

layman fumbles around finds some newspapers and old bags puts them in the hearth arranges the wood and kindles the fire halsey sets a black iron kettle where it soon will be boiling then takes from his hippocket a bottle of corn licker which he passes to kabnis

halsey here this’ll straighten y out a bit

kabnis nervously draws the cork and gulps the licker down

kabnis ha good stuff thanks thank y halsey

halsey good stuff youre damn right hanby there dont think so wonder he doesnt come over t find out whos burnin his oil miserly bastard him th boys what made this stuff—are y listenin t me kabnis th boys what made this stuff have got th art down like i heard you say youd like t be with words eh have some layman

layman dont think i care for none thank y jes th same mr halsey

halsey care hell course y care everybody cares around these parts preachers an school teachers an everybody here here take it dont try that line on me

layman limbers up a little but he cannot quite forget that he is on school ground

layman thats right thats true sho shinin is th only business what pays in these hard times

he takes a nip and passes the bottle to kabnis kabnis is in the middle of a long swig when a rap sounds on the door he almost spills the bottle but manages to pass it to halsey just as the door swings open and hanby enters he is a welldressed smooth rich blackskinned negro who thinks there is no one quite so suave and polished as himself to members of his own race he affects the manners of a wealthy white planter or when he is up north he lets it be known that his ideas are those of the best new england tradition to white men he bows without ever completely humbling himself tradesmen in the town tolerate him because he spends his money with them he delivers his words with a full consciousness of his moral superiority

hanby hum erer professor kabnis to come straight to the point the progress of the negro race is jeopardized whenever the personal habits and examples set by its guides and mentors fall below the acknowledged and hardwon standard of its average member this institution of which i am the humble president was founded and has been maintained at a cost of great labor and untold sacrifice its purpose is to teach our youth to live better cleaner more noble lives to prove to the world that the negro race can be just like any other race it hopes to attain this aim partly by the salutary examples set by its instructors i cannot hinder the progress of a race simply to indulge a single member i have thought the matter out beforehand i can assure you therefore if i find your resignation on my desk by tomorrow morning mr kabnis i shall not feel obliged to call in the sheriff otherwise”

kabnis a fellow can take a drink in his own room if he wants to in the privacy of his own room

hanby his room but not the institution’s room mr kabnis

kabnis this is my room while i’m in it

hanby mr clayborn the sheriff can inform you as to that

kabnis oh well what do i care—glad to get out of this mudhole

hanby i should think so from your looks

kabnis you neednt get sarcastic about it

hanby no that is true and i neednt wait for your resignation either mr kabnis

kabnis oh you’ll get that all right dont worry

hanby and i should like to have the room thoroughly aired and cleaned and ready for your successor by tomorrow noon professor

kabnis trying to rise you can have your godam room right away i dont want it

hanby but i wont have your cursing

halsey pushes kabnis back into his chair

halsey sit down kabnis till i wash y

hanby to halsey i would rather not have drinking men on the premises mr halsey you will oblige me—

halsey i’ll oblige you by stayin right on this spot this spot get me till i get damned ready t leave

he approaches hanby hanby retreats but manages to hold his dignity

halsey let me get you told right now mr samuel hanby now listen t me i aint no slick an span slave youve hired an dont y think it for a minute youve bullied enough about this town an besides wheres that bill youve been owin me listen t me if i dont get it paid in by tmorrer noon mr hanby he mockingly assumes hanby’s tone and manner i shall feel obliged t call th sheriff an that sheriff’ll be myself who’ll catch y in th road an pull y out your buggy an rightly attend t y you heard me now leave him alone i’m takin him home with me i got it fixed before you came in he’s goin t work with me shapin shafts and buildin wagons’ll make a man of him what nobody y get me what nobody can take advantage of thats all

halsey burrs off into vague and incoherent comment

pause disagreeable

layman’s eyes are glazed on the spurting fire

kabnis wants to rise and put both halsey and hanby in their places he vaguely knows that he must do this else the power of direction will completely slip from him to those outside the conviction is just strong enough to torture him to bring a feverish quickpassing flare into his eyes to mutter words soggy in hot saliva to jerk his arms upward in futile protest halsey noticing his gestures thinks it is water that he desires he brings a glass to him kabnis slings it to the floor heat of the conviction dies his arms crumple his upper lip his mustache quiver rap rap on the door the sounds slap kabnis they bring a hectic color to his cheeks like huge cold finger tips they touch his skin and gooseflesh it hanby strikes a commanding pose he moves toward layman layman’s face is innocently immobile

halsey whos there

voice lewis

halsey come in lewis come on in

lewis enters he is the queer fellow who has been referred to a tall wiry coppercolored man thirty perhaps his mouth and eyes suggest purpose guided by an adequate intelligence he is what a stronger kabnis might have been and in an odd faint way resembles him as he steps towards the others he seems to be issuing sharply from a vivid dream lewis shakes hands with halsey nods perfunctorily to hanby who has stiffened to meet him smiles rapidly at layman and settles with real interest on kabnis

lewis kabnis passed me on the road had a piece of business of my own and couldnt get here any sooner thought i might be able to help in some way or other

halsey a good baths bout all he needs now an somethin t put his mind t rest

lewis i think i can give him that that note was meant for me some negroes have grown uncomfortable at my being here—

kabnis you mean mr lewis some colored folks threw it christ amighty

halsey thats what he means an just as i told y white folks more direct than that

kabnis what are they after you for

lewis its a long story kabnis too long for now and it might involve present company he laughs pleasantly and gestures vaguely in the direction of hanby tell you about it later on perhaps

kabnis youre not going

lewis i’m on a sort of contract with myself is about to leave well glad its nothing serious—

lewis i see

his eyes turn to kabnis in the instant of their shifting a vision of the life they are to meet kabnis a promise of a soilsoaked beauty uprooted thinning out suspended a few feet above the soil whose touch would resurrect him arm’s length removed from him whose will to help there is a swift intuitive interchange of consciousness kabnis has a sudden need to rush into the arms of this man his eyes call “brother” and then a savage cynical twistabout within him mocks his impulse and strengthens him to repulse lewis his lips curl cruelly his eyes laugh they are glittering needles stitching with a throbbing ache they draw lewis to lewis brusquely wheels on hanby

lewis i’d like to see you sir a moment if you dont mind

hanby’s tight collar and vest effectively preserve him

hanby yes erer mr lewis right away

lewis see you later halsey

halsey so long—thanks—sho hope so lewis

as he opens the door and hanby passes out a woman miles down the valley begins to sing her song is a spark that travels swiftly to the nearby cabins like purple tallow flames songs jet up they spread a ruddy haze over the heavens the haze swings low now the whole countryside is a soft chorus lord o lord lewis closes the door behind him a flame jets out

the kettle is boiling halsey notices it he pulls the washtub from beneath the bed he arranges for the bath before the fire

halsey told y them theatrics didnt fit a white man th niggers just like i told y an after him aint surprisin though he aint bowed t none of them nassur t nairy a one of them nairy an inch nairy a time an only mixed when he was good an ready—

he bustles and fusses about kabnis as if he were a child kabnis submits wearily he has no will to resist him

a month has passed

halsey’s workshop it is an old building just off the main street of sempter the walls to within a few feet of the ground are of an ageworn cement mixture on the outside they are considerably crumbled and peppered with what looks like musketshot inside the plaster has fallen away in great chunks leaving the laths grayed and cobwebbed exposed a sort of loft above the shop proper serves as a breakwater for the rain and sunshine which otherwise would have free entry to the main floor the shop is filled with old wheels and parts of wheels broken shafts and wooden litter a double door midway the street wall to the left of this a workbench that holds a vise and a variety of woodwork tools a window with as many panes broken as whole throws light on the bench opposite in the rear wall a second window looks out upon the back yard in the left wall a rickety smokeblackened chimney and hearth with fire blazing smoothworn chairs grouped about the hearth suggest the village meetingplace several large wooden blocks chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the middle of the floor they are the supports used in almost any sort of wagonwork their idleness means that halsey has no worthwhile job on foot to the right of the central door is a junk heap and directly behind this stairs that lead down into the cellar the cellar is known as “the hole” besides being the home of a very old man it is used by halsey on those occasions when he spices up the life of the small town

halsey wonderfully himself in his work overalls stands in the doorway and gazes up the street expectantly then his eyes grow listless he slouches against the smoothrubbed frame he lights a cigarette shifts his position braces an arm against the door kabnis passes the window and stoops to get in under halsey’s arm he is awkward and ludicrous like a schoolboy in his big brother’s new overalls he skirts the large blocks on the floor and drops into a chair before the fire halsey saunters towards him

kabnis time f lunch

halsey ya

he stands by the hearth rocking backward and forward he stretches his hands out to the fire he washes them in the warm glow of the flames they never get cold but he warms them

kabnis saw lewis up th street said he’d be down

halsey’s eyes brighten he looks at kabnis turns away says nothing kabnis fidgets twists his thin blue clothcovered limbs pulls closer to the fire till the heat stings his shins pushes back pokes the burned logs puts on several fresh ones fidgets the town bell strikes twelve

kabnis fix it up f tnight

halsey leave it t me

kabnis get lewis in

halsey tryin t

the air is heavy with the smell of pine and resin green logs spurt and sizzle sap trickles from an old pineknot into the flames layman enters he carries a lunchpail kabnis for the moment thinks that he is a day laborer

layman evenin gen’lemun

both whats say layman

layman squares a chair to the fire and droops into it several town fellows silent unfathomable men for the most part saunter in overalls thick tan shoes felt hats marvelously shaped and twisted one asks halsey for a cigarette he gets it the blacksmith a tremendous black man comes in from the forge not even a nod from him he picks up an axle and goes out lewis enters the town men look curiously at him suspicion and an open liking contest for possession of their faces they are uncomfortable one by one they drift into the street

layman heard y was leavin mr lewis

kabnis months up eh hell of a month i’ve got

halsey sorry y goin lewis just getting acquainted like

lewis sorry myself halsey in a way—

layman gettin t like our town mr lewis

lewis i’m afraid its on a different basis professor

layman thats right thats right sho

halsey a feller dropped in here tother day an said he knew what you was about said you had queer opinions well i could have told him you was a queer one myself but not th way he was driftin didnt mean anything by it but just let drop he thought you was a little wrong up here—crazy y’know laughs

kabnis y mean old blodson hell he’s bats himself

lewis i remember him we had a talk but what he found queer i think was not my opinions but my lack of them in half an hour he had settled everything boll weevils god the world war weevils and wars are the pests that god sends against the sinful people are too weak to correct themselves the redeemer is coming back get ready ye sinners for the advent of our lord interesting eh kabnis but not exactly what we want

halsey y could have come t me i’ve sho been after y enough most every time i’ve seen y

kabnis sarcastically hows it y never came t us professors

kabnis y mean t say y got somethin from that celluloidcollarerasercleaned old codger over in th mud hole

halsey rough on th old boy aint he laughs

lewis something yes layman here could have given me quite a deal but the incentive to his keeping quiet is so much greater than anything i could have offered him to open up that i crossed him off my mind and you—

kabnis what about me

halsey tell him lewis for godsake tell him i’ve told him but its somethin else he wants so bad i’ve heard him downstairs mumblin with th old man

lewis the old man

kabnis what about me come on now you know so much

halsey tell him lewis tell it t him

lewis life has already told him more than he is capable of knowing it has given him in excess of what he can receive i have been offered stuff in his stomach curdled and he vomited me

kabnis’ face twitches his body writhes

kabnis you know a lot you do how about halsey

a shriveled bony white man passes the window and enters the shop he carries a broken hatchethandle and the severed head he speaks with a flat drawn voice to halsey who comes forward to meet him

mr ramsay can y fix this fer me halsey

halsey looking it over reckon so mr ramsay here kabnis a little practice fer y

halsey directs kabnis showing him how to place the handle in the vise and cut it down the knife hangs kabnis thinks that it must be dull he jerks it hard the tool goes deep and shaves too much off mr ramsay smiles brokenly at him

mr ramsay to halsey still breakin in the new hand eh halsey seems like a likely enough faller once he gets th hang of it

he gives a tight laugh at his own good humor kabnis burns red the back of his neck stings him beneath his collar he feels stifled through ramsay the whole white south weighs down upon him the pressure is terrific he sweats under the arms chill beads run down his body his brows concentrate upon the handle as though his own life was staked upon the perfect shaving of it he begins to out and out botch the job halsey smiles

halsey he’ll make a good un some of these days mr ramsay

mr ramsay y ought t know yer daddy was a good un before y runs in th family seems like t me

halsey thats right mr ramsay

kabnis is hopeless halsey takes the handle from him with a few deft strokes he shaves it fits it gives it to ramsay

mr ramsay how much on this

halsey no charge mr ramsay

mr ramsay going out all right halsey come down an take it out in trade shoestrings or something

halsey yassur mr ramsay

halsey rejoins lewis and layman kabnis hangdogfashion follows him

halsey they like y if y work fer them

layman thats right mr halsey thats right sho

the group is about to resume its talk when hanby enters he is all energy bustle and business he goes direct to kabnis

hanby an axle is out in the buggy which i would like to have shaped into a crowbar you will see that it is fixed for me

without waiting for an answer and knowing that kabnis will follow he passes out kabnis scowling silent trudges after him

hanby from the outside have that ready for me by three o’clock young man i shall call for it

kabnis under his breath as he comes in th hell you say you old black swampgut

he slings the axle on the floor

halsey wheeee

layman lunch finished long ago rises heavily he shakes hands with lewis

layman might not see y again befo y leave mr lewis i enjoys t hear y talk y might have been a preacher maybe a bishop some day sho do hope t see y back this away again sometime mr lewis

lewis thanks professor hope i’ll see you

layman waves a long arm loosely to the others and leaves kabnis goes to the door his eyes sullen gaze up the street

kabnis carrie k’s comin with th lunch bout time

she passes the window her red girl’scap catching the sun flashes vividly with a stiff awkward little movement she crosses the doorsill and gives kabnis one of the two baskets which she is carrying there is a slight stoop to her shoulders the curves of her body blend with this to a soft rounded charm her gestures are stiffly variant black bangs curl over the forehead of her ovalolive face her expression is dazed but on provocation it can melt into a wistful smile adolescent she is easily the sister of fred halsey

carrie k mother says excuse her brother fred an ralph fer bein late

kabnis everythings all right an ok carrie kate ok an all right

the two men settle on their lunch carrie with hardly a glance in the direction of the hearth as is her habit is about to take the second basket down to the old man when lewis rises in doing so he draws her unwitting attention their meeting is a swift sunburst lewis impulsively moves towards her his mind flashes images of her life in the southern town he sees the nascent woman her flesh already stiffening to cartilage drying to bone her spiritbloom even now touched sullen bitter her rich beauty fading he wants to— he stretches forth his hands to hers he takes them they feel like warm cheeks against his palms the sunburst from her eyes floods up and haloes him christeyes his eyes look to her fearlessly she loves into them and then something happens her face blanches awkwardly she draws away the sinbogies of respectable southern colored folks clamor at her “look out be a good girl a good girl look out” she gropes for her basket that has fallen to the floor finds it and marches with a rigid gravity to her task of feeding the old man like the glowing white ash of burned paper lewis’ eyelids wavering settle down he stirs in the direction of the rear window from the back yard mules tethered to odd trees and posts blink dumbly at him they too seem burdened with an impotent pain kabnis and halsey are still busy with their lunch they havent noticed him after a while he turns to them

lewis your sister halsey whats to become of her what are you going to do for her

halsey who what what am i goin t do

lewis what i mean is what does she do down there

halsey oh feeds th old man had lunch lewis

lewis thanks yes you have never felt her have you halsey well no i guess not i dont suppose you can nor can she old man halsey some one lives down there i’ve never heard of him tell me—

kabnis takes time from his meal to answer with some emphasis

kabnis theres lots of things you aint heard of

lewis dare say i’d like to see him

kabnis you’ll get all th chance you want tnight

halsey fixin a little somethin up fer tnight lewis th three of us an some girls come round bout tenthirty

lewis glad to but what under the sun does he do down there

halsey ask kabnis he blows off t him every chance he gets

kabnis gives a grunting laugh his mouth twists carrie returns from the cellar avoiding lewis she speaks to her brother

carrie k brother fred father hasnt eaten now goin on th second week but mumbles an talks funny or tries t talk when i put his hands ont th food he frightens me an i dunno what t do an oh i came near fergettin brother but mr marmon—he was eatin lunch when i saw him—told me t tell y that th lumber wagon busted down an he wanted y t fix it fer him said he reckoned he could get it t y after he ate

halsey chucks a halfeaten sandwich in the fire gets up arranges his blocks goes to the door and looks anxiously up the street the wind whirls a small spiral in the gray dust road

halsey why didnt y tell me sooner little sister

carrie k i fergot t an just remembered it now brother

her soft rolled words are fresh pain to lewis he wants to take her north with him what for he wonders what kabnis could do for her what she could do for him mother him carrie gathers the lunch things silently and in her pinched manner curtsies and departs kabnis lights his afterlunch cigarette lewis who has sensed a change becomes aware that he is not included in it he starts to ask again about the old man decides not to rises to go

lewis think i’ll run along halsey

halsey sure glad t see y any time

kabnis dont forget tnight

lewis dont worry i wont so long

kabnis so long we’ll be expectin y

lewis passes halsey at the door halsey’s cheeks form a vacant smile his eyes are wide awake watching for the wagon to turn from broad street into his road

halsey so long

his words reach lewis halfway to the corner

night soft belly of a pregnant negress throbs evenly against the torso of the south night throbs a wombsong to the south cane and cottonfields pine forests cypress swamps sawmills and factories are fecund at her touch night’s wombsong sets them singing night winds are the breathing of the unborn child whose calm throbbing in the belly of a negress sets them somnolently singing hear their song

whiteman’s land
niggers sing
burn bear black children
till poor rivers bring
rest and sweet glory
in camp ground

sempter’s streets are vacant and still white paint on the wealthier houses has the chill blue glitter of distant stars negro cabins are a purple blur broad street is deserted winds stir beneath the corrugated iron canopies and dangle odd bits of rope tied to horse and mulegnawed hitchingposts one store window has a light in it chesterfield cigarette and cherocola cardboard advertisements are stacked in it from a side door two men come out pause for a last word and then say good night soon they melt in shadows thicker than they way off down the street four figures sway beneath iron awnings which form a sort of corridor that imperfectly echoes and jumbles what they say a fifth form joins them they turn into the road that leads to halsey’s workshop the old building is phosphorescent above deep shade the figures pass through the double door night winds whisper in the eaves sing weirdly in the ceiling cracks stir curls of shavings on the floor halsey lights a candle a goodsized lumber wagon wheels off rests upon the blocks kabnis makes a face at it an unearthly hush is upon the place no one seems to want to talk to move lest the scraping of their feet

halsey come on down this way folks

he leads the way stella follows and close after her cora lewis and kabnis they descend into the hole it seems huge limitless in the candle light the walls are of stone wonderfully fitted they have no openings save a small ironbarred window toward the top of each they are dry and warm the ground slopes away to the rear of the building and thus leaves the south wall exposed to the sun the blacksmith’s shop is plumb against the right wall the floor is clay shavings have at odd times been matted into it in the righthand corner under the stairs two goodsized pine mattresses resting on cardboard are on either side of a wooden table on this are several halfburned candles and an oil lamp behind the table an irregular piece of mirror hangs on the wall a loose something that looks to be a gaudy ball costume dangles from a nearby hook to the front a second table holds a lamp and several whiskey glasses six rickety chairs are near this table two old wagon wheels rest on the floor to the left sitting in a highbacked chair which stands upon a low platform the old man he is like a bust in black walnut graybearded grayhaired prophetic immobile lewis’ eyes are sunk in him the others unconcerned are about to pass on to the front table when lewis grips halsey and so turns him that the candle flame shines obliquely on the old man’s features

lewis and he rules over—

kabnis th smoke an fire of th forge

lewis black vulcan i wouldnt say so that forehead great woolly beard those eyes a mute john the baptist of a new religion—or a tonguetied shadow of an old

kabnis his tongue is tied all right an i can vouch f that

lewis has he never talked to you

halsey kabnis wont give him a chance

he laughs the girls laugh kabnis winces

lewis what do you call him

halsey father

lewis good father what

kabnis father of hell

halsey father’s th only name we have fer him come on lets sit down an get t th pleasure of the evenin

lewis father john it is from now on

slave boy whom some christian mistress taught to read the bible black man who saw jesus in the ricefields and began preaching to his people moses and christwords used for songs dead blind father of a muted folk who feel their way upward to a life that crushes or absorbs them speak father suppose your eyes could see old man the years hold hands o sing suppose your lips

halsey does he never talk

halsey na but sometimes only seldom mumbles sis says he talks—

kabnis i’ve heard him talk

halsey first i’ve ever heard of it you dont give him a chance sis says she’s made out several words mostly one—an like as not cause it was “sin”

kabnis all those old fogies stutter about sin

cora laughs in a loose sort of way she is a tall thin mulatto woman her eyes are deepset behind a pointed nose her hair is coarse and bushy seeing that stella also is restless she takes her arm and the two women move towards the table they slip into chairs halsey follows and lights the lamp he lays out a pack of cards stella sorts them as if telling fortunes she is a beautifully proportioned largeeyed brownskin girl except for the twisted line of her mouth when she smiles or laughs there is about her no suggestion of the life she’s been through kabnis with great mocksolemnity goes to the corner takes down the robe and dons it he is a curious spectacle acting a part yet very real he joins the others at the table they are used to him lewis is surprised he laughs kabnis shrinks and then glares at him with a furtive hatred halsey bringing out a bottle of corn licker pours drinks

halsey come on lewis come on you fellers heres lookin at y

then as if suddenly recalling something he jerks away from the table and starts towards the steps

kabnis where y goin halsey

halsey where where y think that oak beam in th wagon—

kabnis come ere come ere sit down what in hell’s wrong with you fellers you with your wagon lewis with his father john this aint th time fer foolin with wagons daytime’s bad enough f that ere sit down ere lewis you too sit down have a drink thats right drink corn licker love th girls an listen t th old man mumblin sin

there seems to be no goodtime spirit to the party something in the air is too tense and deep for that lewis seated now so that his eyes rest upon the old man merges with his source and lets the pain and beauty of the south meet him there white faces painpollen settle downward through a canesweet mist and touch the215 ovaries of yellow flowers cottonbolls bloom droop black roots twist in a parched red soil beneath a blazing sky magnolias fragrant a trifle futile lovely far off his eyelids close a force begins to heave and rise stella is serious reminiscent

stella usall is brought up t hate sin worse than death—

kabnis an then before you have y eyes half open youre made t love it if y want t live

stella us never—

kabnis oh i know your story that old prim bastard over yonder an then old calvert’s office—

stella it wasnt them—

kabnis i know they put y out of church an then i guess th preacher came around an asked f some but thats your body now me—

halsey passing him the bottle all right kid we believe y here take another wheres clover stel

stella you know how jim is when he’s just out th swamp done up in shine an wouldnt let her come said he’d bust her head open if she went out

kabnis dont see why he doesnt stay over with laura where he belongs

stella ask him an i reckon he’ll tell y more than you want

halsey th nigger hates th sight of a black woman worse than death sorry t mix y up this way lewis but y see how tis

lewis’ skin is tight and glowing over the fine bones of his face his lips tremble his nostrils quiver the others notice this and smile knowingly at each other drinks and smokes are passed around they pay no neverminds to him a real party is being worked up then lewis opens his eyes and looks at them their smiles disperse in hotcold tremors kabnis chokes his laugh it sputters gurgles his eyes flicker and turn away he tries to pass the thing off by taking a long drink which he makes considerable fuss over he is drawn back to lewis seeing lewis’ gaze still upon him he scowls

kabnis whatsha lookin at me for y want t know who i am well i’m ralph kabnis—lot of good its goin t do y well whatsha keep lookin for i’m ralph kabnis aint that enough f y want th whole family history its none of your godam business anyway keep off me do y hear keep off me look at cora aint she pretty enough t look at look at halsey or stella clover ought t be here an you could look at her an love her thats what you need i know—

lewis ralph kabnis gets satisfied that way

kabnis satisfied say quit your kiddin here look at that old man there see him he’s satisfied do i look like him when i’m dead i dont expect t be satisfied is that enough f y with your godam nosin or do you want more well y wont get it understand

lewis the old man as symbol flesh and spirit of the past what do think he would say if he could see you you look at him kabnis

kabnis just like any doneup preacher is what he looks t me jam some false teeth in his mouth and crank him an youd have god almighty spit in torrents all around th floor oh hell an he reminds me of that black cockroach over yonder an besides he aint my past my ancestors were southern bluebloods—

lewis and black

kabnis aint much difference between blue an black

lewis enough to draw a denial from you cant hold them can you master slave soil and the overarching heavens dusk dawn they fight and bastardize you the sun tint of your cheeks flame of the great season’s multicolored leaves tarnished burned split shredded easily burned no use

his gaze shifts to stella stella’s face draws back her breasts come towards him

stella i aint got nothin f y mister taint no use t look at me

halsey youre a queer feller lewis i swear y are told y so didnt i girls just take him easy though an he’ll be ridin just th same as any georgia mule eh lewis laughs

stella i’m goin t tell y somethin mister it aint t you t th mister lewis what noses about its t somethin different i dunno what that old man there—maybe its him—is like m father used t look he used t sing an when he could sing no mo they’d allus come f him an carry him t church an there he’d sit befo th pulpit aswayin219 an aleadin every song a white man took m mother an it broke th old man’s heart he died an then i didnt care what become of me an i dont now i dont care now dont get it in y head i’m some sentimental susie askin for yo sop nassur but theres somethin t yo th others aint got boars an kids an fools—thats all i’ve known boars when their fever’s up when their fever’s up they come t me halsey asks me over when he’s off th job kabnis—it ud be a sin t play with him he takes it out in talk

halsey knows that he has trifled with her at odd things he has been inwardly penitent before her tasking him but now he wants to hurt her he turns to lewis

halsey lewis i got a little licker in me an thats true true’s what i said true but th stuff just seems t wake me up an make my mind a man of me listen you know a lot queer as hell as y are an i want t ask y some questions theyre too high fer them stella an cora an kabnis so we’ll just excuse em a chat between ourselves turns to the others youall cant listen in on this twont interest y so just leave th table t this gen’lemun an myself go long now

kabnis gets up pompous in his robe grotesquely so and makes as if to go through a grand march with stella she shoves him off roughly and in a mood swings her body to the steps kabnis grabs cora and parades around passing the old man to whom he bows in mockcurtsy he sweeps by the table snatches the licker bottle and then he and cora sprawl on the mattresses she meets his weak approaches after the manner she thinks stella would use

halsey contemptuously watches them until he is sure that they are settled

halsey this aint th sort o thing f me lewis when i got work upstairs nassur you an me has got things t do wastin time on common lowdown women—say lewis look at her now—stella—aint she a picture common wench—na she aint lewis you know she aint i’m only tryin t fool y i used t love that girl yassur an sometimes when th moon is thick an i hear dogs up th valley barkin an some old woman fetches out her song an th winds seem like th lord made them fer t fetch an carry th smell o pine an cane an there aint no big job on foot i sometimes get t thinkin that i still do but i want t talk t y lewis queer as y are y know lewis i went t school once ya in augusta but it wasnt a regular school na it was a pussy sundayschool masqueradin under a regular name some goodygoody teachers from th north had come down t teach th niggers if you was nearly white they liked y if you was black they didnt but it wasnt that—i was all right y see i couldnt stand em messin an pawin over m business like i was a child so i cussed em out an left kabnis there ought t have cussed out th old duck over yonder an left he’d a been a better man tday but as i was sayin i couldnt stand their ways so i left an came here an worked with my father an been here ever since he died i set in f myself an its always been give me a good job an sure pay an i aint far from being satisfied so far as satisfaction goes prejudice is everywheres about this country an a nigger aint in much standin anywheres but when it comes t pottin round an doin nothing with nothin bigger’n an axhandle t hold a feller down like it was a while back befo i got this job—that beam ought t be—but tmorrow mornin early’s time enough f that as i was sayin i gets t thinkin play dumb naturally t white folks i gets t thinkin i used to subscribe t th literary digest an that helped along a bit but there werent nothing i could sink m teeth int theres lots i want t ask y lewis been askin y t come around couldnt get y cant get in much tnight he glances at the others his mind fastens on kabnis say tell me this whats on your mind t say on that feller there kabnis’ name one queer bird ought t know another seems like t me

licker has released conflicts in kabnis and set them flowing he pricks his ears intuitively feels that the talk is about him leaves cora and approaches the table his eyes are watery heavy with passion he stoops he is a ridiculous pathetic figure in his showy robe

kabnis talkin bout me i know i’m th topic of conversation everywhere theres talk about this town girls an fellers white folks as well an if its me youre talkin bout guess i got a right t listen in whats sayin whats sayin bout his royal guts the duke whats sayin eh

halsey thats right old man there there here so much exertion merits a fittin reward help him t be seated cora

halsey gives him a swig of shine cora glides up seats him and then plumps herself down on his lap squeezing his head into her breasts kabnis mutters tries to break loose curses cora almost stifles him he goes limp and gives up cora toys with him ruffles his hair braids it parts it in the middle stella smiles contemptuously and then a sudden anger sweeps her she would like to lash cora from the place she’d like to take kabnis to some distant pine grove and nurse and mother him her eyes flash a quick tensioning throws her breasts and neck into a poised strain she starts towards them halsey grabs her arm and pulls her to him she struggles halsey pins her arms and kisses her she settles spurting like a pineknot afire

lewis finds himself completely cut out the glowing within him subsides it is followed by a dead chill kabnis carrie stella halsey cora the old man the cellar and the workshop the southern town descend upon him their pain is too intense he cannot stand it he bolts from the table leaps up the stairs plunges through the workshop and out into the night

6

the cellar swims in a pale phosphorescence the table the chairs the figure of the old man are amœbalike shadows which move about and float in it in the corner under the steps close to the floor a solid blackness a sound comes from it a forcible yawn part of the blackness detaches itself so that it may be seen against the grayness of the wall it moves forward and then seems to be clothing itself in odd dangling bits of shadow the voice of halsey vibrant and deepened calls

halsey kabnis cora stella

he gets no response he wants to get them up to get on the job he is intolerant of their sleepiness

halsey kabnis stella cora

gutturals jerky and impeded tell that he is shaking them

halsey come now up with you

kabnis sleepily and still more or less intoxicated whats th big idea what in hell—

halsey work but never you mind about that up with you

he mounts the steps to the workshop and starts a fire in the hearth in the yard he finds some chunks of coal which he brings in and throws on the fire he puts a kettle on to boil the wagon draws him he lifts an oakbeam fingers it and becomes abstracted then comes to himself and places the beam upon the workbench he looks over some newly cut wooden spokes he goes to the fire and pokes it the coals are redhot with a pair of long prongs he picks them up and places them in a thick iron bucket this he carries downstairs outside darkness has given way to the impalpable grayness of dawn this early morning light seeping through the four barred cellar windows is the color of the stony walls it seems to be an emanation from them halsey’s coals throw out a rich warm glow he sets them on the floor a safe distance from the beds

halsey no foolin now come up with you

other than a soft rustling there is no sound as the girls slip into their clothes kabnis still lies in bed

stella to halsey reckon y could spare us a light

halsey strikes a match lights a cigarette and then bends over and touches flame to the two candles on the table between the beds kabnis asks for a cigarette halsey hands him his and takes a fresh one for himself the girls before the mirror are doing up their hair it is bushy hair that has gone through some straightening process character however has not all been ironed out as they kneel there heavyeyed and dusky and throwing grotesque moving shadows on the wall they are two princesses in africa going through the earlymorning ablutions of their pagan prayers finished they come forward to stretch their hands and warm them over the glowing coals red dusk of a georgia sun230set their heavy coallit faces kabnis suddenly recalls something

kabnis th old man talked last night

halsey look out brother th old man’ll be getting int you by way o dreams come stel ready cora coffee an eggs f both of you

halsey goes upstairs

stella gettin generous aint he

she blows the candles out says nothing to kabnis then she and cora follow after halsey kabnis left to himself tries to rise he has slept in his robe his robe trips him finally he manages to stand up he starts across the floor halfway to the old man he falls and lies quite still perhaps an hour passes light of a new sun is about to filter through the windows kabnis slowly rises to support upon his elbows he looks hard and internally gathers himself together the side face of father john is in the direct line of his eyes he scowls at him no one is around words gush from kabnis

kabnis you sit there like a black hound spiked to an ivory pedestal an all night long i heard you murmurin that devilish word they thought i didnt hear y but i did mumblin feedin that ornery thing thats livin on my insides father john father of satan more likely what does it mean t you youre dead already death what does it mean t you to you who died way back there in th sixties what are y throwin it in my throat for whats it goin t get y a good smashin in th mouth thats what my fist’ll sink int y black mush face clear t y guts—if y got any dont believe y have never seen signs of none death death sin an death all night long y mumbled death he forgets the old man as his mind begins to play with the word and its associations death  these clammy floors  just like th place they used t stow away th wornout nocount niggers in th days of slavery  that was long ago not so long ago  no windows he rises higher on his elbows to verify this assertion he looks around and seeing no one but the old man calls halsey halsey gone an left me just like a nigger i thought he was a nigger all th time now i know it ditch y when it comes right down t it damn him anyway godam him he looks and resees the old man eh you t hell with you too what do i care whether you can see or hear you know what hell is cause youve been there its a feelin an its ragin in my soul in a way that’ll pop out of me an run you through an scorch y an burn an rip your soul your soul ha nigger soul a gin soul that gets drunk on a preacher’s words an screams an shouts god almighty how i hate that shoutin where’s th beauty in that gives a buzzard a windpipe an i’ll bet a dollar t a dime th buzzard ud beat y to it aint surprisin th white folks hate y so when you had eyes did you ever see th beauty of th world tell me that th hell y did now dont tell me i know y didnt you couldnt have oh i’m drunk an just as good as dead but no eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their sight you aint got no sight if you had drunk as i am i hope christ will kill me if i couldnt see it your eyes are dull and watery like fish eyes fish eyes are dead eyes youre an old man a dead fish man an black at that theyve put y here t die damn fool y are not t know it do y know how many feet youre under ground i’ll tell y twenty an do y think you’ll ever see th light of day again even if you wasnt blind do y think youre out of slavery huh youre where they used t throw th workedout nocount slaves on a damp clammy floor of a dark scumhole an they called that an infirmary th sonsa why i can already see you toppled off that stool an stretched out on th floor beside me—not beside me damn you by yourself with th flies buzzin an lickin god knows what they’d find on a dirty black foulbreathed mouth like yours

some one is coming down the stairs carrie bringing food for the old man she is lovely in her fresh energy of the morning in the calm untested confidence and nascent maternity which rise from the purpose of her present mission she walks to within a few paces of kabnis

carrie k brother says come up now brother ralph

kabnis brother doesnt know what he’s talkin bout

carrie k yes he does ralph he needs you on th wagon

kabnis he wants me on th wagon eh does he think some wooden thing can lift me up ask him that

kabnis no cant cant i tell you how’s he do it

carrie k dunno except i’ve heard that th souls of old folks have a way of seein things

kabnis an i’ve heard them call that superstition

the old man begins to shake his head slowly carrie and kabnis watch him anxiously he mumbles with a grave motion his head nods up and down and then on one of the downswings—

father john remarkably clear and with great conviction sin

he repeats this word several times always the downward nodding surprised indignant kabnis forgets that carrie is with him

kabnis sin shut up what do you know about sin you old black bastard shut up an stop that swayin an noddin your head

father john sin

kabnis tries to get up

kabnis didnt i tell y t shut up

carrie steps forward to help him kabnis is violently shocked at her touch he springs back

kabnis carrie what  how  baby you shouldnt be down here ralph says things doesnt mean to but carrie he doesnt know what he’s talkin about couldnt know it was only a preacher’s sin they knew in those old days an that wasnt sin at all mind me th only sin is whats done against th soul th whole world is a conspiracy t sin especially in america an against me i’m th victim of their sin i’m what sin is does he look like me have you ever heard him say th things youve heard me say he couldnt if he had th holy ghost t help him dont look shocked little sweetheart you hurt me

the old man’s lips begin to work words are formed incoherently finally he manages to articulate—

father john th sin whats fixed hesitates

carrie k restraining a comment from kabnis go on father

father john  upon th white folks—

kabnis suppose youre talkin about that bastard race thats roamin round th country it looks like sin if thats what y mean give us somethin new an up t date

father john—f tellin jesus—lies o th sin th white folks mitted when they made th bible lie

boom boom boom thuds on the floor above the old man sinks back into his stony silence carrie is weteyed kabnis contemptuous

kabnis so thats your sin all these years t tell us that th white folks made th bible lie well i’ll be damned lewis ought t have been here you old black fakir—

carrie k brother ralph is that your best amen

she turns him to her and takes his hot cheeks in her firm cool hands her palms draw the fever out with its passing kabnis crumples he sinks to his knees before her ashamed exhausted his eyes squeeze tight carrie presses his face tenderly against her the suffocation of her fresh starched dress feels good to him carrie is about to lift her hands in prayer when halsey at the head of the stairs calls down

halsey well well whats up aint you ever comin come on whats up down there take you all mornin t sleep off a pint youre weakenin man youre weakenin th axle an th beam’s all ready waitin f y come on

kabnis rises and is going doggedly towards the steps carrie notices his robe she catches up to him points to it and helps him take it off he hangs it with an exaggerated ceremony on its nail in the corner he looks down on the tousled beds his lips curl bitterly turning he stumbles over the bucket of dead coals he savagely jerks it from the floor and then seeing carrie’s eyes upon him he swings the pail carelessly and with eyes downcast and swollen trudges upstairs to the workshop carrie’s gaze follows him till he is gone then she goes to the old man and slips to her knees before him her lips murmur “jesus come”

light streaks through the ironbarred cellar window within its soft circle the figures of carrie and father john

outside the sun arises from its cradle in the treetops of the forest shadows of pines are dreams the sun shakes from its eyes the sun arises goldglowing child it steps into the sky and sends a birthsong slanting down gray dust streets and sleepy windows of the southern town
