i was born one morning in december on the coldest day
abandoned by my mother whom my father i was raised
my father raised my brother and i with a stubborn heart
my mother left me her good looks and confident charm
well i spent most of my teenage years searching for her love
i could not find it anywhere so i turned to drugs
and after all the smoke had cleared and it was said and done
i found myself addicted by the age of twenty one i tell the truth

verse 2
ive been beaten ive been bruised i was left for dead as well
i was wrongfully accused you left me locked inside a cell
ive been cheated ive been sued but i have lived to tell
the more you kick me when im down the more it truly helps
i feel the madness creeping slowly
loved by many im still lonely
pay the price for your mistake
the music died the day i walked away

chorus
no i wont let you win not this time my friend
you know that im better in the end
no you wont take my pride ill keep my head held high
cause i know that im better in the end
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 3
whoa i know youre jealous and you wish you could be me
im so smart and clever with my lyrics cant you see
theres nobody better in this music industry
and in case you think you are go ahead give me a ring
whoa i deserve a purple heart from all my fucking wounds
lacerations to my ego pride that ive consumed
and in your final hours when you are looking back
youll find that im the best at what i do and thats a fact

chorus
no i wont let you win not this time my friend
you know that im better in the end
no you wont take my pride ill keep my head held high
cause i know that im better in the end
