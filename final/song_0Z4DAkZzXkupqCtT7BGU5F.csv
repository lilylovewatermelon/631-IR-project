its like whatever i do ooh
just cant get through to you ooh ooh
im never gonna tell nothing wrong ooh ooh

verse 1
now now she loved me shawty i loved her
used to jump up in the maybach and roll out
used to care she used to share
the love that she used to give me cant be found
i lost my way she said shed stay
and lately ive been sleeping with a ghost
my stock is down and out i used to be worth my weight in gold
that was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
and that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
i told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
baby no worries i promise to get us back

chorus
i know sorries just wouldnt do it
her heart is obliterated
im trying to travel through
but its like moving mountains
its like moving mountains hey
but i keep climbing and hoping things would change
and the sky turns gray
and the water from the rain washes progress away
its like moving mountains moving mountains
its like moving mountains moving mountains
why you just leave me
just leave me be
just leave me
just leave me be
why you just leave me
just leave me be
why you just leave me
just leave me be
ooh ooh
be whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

she she dont touch me i dont touch her
we rarely even ever say a word
i really want to give her everything she deserves
but the bad took away the good
she thinks that im full of it arguments
always pissed man im tired
every kiss that i miss
girl you know im trying
you never believe when i say
and i never believe it when you say
i love you and i shouldnt complain about it
i should take it like a man and walk up out it
cause we will never be the same ooh
ive been standing in gas and you have been the flame

chorus
i know sorries just wouldnt do it
her heart is obliterated
im trying to get through
gotta move this mountain
its like moving mountains hey
but i keep climbing and hoping things would change
and the sky turns gray
and the water from the rain washes progress away
its like moving mountains moving mountains
its like moving mountains moving mountains
baby why you just leave me
just leave me be
just leave me
just leave me be
why you just leave me
just leave me be
why you just leave me
just leave me be

this must be a slow death that im traveling on
it feels so wrong im barely holding on
see no matter what it takes
ive gotta get it together baby yeah
and these hills that im traveling up
she aint showing me love
im down on my love
oh im down whoa

chorus
i know sorries just wouldnt do it
her heart is obliterated
im trying to travel through
but its like moving mountains
its like moving mountains moving this mountain ayy
but i keep climbing and hoping things would change
and the sky turns gray
and the water from the rain washes progress away
its like moving a mountain
