bye bye baby
bye bye baby

verse 1
out on a freight train was only passing through
i know how it feels yeah i know how it feels
that open road got me reaching for my boots
its crying for my wheels its crying for my wheels
so baby dry your eyes
you shouldnt be surprised

chorus
goodbye is just too hard to say
so lets just say ill see you again
and i already miss you so baby let me kiss you
before i head back to where ive always been
somewhere on the wind
somewhere on the wind

verse 2
and i wish sometimes that i could hang around
long enough to hang my hat but i dont look like that
by morrow night ill be south and nowhere bound
youll be loner on that bed one more thing that i regret
just like every river bends
that how every hello ends
see midland liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
goodbye is just too hard to say
so lets just say ill see you again
and i already miss you so baby let me kiss you
before i head back to where ive always been
somewhere on the wind
somewhere on the wind

just like every river bends
that how every hello ends

chorus
goodbye is just too hard to say
so lets just say ill see you again
and i already miss you so baby let me kiss you
before i head back to where ive always been
somewhere on the wind
somewhere on the wind

outro
somewhere on the wind
bye bye babyembed"
