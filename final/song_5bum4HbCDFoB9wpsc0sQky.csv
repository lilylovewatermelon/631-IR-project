you look out the window while i look at you
saying i dont know would be like saying that the sky aint blue
and boots werent made for sitting by the door
since you dont wanna stay anymore

chorus
you can have your space cowboy
i aint gonna fence you in
go on ride away in your silverado
guess ill see you round again
i know my place and it aint with you
well sunsets fade and love does too
yeah we had our day in the sun
when a horse wants to run there aint no sense in closing the gate
you can have your space cowboy

verse 2
after the gold rush there aint no reason to stay
shoulda learned from the movies that good guys dont run away
but roads werent made to not go down
and there aint room for both of us in this town

chorus
so you can have your space cowboy
i aint gonna fence you in
go on ride away in your silverado
ill see you around again
cause i know my place and it aint with you
sunsets fade and love does too
we had our day in the sun
when a horse wants to run aint no sense in closing the gate
so you can have your space

you can have your space cowboy
i aint gonna fence you in
go on ride away in your silverado
ill see you around again
cause i know my place and it aint with you
sunsets fade and love does too
though we had our day in the sun
when a horse wants to run aint no sense in closing the gate
you can have your space
yeah you can have your space
you can have your space cowboy12embed"
