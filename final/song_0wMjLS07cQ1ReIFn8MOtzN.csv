i gotta pour me some more muhfuckin mud
you know that the double r black droc

refrain
shawty hold it down for her nigga you know that i fuck with that fuck with that
shawty ride around in a new maybach
you know i stay loaded off codeine and xans
i got the bag i aint showin my hand
i take your ho and put her in a lamb
i got the aston martin liftin up skrrt
and i got that plate of money runnin up
and one diamond two diamond im doubled they flooded up

chorus
had to spend me a bag for to rock this shit
cut off the money i find if she lyin to me
you know my criteria resemble a dealer
you know i splurge on her until i could spin her
you know for a fact that im takin her down
big diamond like crystal i know she a winner
dont like when i ditch her lil shawty too tempered
turn up on these niggas when i try do double up double up

verse 1
i done ran up my ms they know i fuck it up
chase that money real fast run it up stack it up
hit the curb in maybach and it long like a bus
i cant settle for one all these hoes i done fucked
spend a check on ap one for her and for her
got my fit lookin like that i sponsor cigar
and you know that its tough thats a moncler puff
bitch you know im a thug
chill all day back to back sip mud
dont care what type of nigga that her last dude was
and i aint even really tryna trip bout the girl
fuck with her i give her money up and now i blew a dub
twenty ball came from the extras that i paid for the case
cause the court got a case on us
dont care what they say they cant x out us
louis straight from new york been the one since the start
this a rich nigga heart

bought a watch i dont know why i started up
from the start i just knew that she aint gon be hard to fuck

and you know that mclaren dont get drove for nothin
im gon forever live if my name die
ima stack up that money foreverever
