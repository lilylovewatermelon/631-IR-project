dodgin my eyes
hug me goodbye but you don’t hold as tight

eight hours later you say your phone died yeah i bet
prechorus
yeah youve been actin differently
ever since we bumped into your ex last week
oh what a night that was
funny how you fight with me but you don’t wanna fight for us
thought you were in love with me but then again i saw the way you looked at him
chorus
so go
no i wont hold you back anymore i wont hold you back anymore
just go
no you dont have to lie anymore you dont have to lie anymore
ooh yeah

tellin me we need to talk but
