forever unstoppable
forever forever forever unstoppable

verse 1
falling stars dont crash through your window
if you want it go get it
its meant to be chased
all your scars wont heal til you let go
youre perfectly worth it
forget your mistakes
if you wanna fly
leave this world with me
well touch the sky lets defy this gravity
hold on to me tight
when it all falls down

chorus
you can take my heart if yours wont beat
were forever unstoppable
if youre torn apart ill make you see
that nothings impossible
when youre broken and youre shattered
love will save you from disaster
you can take my heart if yours wont beat
were forever forever forever unstoppable

yeah weve both been touched by the same flame
dont worry i got ya

for better or worse
if you wanna fly
leave this world with me
well touch the sky lets defy this gravity
hold on to me tight
when it all falls down

chorus
you can take my heart if yours wont beat
were forever unstoppable
if youre torn apart ill make you see
that nothings impossible
when youre broken and youre shattered
love will save you from disaster

just dying to break through
