verse 1
swervin on the eway on the e its bout six
chains across a nigga neck it cost me a brick
throw away the burner and you know i had to throw away my bitch medusa got that pressure
cross that line nigga top gon introduce you to some raw shit
new 23 i bought this they dont know nothin bout this know nothin bout
tryna flash em blast em smash em then go change my outfit
goldmans sachs got that 4 magnum i be on straight boss shit
bullets faded like ross i let you have em if you cross me
its a new patek my nigga im strapped up they aint check my denim
