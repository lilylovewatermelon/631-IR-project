verse 1
i said my solo jump off been boomin since ninesix
my solo jump off been boomin since ninesix
hittin trippin the circuit breaker flickin the light switch
the kid like is he known for givin you wild hits
i keep my name on the way on top of the now list
bangin on every level droppin the now shit
its like the feelin after watchin a couple of  flick
and once you hear the kid youll be knowin the sound sick
spaz in the club watchin the crowd flip
thats when i knew the crown was up for whoever the crown fit
nowadays while i go bag me a fine bitch
bitch watchin my pocket seein we wild rich
shorty hopin we smellin nothin like foul fish
while you swingin ass at the devil claimin you righteous
a lot of haters im knowin you like this
while you floss unnecessarily sippin on wild crist

hook
i say ladies my mercedes hey
hold fo in the back two if you fat hey
feel it all in your gut your neck and your back
when you step up in the club i know you know how to act
hey soldiers get your floss on hey
valet in the lot park the yukon hey
shorty shakin her waist and rippin her thong hey
now all my people are muggin and singin the song im sayin
see busta rhymes liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeverse 2
shit still boomin in twothousand and three
my shit still boomin in twothousand and three
and we dont give a fuck about who you claimin to be
my jewels blind bitches where they aint able to see
these fools try to talk just a little much to a g
they say the wrong shit they head just might end upside of a tree
clear my thoughts just a little pass me a cup of tea
takin different constant boats from the land to the sea
i got my paper see i aint doin nuttin for free
unless its for the hood it might cost you a small fee
niggas all in the street whylin whippin the v
clever from new york to chicago back to the d
check it take it back like when i was flippin a ki
bonin chicks holdin titties like they was pamela lee
you know i mastered the art and got it down to a tee
and keep it goin add enough spice we holdin the recipe
big paper we makin all of my crew agree
stack more and bust up a bottle of hennessy
in case you niggas aint even knowin my pedigree
invested in resorts for the niggas who go and ski
if you aint know the streets is belongin to me
i get my people from the hood and then take em all on a spree shoppin
while you niggas is busy coppin the pleas
we busy blowin frontin like you aint knowin my stee
hook
i say ladies my mercedes hey
hold fo in the back two if you fat hey
feel it all in your gut your neck and your back
when you step up in the club i know you know how to act
hey soldiers get your floss on hey
valet in the lot park the yukon hey
shorty shakin her waist and rippin her thong hey
now all my people are muggin and singin the song im sayin
