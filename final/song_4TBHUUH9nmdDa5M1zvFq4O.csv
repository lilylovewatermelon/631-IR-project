love for me hasnt been easy
ive let true love fall to the ground
through the years and the tears
ive learned what loves about
and this time ill be ready
when love comes around

chorus
when love comes around ill be ready
love will find me a brand new man
and ill be standing here
with my heart in my hand
this time ill be ready
when love comes around

verse 2
too many times ive lost a good love
and i can see now i let it down
but if love comes back to me
it wont see the same old me
this time ill be ready
when love comes around

chorus
when love comes around ill be ready
love will find me a brand new man
and ill be standing here
with my heart in my hand
this time ill be ready
when love comes around
