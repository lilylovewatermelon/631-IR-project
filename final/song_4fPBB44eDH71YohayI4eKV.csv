some people think theyre always right
others are quiet and uptight

inside they might feel sad and wrong oh no
twentynine different attributes
only seven that you like oh
twenty ways to see the world oh
and twenty ways to start a fight oh

oh dont dont dont get up
i cant see the sunshine
ill be waiting for you baby
cause im through
sit me down
shut me up
ill calm down
and ill get along with you

verse 2
oh men dont notice what they got
oh women think of that a lot
one thousand ways to please your man oh
not even one requires a plan i know
and countless odd religions too
it doesnt matter which you choose oh no
one stubborn way to turn your back oh
this ive tried and now refuse oh
