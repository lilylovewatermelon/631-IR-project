theres nothing to do here
all just lie and complain
in bed at the hospital
coming and going
asleep and awake
in bed at the hospital

prechorus
ive got one friend
laying across from me
i did not choose him
he did not choose me
we have no chance
of recovering
laying in hospitals
joy and misery
joy and misery
joy and misery

chorus 1
put out the fire boys
dont stop dont stop
put out the fire on us
put out the fire boys
dont stop dont stop
put out the fire on us

bring your buckets by the dozen
bring your nieces and your cousins
oh put out the fire on us
bring your buckets by the dozen
bring your nieces and your cousins
oh put out the fire on us

prechorus
ive got one friend
laying across from me
i did not choose him
he did not choose me
we have no chance
of recovering
laying in hospitals
joy and misery
joy and misery
