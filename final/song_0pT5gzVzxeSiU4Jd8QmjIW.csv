war war war
talking about yous such a bore
id rather talk about moi
like do you know the cost of aks up in africa
20 dollars aint shit to you
but thats how much they are
so theyre gonna use the shit just to get far
is gold diamonds helping ya
dont you like my bandanna bandana
my stains hang low on my shirts like ayyaya
got monkey brains and banana
ill hit you with my antenna
i put soap in my eye
make it red so i look rawrrawrrawr
so i woke up with my holy quran
and found out i like cadillac
so were shootin until the sun is up
little boys are acting up
and baby mothers are going crazy
and the leaders all around cracking up
we goatrich we fry
price of livin in a shanty town just seems very high
but we still like ti
but we still look fly
dancin as were shootin up
and lootin just to get by huh
see mia liveget tickets as low as 146you might also likehook
with your feet on the air
your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it  yeah
your headll collapse when theres nothin in it
and youll ask yourself
where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind
huh

verse 2
war war war
who made me like this
was it me and god in coproduction
my devils on speeddial
every time i take the wrong direction
all i want is one thing and that is what you got
sometimes i go and lose my mind then i feel numb
theres 24 hours in a day
i used to spilt it 8 8 8
8  work 8  sleep
and 8 for play
now i give it all it takes
now people on the internet
a new life for the intellect
people judge me so hard cause i dont floss my titties out
i was born out of dirt like im porn in a skirt
i was a little girl who made good well au revoir adieu
i put people on the map that never seen a map
ive showed em something theyve never seen
and hope they make it back
hook
with your feet on the air
your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it  yeah
your headll collapse when theres nothin in it
and youll ask yourself
where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind
huh
with your feet on the air
your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it  yeah
your headll collapse when theres nothin in it
and youll ask yourself
where is my mind1embed"
