the way you stumble in the kitchen
looking for that first cup of joe
how you put on your mascara
staring in the mirror on your tippytoes
and if you wonder why i love you baby
i can boil it down to just one thing

chorus
yeah everything
every little thing about you baby turns me on
if it aint one thing its another
i cant explain
how everything about you turns me on
if it aint one thing its another
oh it turns me on on on
on on on
on on on
on on on

verse 2
the sexy way you say hey baby
when you see my number on your phone
the way you bit your lip when mama said
you cooked the chicken way too long
girl be careful what you do and say
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
yeah everything
every little thing about you baby turns me on
if it aint one thing its another
i cant explain
how everything about you turns me on
if it aint one thing its another
oh it turns me on on on
on on on
on on on
on on on

outro
the way you walk the way you smile
the way you kiss it drives me wild
the way you laugh the way you sing
girl you know its everything
the way you talk the way you drive
the way you make me feel alive
the way you whisper i love you
everything you do just turns me on on on
on on on
on on on
on on onembed"
