this is my word this is my way
show me a sign sweep me away
this is my word heartbreaker gatekeeper
im feeling far away im feeling right there
deep in my heart deep in my mind
take me away take me away
this is my word dream maker life taker
open up my mind

chorus
all i believe is it a dream
that comes crashing down on me
all that i hope
is it just smoke and mirrors
i want to believe whoa
but all that i know
is it just smoke and mirrors mirrors mirrors

verse 2
all that ive known buildings of stone
fall to the ground without a sound
this is my word heartbreaker gatekeeper
im feeling far away im feeling right there
im starting to cave im losing my flame
i wanted your truth but i wanted the pain
to disappear dream maker life taker
open up my mind
