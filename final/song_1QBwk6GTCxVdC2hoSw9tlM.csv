verse 1 drake  rick ross
its your worst nightmare its my first night here
and this girl right here who knows what she knows
so im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there i dont trust these hoes at all
but thats just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple pornstars that im ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
haffa and jordan my only role models
thats why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bought em sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
all of the little accents that make me a king
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
but its whatever if somebody wont make it a thing
im more concerned with niggas thinkin bout christmas in august
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs fields they makin the cookie stretch
i know it so well i know the hustle so well
stunt like im working overnighters right by the motel
drug money outfit record clean
spend it all on me and my fuckin team
matchin rollies for real matchin rovers for real woo
places they say theyve been we actually goin for real woo
im really killin shit fuck all the jiggy rappin woo
im going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
mixtape legend underground kings
lookin for the right way to do the wrong things huh
with my new bitch thats livin in palm springs
youngass nigga lifelong dreams
they take the greats from the past and compare us
i wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
in a time where its recreation
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be pokin fun at
never the flow though they know i run that
fuck you all i claim that whenever
i changed rap forever the game back together yeah
ym i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne at forever
im a descendant of either marley or hendrix
i havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
im hearing all of the jokes i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin emotion dont ever mean im a pussy
know that i dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows lord knows im heavy i got my weight up
roberson boost the rate up its time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me then who should i be afraid of
bought a white ghost now shit is gettin spooky
very very scary like shit you see in the movies
in this bitch all drinks on the house like snoopy
thats why all the real soldiers salute me
trill nigga for real

verse 2 rick ross
i fell in love with the pen started fuckin the ink huh
the hustles an art i painted what i would think
still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper
destined for greatness but got a place in jamaica woo
villa on the water with the wonderful views
only fat nigga in the sauna with jews
went and got a yacht im talkin carnival cruise
and these niggas talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
its the red bottom boss huh came to buy the bar huh
every biweek shit im bound to buy a car woo
murdercedes benz or that bubble doubler woo
headlights flickin lookin like a falling star
every day them hammers bang whippin yay like anna mae
i run the game but the ladies think im runnin game
mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
rozay and drake im getting cake nothin short of great huh58embed"
