dont wait for an invitation

ill be your transportation
well find theres a kind of place
that can only be seen with a naked mind

the sun does shine
we cant wait one minute more
the sun does shine

theres a key that opens a door
will you find it and turn it
take your time dont take too long
theres a map thats washed ashore
will you find it and burn it

unleash your imagination
two stars one constellation
bright lights just to guide the way
can you see what i see in you

we cant wait one minute more
the sun does shine
