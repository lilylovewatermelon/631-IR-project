youre kissing me
and saying im the one you need
to keep you warm
and lay with you tonight
baby i feel the same way
i dont want to leave
wanna hold you close
and feel your love inside
but i dont wanna play myself
cause i know youre with someone else
and i dont need complications in my life
and i dont wanna fall back in
and get caught up in you again
boy im so conflicted in my mind

chorus
you keep saying stay the night
just let me rock you
till the morning light
its cold outside
and much too late to drive
you know i need you baby
im so lost without your love

verse 2
obviously procrastinating just to be
close to you a little longer now
its hard for me
to break away from you baby
never could resist you
and i still havent learned how
and i dont wanna be a fool
but its hard when it comes to you
and im feeling vulnerable tonight
cause i dont wanna miss the chance
of reliving our sweet romance
boy im so confused down deep inside
