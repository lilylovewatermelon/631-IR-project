ive fought it for a long time now
while drowning in a river of denial
i washed up fixed up picked up all my broken things
cause you left me policetape chalkline
tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
suburban living with a feeling that im giving up
everything for you

chorus
ohohoh how was i supposed to know
that you were ohohover me
i think that i should go go
and somethings telling me to leave but i wont
cause im damned if i do ya damned if i dont

verse 2
it took a lot to take you home
one stupid call and i end up alone
youre made up dressed up messed up plans i set in stone
but you made me do when i dont like
dancing in the alley with the streetrat nightlife
cant keep living with a feeling that im giving up everything for you

chorus
ohohoh how was i supposed to know
that you were ohohover me
i think that i should go go
and somethings telling me to leave but i wont
cause im damned if i do ya damned if i dont
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likebridge
make a fool of myself when you hang around
when youre gone im a match thats burning out
could have been should have done what i said i was going to do
said that i would do
but i never promised you
but i never promised you promised you

chorus
ohohoh how was i supposed to know
that you were ohohover me
i think that i should go go
it never took a fool to see the things that i wont
cause im damned if i do ya damned if i do ya

outro
ohohoh how was i supposed to know
cause you left me police tape chalk line
that you were ohohover me i think that i should go
tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
somethings telling me to leave but i wont
cause im damned if i do ya damned if i ddd
damned if i do ya damned if i dont6embed"
