shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh

verse 1
shes falling but she doesnt think hell catch her
cause her last relationship was a disaster
accusations everyday she didnt know why
all her calls would be ignored hes on his own time
shouldve ended it before it started
all she ever got was broken hearted
he was cheating on her trying to flip it
back on her like a victim
now she all alone and starting over
now she got baggage on her shoulder
but the new guy really loves her
she loves him but she doesnt trust herself anymore

chorus
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
you might also likeverse 2
despite her past she cant help the attraction
he tells her that hes nothing like the last one
he redefines in every way what love is
she fell for him and hasnt gotten up since
every now and then she goes off though
beating on his chest like a bongo
he understands shes coming from a hurt place
answers all the questions on her survey
doesnt get jealous doesnt break trust
doesnt call her ho after hangups
give her everything she ever wanted
and even though she still feels haunted

chorus
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
