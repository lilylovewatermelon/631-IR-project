im always looking for
something i cant afford
something to work for
i dont know if its healthy
oh god help me
i wanna be satisfied with what i have
im always chasing higher placement
this bump is not enough
and when i hoo hit the pavement
dont save me
im such a waste of space

im always waiting for the weekend
im always hoping for a reset yeah
i will be happy when im older
why is everything never good enough for me
why is everything never

starting to blur
waiting for the tidе to wash me out
clean me up

im always waking up
looking to fill my cup
im such a loser
cause i got it all right in front of me
everything i could need
i wanna be satisfied with what i have
if i put that smile on
i turn my light on
maybe i believe it too
but i dont know if my heads right
im waking all night
you should give up the fight

prechorus
im always waiting for the weekend
im always hoping for a reset yeah
i will be happy when im older
why is everything never good enough for me
why is everything never

im never satisfied im
starting to blur
waiting for the tide to wash me out
clean me up
cause i am starting to blur
im never satisfied im
