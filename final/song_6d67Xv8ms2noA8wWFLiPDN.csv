your word and my word and your word is
tomorrow today and yesterday
but its a necessary evil
and you will find your way there
your feelings and mine are all holy and
you give me an inner sanctity
you feel the same way that i do for you about her
your word and my word and her word is
yesterday today and tomorrow
and twilight gives me an inner sanctity

chorus 1
and youre feeling
and youre hungry for her
and you dont understand it
but you know you havent planned it

verse 2
your feelings and mine are all lonely
and dawn comes youre there lying with me
and you reach out to touch me
but i am in the twilight
your feelings and mine are all holy but
you know and i know its untrue because
when day dawns youre there lying with me
and the dawn can fly away

and you know i love you but you know that
theres nothing you can do about it
because you love her
and you still love me

bridge
if i could be her
but im not her and shes not me
and youre somewhere different
on a different planet

chorus 3
and you still want it
the inner sanctity
and its an evil
but the evil is necessary yeah

outro
and youre still hungry for her
and you still want her loving
but she doesnt love you oh yeah14embed"
