faces skating skyward
places i could be
cardboard houses swaying
from that sunlit seas
the creatures creep in thirsty for their fill
to hold me underwater till im still

chorus
i could always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow
i might always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow

verse 2
cement inside my ribcage
hardening to stone
too late now its passed you
walk the railway tracks until youre home
tired as the pavements underfoot
tired as the pavements underfoot
water never stays where it is put

chorus
i might always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow
i might always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow

verse 3
and each path im taking course
ever alone as night falls oh oh oh ooh
hearts still beating black and blue
times still passing never you

i could always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow
i could always try again tomorrow try again tomorrow x21embed"
