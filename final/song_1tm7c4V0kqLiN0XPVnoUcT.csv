when you come home ill stop this
when you come home ill stop this

verse 1 ruby da cherry
view from a balcony pool lit up blue
lawn chairs next to the ice chest
stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
now im getting blown by a bitch
who i dont know her name
gold chain hanging got a few in the room
but i dont wear them out only wear them in the house
cause i shine so bright i dont wanna blind you
who knew yung now wouldnt melt in the summer its true
cold as a polar bear
chilling with stunna and lick im surrounded by tulips
got me bout two clips
got me bout two scripts filled up with oxy
smoke hovers all around my fucking body
i murdered this bitch named oddy yeah i shot him
lick got the shovels and we digging all night
pouya in the caddy
told him shine the light bright cause im digging in darkness
what was a good day has turned into the usual
back in all black like a funeral

verse 2 yung carecrow
runnin from the cops through the motherfucking 7th
six bodies dropped and nobody went to heaven
block stay hot when im creeping with the weapon
gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
city of the crescent riding with a smith and wesson
got a motherfucker guessing when i hit em with the blessing
two shots to the dome six shots in the chrome
all shot through your home now thats a crime zone
uicide
carecrow creepin with uzi
lucifer please come save me
throw crucifixes at my feet
walking through the depths of hell
watchin as the oceans swell
grey59 thats los cartel
nothing but death in every cell

chorus marie therese
when you come home ill stop this
when you come home ill stop this
verse 3 pouya
yuh she too deep in the flask
drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
déjà vu ive been through it with you
multiple times on many occasions
contemplating vacating without you i doubt you the one
i could be wrong i could be sprung i could be dumb
i could be dumbfounded wellrounded
plus the head game therapeutic
she knew when she blew it like nintendo you heard me
some of yall better curve me my dick game army strong
my only hope is my song go on for long
this life aint promised whether you accomplished
what you think about inside of yo apartment
you working for nothing you worthless bitch
yuh

chorus marie therese
when you come home ill stop this
