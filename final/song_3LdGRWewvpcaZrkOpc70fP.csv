in a perfect world
youre understanding im not a perfect girl
i would drop my fears at the door
i would only bring myself and nothing more
and you let me be a woman
and you let me be a flawed woman
you would yearn to hear all about my past
what ive done what ive did and why
hear all my sick thoughts
and if i needed to i could cry
and you would catch my tears
you dont wanna be nobody elses place no aye no
you dont wanna be nobody elses place to hide from themselves

chorus
shame
and im the one to blame

bridge
you see right through me
you see through the smile
you see straight through me
you push past the lies oh
you got it baby
oh oh ohsee summer walker liveget tickets as low as 238you might also like3embed"
