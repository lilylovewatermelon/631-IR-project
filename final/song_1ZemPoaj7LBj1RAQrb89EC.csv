i used to say i was free
now all these people wanna keep on takin pieces of me
they take away everything had everything that i needed
they held me down let me drown
they spit me out right through the teeth
i cant pretend ash in the wind wont blow again
it was a breeze for you breeze for you
these hurricanes inside of my brain let it rain made it look easy cant look away you love the pain you love the pain

prechorus
watchin me bleed
you cut me down on my knees
no matter what you believe
i think we both can agree

chorus
that you cant blame it on me ayy
its not my fault its not my fault its not my fault
blame it on me ayy
its not my fault its not my fault its not my fault
i couldnt breathe
almost lost myself couldnt stop myself i did it all
you cant blame it on me ayy
its not my fault its not my fault its not my fault

every days the same yeah i just watch em go
as i scrape away through the impossible
yeah i played the game but it was all for show
tryna find my way i nearly lost it though
now i see dead people most have no faith
where did the time go a watch with no face
they hit the ceilin but my roof likes space
i took my chances so wont you

chorus
blame it on me ayy
its not my fault its not my fault its not my fault
blame it on me ayy
