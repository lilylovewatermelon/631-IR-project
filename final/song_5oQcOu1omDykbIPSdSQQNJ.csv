debbie just hit the wall she never had it all
one prozac a day husbands a cpa
her dreams went out the door when she turned twentyfour
only been with one man what happened to her plan

prechorus 1
she was gonna be an actress she was gonna be a star
she was gonna shake her ass on the hood of whitesnakes car
her yellow suv is now the enemy
looks at her average life and nothing has been alright

chorus
since bruce springsteen madonna way before nirvana
there was u2 and blondie and music still on mtv
her two kids in high school they tell her that shes uncool
cause shes still preoccupied with 19 19 1985 1985

verse 2
shes seen all the classics she knows every line
breakfast club pretty in pink even saint elmos fire
she rocked out to wham not a big limp bizkit fan
thought shed get a hand on a member of duran duran

prechorus 2
wheres the miniskirt made of snake skin
and whos the other guy thats singing in van halen
when did reality become tv
whatever happened to sitcoms game shows
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likechorus
on the radio was springsteen madonna way before nirvana
there was u2 and blondie and music still on mtv
her two kids in high school they tell her that shes uncool
cause shes still preoccupied with 19 19 1985

bridge
she hates time make it stop
when did mötley crüe become classic rock classic rock
and when did ozzy become an actor
please make this stop stop stop

chorus
and bring back springsteen madonna way before nirvana
there was u2 and blondie and music still on mtv
her two kids in high school they tell her that shes uncool
cause shes still preoccupied with 1985
