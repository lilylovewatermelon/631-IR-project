verse 1
in the land of gods and monsters
i was an angel living in the garden of evil
screwed up scared doing anything that i needed
shining like a fiery beacon

prechorus
you got that medicine i need
fame liquor love give it to me slowly
put your hands on my waist do it softly
me and god we dont get along so now i sing

chorus
no ones gonna take my soul away
im living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees sprees and im singing
fuck yeah give it to me this is﻿ heaven what i truly want
its innocence lost innocence lost

verse 2
in the land of gods and monsters
i was an angel looking to get fucked hard
like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
life imitates art

chorus
no ones gonna take my soul away

headed towards a fucked up holiday

chorus
no ones gonna take my soul away
im living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees sprees and im singing
fuck yeah give it to me this is﻿ heaven what i truly want
its innocence lost innocence lost153embed"
