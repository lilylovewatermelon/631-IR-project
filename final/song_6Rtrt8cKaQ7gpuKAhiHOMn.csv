i think im ready
i think ive got it
cause too much thinking is bad for my health
its like a fire
cause when i start it i cant control it and i burn myself
but i cant just sit here and watch it
if we dont stop it no one will

hook
we are the ones
we are the guns
and we will ride
we are the voice of a song unsung
we are the change
we are the chains that hold us
we are the choice
we are the strong
we are one

verse 2
my heart is racing
just like a rocket
victory looks like a distant dream
cause what were fighting
not gonna stop it
but we can beat it if we just believe
i cant just sit here and watch it
if we dont stop it no one will
