verse 1 mac miller
im in a room filled with holographic images
path is limitless death well thats ridiculous
ima live forever cause a legend never die
see the world as simple but complex in the design
i spent some time just thinkin
where did that get me high more drinkin
now my head empty so can it last a couple minutes more
pain a funny thing when you cant figure out the source
bear witness while im checkin bitches off my hit list
try to understand the fuckin message i encrypted
ancient halucinatin visions of utopia
until i figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
never hold my tongue vocal as a loaded gun
and ima shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
mac miller im the only one
but im the coldest one this is pandemonium

chorus mac miller
got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split uh
hand on my nuts when im wilin out in public yeah
welcome to america uh
motherfucker welcome to america yeah
my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split uh
hands on my nuts while im wilin out in public yeah
welcome to america uh
motherfucker welcome to america yeah

still in a room filled with holographic images
crushin information into powder then im sniffin it
directly to my head never sleep or use my bed
iller than the future death of you ingestin sudafed
might head to budapest just to get a gucci vest
hop into a jet get some rest to diffuse the stress uh
see this is what i do the best
nothin that you got except the bullet gettin through my chest
save hard a braveheart a warrior
i take part to stay far from coroners
i heard some corny words said about my music though
talkin all that shit sound exactly like a groupie ho
most dope got you hooked yellin rufio
first you lose your mind then you lose your soul
so what you talkin about thinkin you out of options
american born impeccable form
above and beyond never the norm

chorus mac miller
got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split uh
hand on my nuts when im wilin out in public yeah

my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split uh
hands on my nuts while im wilin out in public yeah

shout out my wigga mac miller comin up in a world full of killers

with a girl that know what the deal is

city on the map we dont know how to act ah

bad chicks get tossed around like the merrygo
cv and mac meezy takin off on pjs

sittin in the studio chain on and my hat low
young visionaries and we sellin out the rap show
i can trigger the wave in my sleep

wake up shower get paid and repeat
spit one flow and got made on the streets
welcome to the land where you never stay for free
swag worth a mill drop cast let it deal

verse 4 joey bada
bout to drop hot shit runnin out of patience niggas not sick
rollin up the dankest loud plane goin mach 6
rise to the top and topics change
to glocks and the stock exchange
now watch the price of life on the block drop insane
you cant stop this reign dont namedrop in vain
inhale toxic flames from tropic strains its awkward strange
last week he was nothin boxers stain
now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
to the top i aim testin waters so ive been afloat
no deal but flow so real he been in the scopes
sun got shine now they say he shady but he never dippin though
still facin ls you would think a nigga wins was low
what you think im in this for
wont stop til the nigga who invented dope
end the flow or behind bars droppin prison soap
beggin for forgiveness but its business though
im record spittin guinness flows
got it up in sources now he in the store
