crossing the street on passionate gates

and its okay all the suffering obliterates our speed
but dont you wait dont you wait for the faster you let go you will receive what you need

since you moved in youve been on a different page
youve been out of commission hiding in the kitchen
freddy came over and you couldnt even listen
its a great escape from your heartache its your replay
its a great escape from your heartache its your replay
and its okay all the suffering obliterates our speed
but dont you wait dont you wait for the faster you let go you will receive what you need
