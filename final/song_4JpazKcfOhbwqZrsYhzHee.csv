so tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
no better version of me i could pretend to be tonight
soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
for reasons wretched and divine

verse 2
she blows out of nowhere a roman candle of the wild
laughing her way through my feeble disguise
no other version of me i would rather be tonight
and lord she found me just in time

prechorus
cause with my midyouth crisis all said and done
i need to be youthfully felt cause god i never felt young

chorus
shes gonna save me call me baby
run her hands through my hair
shell know me crazy soothe me daily
better yet she wouldnt care
well steal her lexus be detectives
ride round picking up clues
well name our children jackie and wilson
raise em on rhythm and blues
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeverse 3
lord itd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
me and my isis growing black irises in the sunshine
every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
wed sit back and watch the world go by

prechorus
happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
we tried the world good god it wasnt for us

chorus
shes gonna save me call me baby
run her hands through my hair
shell know me crazy soothe me daily
better yet she wouldnt care
well steal her lexus be detectives
ride round picking up clues
well name our children jackie and wilson
raise em on rhythm and blues

verse 4
cut clean from the dream at night let my mind reset
looking up from a cigarette shes already left
i start digging up the yard for whats left of me in our little vignette
for whatever poor soul is coming next
chorus
shes gonna save me call me baby
run her hands through my hair
shell know me crazy soothe me daily
better yet she wouldnt care
well steal her lexus be detectives
ride round picking up clues
well name our children jackie and wilson
raise em on rhythm and blues44embed"
