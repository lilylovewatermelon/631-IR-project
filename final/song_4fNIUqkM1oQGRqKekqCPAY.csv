verse 1
im not gon waste ya time talkin bout shit that you know
im so hood that even when i try to hide it it shows
i be grindin girl im focused i be gettin my dough
you know that if it aint the flow than it comes from the os
plus a nigga like a pimp when it comes to the hoes
every hood every city all the gangstas now
front on me and youll be gettin hit up fa sho
i make it hot when its twenty muthafuckin below
see wit me in vip you can twist and blow
when the champagne finished baby order some mo
keep a eye on you close while you out on the floor
doin ya move will have a niggas greased if its a swole
if ya ready to roll shorty we can just roll
when you ready to go ill be ready to go
see everything i do i do on the low
so anything we do nobody will know

now look i know you into the shiny things

the twentyfour inch chrome on the range
i see you when you crouch by ya window pane
now shorty me and you we came up the same

i hustled got my weight up now im sittin on change
i mean i got money out the ass maine
when niggas get the beefin i be laughin
cause i can send my homies through to blast them
stick em with the hump or just slash em
now fool are you crazy is what we ask em
but back to me and you shorty decide think

leave it up to me we can do it my way uhoh
and get straight to it skip the fore play uhoh
