dreamin again of a train track endin at the edge of the sea
big black cloud was low and rollin our way
dog at the barbed wire barkin at my buzz cut friends and me
sound of a switchblade shinin in the summer rain

chorus
no one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone ooh
everybody bitchin theres nothin on the radio

verse 2
dreamin again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes
chatterin boys and a chicken at the choppin block
all of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
didnt find a friend but boy i really bought a lot

chorus
someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasnt coming home ooh
everybody bitchin theres nothin on the radio

verse 3
dreamin again that its freezin and my mothers in her flowerbed
long dead rows of daffodil and marigold
changin her face like a shadow on the gravel this is what she said
blood on my chin still chewin on a red rose
see iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus
no one lives forever and the devil never sleeps alone ooh
everybody bitchin theres nothin on the radioembed"
