yeee yeah

verse 1
dont wake me up
if im sleeping this life away
tell me that ill never be good enough
sometimes it hurts to think it could really be that way
it wont be that way
im tired and im lost i dont wanna be found
i put my heart and my soul and strength in this now
so forgive me cause i wont forget that
yeah this world has changed me so you know when you ask me

chorus
who are you now
did you say what you want
dont go back to the start
im asking who are you now
did they break you apart
wont you fight back for what you want

and sometimes you really live youve gotta try

that what we felt in our hearts was real the whole time
when you open up your eyes i hope that you find
who you are who you are
