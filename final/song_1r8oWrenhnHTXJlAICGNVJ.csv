ooh ooh
ooh ooh

verse 1 rachael price
look at those lights behind the trees
dont the highway sound like the ocean
lookin at you right next to me
the stillness feels like commotion

i got the feelin
you got the feelin
dont you know what i mean

verse 2 rachael price
giddy like high school down by the pool
at the hotel in reseda
if i didnt know all the things youve done
id swear that i need ya

i got the feelin
you got the feelin
but i know where you been

chorus
i wish i would have met you
when i was seventeen
before i seen the things that ive seen
before i learned to look behind the screen
i think we could have had a good time

oh oh

verse 3 mike calabrese
well i used to get down in any town
any time i got the notion
follow each girl to the end of the world
you know i never looked down
but now im up above with the feelin of love
i got my arms around you
but the weight of the band on my left hand
you know it keeps me on the ground

baby i got the feelin
you got the feelin
dont you know what i mean

chorus
i wish id met you
when i was seventeen
before i kept my hands so clean
before you went and made some fool your queen
i think we could have had a good time

oh yeah
oh yeah
