verse
i got the game on ball and chain
i threw the key in the drain im like a key in a drought
i spent a g on these frames but my vision is priceless
seeing through you niggas like a fuckin psychic
hearing through the grapevine niggas wanna hate mine
say my name and die in the daytime
you catch my drift man you better be peyton
boy the heats on they makin peace bonds
im in this bitch throwin up the 17th sign
straight frowns no daps strapped three times
that tec11 ak47 one beretta
ready for whatever tell them pussy niggas come together
heavy better nigga supersoaker wet a nigga
six feet under flowers you aint nothin but a petal nigga
im just a little nigga tryin to be a civil nigga
thirty years old shit thatll be a given nigga
quit it wayne your mom is listenin
but she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
them niggas trippin until the shots whistlin
hear them bullets hissin like a cobra at attention
i got a bitch and quit callin women bitches
as long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
no preventin the grind i gotta get it
im admitted to the game true player no quittin
there you go shittin on the way a nigga thinkin
only history i know is benjamin franklin
and since the future aint promised to no one
i live every day like this is the sure one
trade in the tidal wave this is the ocean
stand in that heat til the motherfucking snow come
and it feels so fuckin good
throw my dope like a rope let em tug and pull
no hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
come and get it automatics in motion
we bangin for the bread nigga even the molded
i got my loaf i got my toast
chaperone of the south i got my coast
yeah and until i die
im the thethe thethe the best rapper alivesee lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also like17embed"
