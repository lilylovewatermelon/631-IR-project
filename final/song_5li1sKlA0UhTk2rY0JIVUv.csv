small simple safe price
rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets
this is not a small cut that scabs and dries and flakes and heals
and i am not afraid to die
im not afraid to bleed and fuck and fight
i want the pain of payment
whats left but a section of pygmysize cuts
much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks
would you be my little cut
would you be my thousand fucks
and make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid
to fill and spill over and under my thoughts
my sad sorry selfish cry out to the cutter
im cutting trying to picture your black broken heart
love is not like anything
especially a fucking knife

verse 1
look at me you can tell
by the way i move and do my hair
do you think that its me or its not me
i dont even care
im alive i dont smell
im the cleanest i have ever been
i feel big i feel tall i feel dry
dry

verse 2
do i drink do i date
ive got perfect placement
all my ink satisfied in your eyes
im the biggest fan ive got right now

bridge
my stomach hurts now
and all tied off in lace
i pray i beg for anything
to hit me in the face
and this sickness isnt me
and i pray to fall from grace
the last thing i see is feeling
and im telling you im a fake
im telling you im a fake
im telling you im a fake
im telling you im a fake
