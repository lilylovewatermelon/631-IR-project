verse 1 prince of tides
my life is a movie but i bought the tickets too late
missing the show refund me they wont
so now i make pay selling it as single frames
telling myself that its bank
but deep down i know its just change
one day the seats will be empty
and one day the screen will be blank
until that day please dont tempt me
cause im gonna try and stay straight
vacant apologies hollow the blame
my sorrow is comforting and im in pain
ill follow whats numbing but there ill remain
but there ill remain
call it what you want but dont call it what it aint

dont wanna talk about my drug use suffered through so much abuse
lost my way back home left my family all alone
did what i would never do and cant forgive myself
what i put my father through left him to burn in hell yeah
my brother hugged me with tears in his eyes pointed to his veins
tryna indicate that the blood we share is both the same
man i swear i died that day amends that i try to make
wrote this for the words i could not find to say19embed"
