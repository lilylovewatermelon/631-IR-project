verse 1 christina aguilera
so what am i not sposed to have an opinion
should i keep quiet just because im a woman
call me a bitch cause i speak whats on my mind
guess its easier for you to swallow if i sat and smiled
when a female fires back
suddenly big talker dont know how to act
so he does what any little boy would do
makin up a few false rumors or two
that for sure is not a man to me
slanderin names for popularity
its sad you only get your fame through controversy its so sad
but now its time for me to come and give you more to say

chorus christina aguilera
this is for my girls all around the world around the world
whove come across a man that dont respect your worth whoa
thinkin all women should be seen not heard whoa
so what do we do girls shout louder
lettin em know were gonna stand our ground stand our ground
lift your hands high and wave em proud whoa
take a deep breath and say it loud whoa
never can never will cant hold us down

verse 2 christina aguilera
so what am i not sposed to say what im sayin
are you offended with the message im bringin
call me whatever cause your words dont mean a thing
guess you aint even a man enough to handle what i sing
if you look back in history
its a common double standard of society
the guy gets all the glory the more he can score
while the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
i dont understand why its okay
the guy can get away with it the girl gets named
all my ladies come together and make a change
and start a new beginning for us everybody sing

chorus christina aguilera  lil kim

we standin our ground on this one
lift your hands high and wave em proud whoa
take a deep breath and say it loud
never can never will cant hold us down check it
verse 3 lil kim
heres something i just cant understand
if a guy have three girls then hes the man
he can even give her some head then sex her raw
if a girl do the same then shes a whore
but the tables bout to turn i bet my fame on it
cats take my ideas and put they name on it
its alright though you cant hold me down
i got to keep on movin
to all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
do it right back to him and let that be that
you need to let him know that his game is whack
