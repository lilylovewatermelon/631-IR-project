are you a shy boy

verse 1
were in the door i get a smile from a fly boy
hes seen me before and makes his move like a fly boy
im sick and tired of them fly boys
its bye bye boy
im in the lounge i get a wink from a bad boy
he comes around all puffed up like a bad boy
im sick and tired of them bad boys

chorus
cause i got my eye on this other guy
back in the booth with his boys hes all mellowed out
and tonight i dont mind me a shy boy so i gotta know
are you a shy boy shy boy shy boy

verse 2
im by the stage i get a look from a rock boy
hes got the shades on indoors like a rock boy
im sick and tired of them rock boys
its bye bye boy
out on the floor i get the moves from a homeboy
tryin to score his body rocks like a homeboy
im sick and tired of them homeboys
