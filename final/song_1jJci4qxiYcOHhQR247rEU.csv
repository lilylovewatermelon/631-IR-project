five four three two one ah

verse 1
you were a child crawlin on your knees toward it
makin mama so proud but your voice is too loud
we like to watch you laughin
you pick the insects off plants no time to think of consequences

chorus
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted

verse 2
the water is warm but its sendin me shivers
a baby is born cryin out for attention
the memories fade like lookin through a fogged mirror
decision to decisions are made and not bought
but i thought this wouldnt hurt a lot i guess not

chorus
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanted to be haunted
control yourself take only what you need from it
a family of trees74embed"
