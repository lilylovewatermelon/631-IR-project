i bear lots of animosity to bell hops
they never bring my luggage up on time
and taxi drivers really tax my patience
if they vanished would it really be a crime

verse 2 doofenshmirtz
i dont like meter maids or underwater welders
health fanatic cooks or camera crews
not fond of monks or yoga teachers or sports fans in the bleachers
and im not sure how im feeling about you

interlude doofenshmirtz
there are lots of horrid people on this planet
that i would love to give a lashing to

chorus doofenshmirtz
but my goody twoshoes brother
the favorite of my mother
is the one i want to smother
in a ton of pigeon goo

outro doofenshmirtz
yes my goodytwo shoes brother
the favorite of my mother
hes the one i want to smother
thank you sir ill have another
hes the one i want to smother
in a ton of pigeon goo
you might also likeyou see you see how i held that last note good huhembed"
