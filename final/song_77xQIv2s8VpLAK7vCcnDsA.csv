i learned a lot about the way of things
i learned that everything the wind the leaves has breath inside
they were pointing ever east
to see the everturning aeon cease
their wills were ever bent on waiting with all their might

i know i know
i know this
there is beauty in the way of things

there beyond the palisade
i saw the morning lead a cavalcade
they made a marvel of a display
and it made me cry o lai

o lai o lai
o lai lord
