i think i know what you mean but watch what you say
cause theyll be trying to knock you down in some way
sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
how do you wake someone up from inside a dream
your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
your body followed this feeling like following light
once that your music was born it followed you round
and then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud

prechorus
youre sad but you smile its not in your eyes
your eyeballs dont change its the muscles around your eyes

chorus 1
an egg to fertilize
a pulse to stabilize
a body to deodorize
a life to scrutinize
a child to criticize
young adults to modernize
citizens to terrorize
generations to desensitize

verse 2
your dreams are sweet and obsessed and youre overworked
youre over taken by visions of being overlooked
how disappointed would didipp be
to see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed
am i a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live
as free and detached as boats to the dock
just like the music was born and detached from your heart
is your free time to free minds or for falling apart
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeprechorus
night after night you turn off the light
you dont fall asleep right away are we are we done

chorus 2
a desk to organize
a product to advertise
a market to monopolize
movie stars to idolize
leaders to scandalize
enemies to neutralize
no time to apologize
fury to tranquilize
weapons to synchronize
cities to vaporiâ€“23embed"
