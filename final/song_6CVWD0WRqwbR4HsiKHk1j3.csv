thought i ran into you down on the street
then it turned out to only be a dream

chorus
i made a point to burn all of the photographs
she went away and then i took a different path
i remember the face but i cant recall the name
now i wonder how whatsername has been

verse 2
seems that she disappeared without a trace
did she ever marry ol whatshisface

chorus
i made a point to burn all of the photographs
she went away and then i took a different path
i remember the face but i cant recall the name
now i wonder how whatsername has been
guitar solo

breakdown
remember whatever
it seems like forever ago
remember whatever
it seems like forever ago
remember whatever
the regrets are useless in my mind
it seems like forever ago
shes in my head i must confess
remember whatever
the regrets are useless in my mind
it seems like forever ago
shes in my head so long ago
go go go go
go go go go go

and in the darkest night
if my memory serves me right
ill never turn back time
forgetting you but not the time35embed"
