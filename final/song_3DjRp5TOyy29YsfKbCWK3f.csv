another day in this carnival of souls
another night settles in as quickly as it goes
the memories of shadows ink on the page
and i cant seem to find my way home

chorus
and its almost like
your heavens trying everything
your heavens trying everything to keep me out

verse 2
all the places ive been and things ive seen
a million stories that made up a million shattered dreams
the faces of people ill never see again
and i cant seem to find my way home

chorus
cause its almost like
your heavens trying everything
to break me down
cause its almost like
your heavens trying everything
to keep me out

chorus
cause its almost like
your heavens trying everything
to break me down
cause its almost like
your heavens trying everything
your heavens trying everything to break me down
to break me down
