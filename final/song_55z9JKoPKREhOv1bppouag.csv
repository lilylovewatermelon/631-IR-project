so congratulations long break a leg tonight
what a shame i heard the understudy died under the knife
crying backwards under bedroom lights
the operation congratulations

chorus
i dont think youll ever want to love me
youd better listen to your doctor doctor

verse 2
sober up and bury the empty cup
in a backyard of seattle we used to lie
when i sew you up
dont let me stop bleeding
tiny stitches that you placed into my skin
wont let me go oh no oh no
and theyre ruining the mood
so ill toast every beat of my heart like a miracle

chorus
and i dont think youll ever want to love me
youd better listen to your doctor
doctors lie lie lie if the dollar is right
oh my sweet little girl hold your mouth and youll be alright
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
gather round gather round
ladies and gentlemen come from far come from wide
the moment youve all been waiting for
tonight join us as we explore the spinechilling mystery of death
and the miracle of resurrection
please understand me when id rather see you dead
than live without me so thirsty for more

verse 3
beyond the sea blue light i met the love of my life
shed rather see me dead than face me
i like your starry eyes they yell surprise surprise
im in love but not for long
our operation call off the operation
our operation call off off off

outro
another wave has turned its back on me
crashed back on the eyes of the first i see
cant count on anything if your delicate eyes dont blink someday
for you id count the salt under the sea they might as well be gone
might as well be gone8embed"
