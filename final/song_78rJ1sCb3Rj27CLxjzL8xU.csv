you cant put a nigga on if youre too famous too famous
or give advice and say whats right then get too angry argh
tryna read my right with the red blue light like we still in slavery whoop whoop
plug got jammed up so the bando dried up lookin like raisins dry
another day we tryna get by
we goin through phases tryna get by
pull up in whips they saw in they dreams
man look at they faces skrt skrt
i stopped and got fast food for my teacher
he said i wouldnt make it hi
but aint got no bad heart
so i saw him said congratulations bye
why do what he want me to do
when im in the position i made it now why would i do that
im from the nawf smoked so much cookie in la
feel like i got traded feel like im traded
im goin through phases
only want bands they calling me braces calling me braces
wanna learn gotta have patience
