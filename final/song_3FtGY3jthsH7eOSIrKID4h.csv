well i miss my mother and i miss being her son
as crazy as i was i guess i wasnt much of one
sometimes i miss her so much i want to hop on the next jet
and i get lonely but i aint that lonely yet

chorus 1
and i love my sister lord knows how ive missed her
she loves me and she knows i wont forget
and sometimes i get jealous of all her little pets
and i get lonely but i aint that lonely yet

verse 2
i roll over in bed lookin for someone to touch
theres a girl that i know of but dont ask for much
shes homely and shes cranky and her hairs in a net
and im lonely but i aint that lonely yet

chorus 2
are you my friend when i need one i need someone to be one
i take anybody i can get
sometimes i wanna call you and i feel like a pest
and im lonely but i aint that lonely yet

verse 3
i went down to the river filled with regret
i looked down and i wondered if there was any reason left
i left just before my lungs could get wet
im lonely but i aint that lonely yet
