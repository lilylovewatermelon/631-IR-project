blown
im so blown
im so blown
im so blown
im so—

verse
pulled up to the outing
and we off the loud
feelin good looking good
they said they fuck with my style
i kinda smiled sat on the couch
and then i pulled out my phone
see a text from my mom
asking when will i be home where you at nigga
prolly three i dont know
that shit is always unknown
i heard a girl just said excuse me boy i like your cologne ralph lauren
probably thinks you tryna smash
im tryna get you alone
you know im kidding would have said it
but was just too blown

chorus
blown
im so blown
im so blown
im so blown
im so—you might also like5embed"
