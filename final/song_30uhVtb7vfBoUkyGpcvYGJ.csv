i want to roll the numbers
i want to feel my stars align again
even if the earth breaks like burnt skin
and the heavens just wont open up for me
would you invite me in again
wont you pay for your arrogance
wont you show me your weakness

chorus
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i cant win
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i cant win
so lets play

verse 2
and somewhere
somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
im still your favourite regret
youre still my weapon of choosing
and out there
stuck in a quantum pattern
tangled with what i never said
you say it doesnt matter
i want to be forgiven
i want to choke up chunks of my own sins
even if the sky cracks in mourning
and the heavens just wont open up for me
would you invite me in again
let me pay for my arrogance
wont you show me your weakness

i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i cant win
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i made loving you a blood sport
i cant win

outro
and somewhere
somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
im still your favourite regret
youre still my weapon of choosing
and out there
stuck in a quantum pattern
tangled with what i never said
