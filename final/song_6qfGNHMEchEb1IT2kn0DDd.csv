ever since you left me
ive been trying to hide the pain
painting on a smile with lipstick
putting on a big charade
so difficult to keep pretending
its getting harder everyday
its plain to see im cold and heartsick
since you turned and walked away

prechorus
i just keep going round and round
and round in circles
keep on tumbling down

chorus
oh boy my world has changed
and i dont think i can make it without you
nothings the same
you got me running around in circles over you
running around in circles over you

verse 2
saturday i saw you
holding hands with someone new
somehow i kept my composure
just like everything was cool
but inside i kept repeating
dont you let them see you cry
so i casually turned my head
as the tears rolled down my eyes
see mariah carey liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likeprechorus
i just keep going round and round
and round in circles
keep on tumbling down

chorus
oh boy my world has changed
and i dont think i can make it without you
nothings the same
you got me running around in circles over you

bridge
everything is you
how can i pull through
my heart is consumed im so confused
still caught up in you love can be so cruel
baby dont know how to turn you loose

chorus
oh boy my world has changed
and i dont think i can make it without you
no nothings the same
you got me running around
and running around
and running around
nothings the same
baby baby cause you
got me running around in circles over you
running around in circles over you
yeah yeah yeah2embed"
