well she said she didnt love me
and kicked me out the door
now im livin in one room
and sleepin on the floor

prechorus 1
i think im gonna kick my boots off
and put some music on
and since im all alone
i might as well get stoned

chorus 1
i might as well get stoned
and get it off my mind
aint got a thing to do
all ive got is time
the bottles all ive had
to be a friend of mine
and since my whiskeys gone
i might as well get stoned

verse 2
every time i watch the tv
another soldier dies
another brothers gone
another mother cries

now i know theyve got a job to do
but if i had one wish
i wish theyd all come home
so we could all get stoned

chorus 2
i might as well get stoned
and get it off my mind
aint got shit to do
all ive got is time
the bottles all ive had
to be a friend of mine
and since my whiskeys gone
i might as well get stoned

outro
might as well get stoned
oh might as well get stoned
might as well get stonedembed"
