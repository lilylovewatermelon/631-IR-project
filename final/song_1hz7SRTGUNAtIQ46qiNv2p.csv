verse 1 tyler the creator
comparing scars before dinner
jump off the roof into the mirror
felt like summer to my december
was it my august shit i dont remember
two three go
i know my temperature was set
you finally flew south
the bird gon leave the nest youre so chromatic
at least i had it uh
instead of never
or maybe im too dramatic
two three go

chorus ceelo green
whether its rain or shine i know im fine for now
my loves gone my loves gone
my loves gone oh gone
two three go
or maybe its just a dream that i cant seem to wake up from
my loves gone my loves gone
my loves gone gone

i know love is is all i got
i just hope to god she got good taste
could put you on some shit you never seen
could play a couple songs that you could dance to
i hope you know she cant compete with me

chorus ceelo green
whether its rain or shine i know im fine for now
my loves gone my loves gone
my loves gone oh gone
or maybe its just a dream that i cant seem to wake up from
my loves gone my loves gone
my loves gone oh gone

verse 3 tyler the creator
my love is gone
ayo its poison in that gumbo
emotion feel dumbo
ask me where my love go
that bitch walked outside the front door
my love is gone
knock knock knock knock
im not shocked i brought this on me
its my fault you gon leave
lesson taught see
the weatherman told me it wasnt rainin
my stupid ass brought umbrellas
i got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
now its 90 degrees and all the tricks up my sleeve
is drenched in sweat and delusion because i jet to conclusions
you got your thing i got nothing but memories
i know your secrets nigga yeah
im not bitter or nothing i understand that
everybody making a choice according to plan and
we had two different blueprints but understood influence
you opened up early on i thought i had a permit
you started buildin a bridge and turned it into a fence
then my buildin got tore down all because of your new tenant
ill just buy up some new shit never down with a lease
you never lived in your truth im just happy i lived in it
but i finally found peace so peace
want me do it over everything
outro jerrod carmichael
i hate wasted potential that shit crushes your spirit
it really does it crushes your soul
part ii thank you
