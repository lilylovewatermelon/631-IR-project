i said grandpa whats this picture here
its all black and white and it aint real clear
is that you there he said “yeah i was eleven”
“and times were tough back in thirtyfive
thats me and uncle joe just tryna to survive
a cotton farm in a great depression”

refrain
if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
you should’ve seen it in color

verse 2
oh and this one here’s taken overseas
in the middle of hell in nineteen fortythree
in the wintertime you can almost see my breath
that was my tail gunner ol johnny mcgee
he was a high school teacher from new orleans
and he had my back right through the day we left

chorus
if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
you should’ve seen it in color
a pictures worth a thousand words
but you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
you shouldve seen it in color
you might also likeverse 3
this one is my favorite one
this is me and grandma in the summer sun
all dressed up the day we said our vows
you cant tell it here but it was hot that june
and that rose was red and her eyes were blue
and just look at that smile i was so proud

bridge
thats the story of my life
right there in black and white

chorus
and if it looks like we were scared to death
like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
you should’ve seen it in color
yeah a pictures worth a thousand words
but you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
you should’ve seen it in color

outro
should’ve seen it in color
yeah a pictures worth a thousand words
but you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
you should’ve seen it in color7embed"
