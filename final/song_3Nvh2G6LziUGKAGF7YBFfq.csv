did you ever have one of those days
when it just rains and it rains
your mind and your whole back aches
but you get up anyway
you gave up your dreams
youve got a boss to please
it makes you wonder if its worth it
loosen my chain
cause even my pain is hurtin

chorus
well i said lord wont you give an ol boy a break
said youd never give me more than i could take
well this old world will sure rattle your faith sometimes
well you try and you try and you keep on trying
happys for sale but you cant buy it
how bout a little something to ease a mans burden
cause even my pain is hurtin

verse 2
my house aint worth what i owe
ive been all my life hoeing that row
and like a sucker i bought what they sold
but that there in the ground aint gold
yeah ive been a caged bird singing
waiting on freedom
feeling like my prayers aint working
go on and loosen my chain
cause even my pain is hurtin

so i said lord wont you give an ol boy a break
said youd never give me more than i could take
well this old world can sure rattle your faith sometimes
well you try and you try and you keep on trying
happys for sale but you cant buy it
how bout a little something to ease a mans burden
cause even my pain is hurtin

bridge
ive got a loaded 45
laying on the table
next to a bottle of ol black label
cant be the only way
to ease a mans burden

chorus
so i said lord cant you give an ol boy a break
you said you wont give me more than i could take
well this old world can sure rattle your faith sometimes
yeah cause i try and i try and i keep on trying
happys for sale but i just cant buy it
how bout a little something to ease a mans burden
cause even my pain is hurtin

outro
i said now even my pain
even my pain
said even my pain is hurtinembed"
