over and over and over again
the tide carries
i give up my water and watch you sink in
oh the levy

prechorus
at night when the coastline
breaks
you hide in the fallen
waves

chorus
on the rise and the sights of typhoon red and blue
washing by
and the rise falling in too we fall through
holding tight

and the dull effects of your suitcase
are casting again

verse 2
over and over and over again
oh the sun oh the sun
i give her my water and watch you sink in
oh mama oh mama

at night when the coastline
breaks
you hide in the fallen
waves

chorus
on the rise and the sights of typhoon red and blue
washing by
and the rise falling in too we fall through
holding tight

and the dull effects of your suitcase
are casting again

on the rise and the sights of typhoon

chorus
on the rise and the sights of typhoon red and blue
washing by
and the rise falling in too we fall through
holding tight
and the dull effects of your suitcase
are casting againembed"
