stuck in my ways i know it kinda sucks
wastin all this time and trust
diamonds in the rough that had the toughest luck at findin love

verse 2 jid
jugglin pain and strugglin problems
lookin for danger duckin and dodgin
i got the banger and not a small one
niggas be changin like a revolver

i could applaud ya fuck all the fame and fuck all the dollars mane
what were they talkin im ashamed

she said that my head too hard
i tried to be good but nah
im leavin it up to god
squeezin the gratata
oh my did i go too far too far too far

outro
you cant change the only thing you wanna change is the motherfuckin beats
lets have a word we can talk about that shit

my baby daddy pissed me off today
so we could talk about this nigga zero accountability
want a bad bitch but its too much responsibility
part ii

intro
yo yo yo yo yo uh look uh

verse
a nigga wanna change tryin hard as i can
but its hard to try to redesign the nature of man
dnd she in my dm for my dna strands
aint fall for the scam
then again im fightin off all the thoughts in my pants
pretty broads ménages spend a fall out in france
in the stars on the ocean in a boat or the sand
dont you lie to me do me like you delilah and samson
i can change you aint even really give me a chance nigga i gave your ass one million two million three million fuckin chances
look save the narrative you savin it for marriage
im flyin back from paris i can text you in the air
remember when we met and you said that you love the fade but i should grow my hair
ex man was banned couldnt grow a pair
then you start fuckin with the mrs not the messieurs
life is love love is really life as long as its pure
i aint speakin of genders you could follow agendas
i aint tryna be the guy thats gon make you cry me a river
like im justin timber timberlake or timbaland im controllin my temper
good before i turn into a timber wolf
in the woods you my little red ridin hood
thought you was hidin how you feelin its kinda obvious
on a connectin flight to atlanta leavin laguardia
arguin over anonymous women now we got the audience fuck
outro
dont play with me raise your coin
come pick up your kids and go home to your bitch
the one that you could the one that you could play with period
not this one ha for real
shady shady boots
ha ha what mike epps say stop callin here you fuckin up my family
its a real nigga who will ha its a real nigga who will
and thats on marys first lamb hahaha2embed"
