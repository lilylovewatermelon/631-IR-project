im just trying to be a father
raise a daughter and a son
be a lover to their mother
everything to everyone
up and at them bright and early
im all business in my suit
yeah im dressed for success
from my head down to my boots

verse 2
i dont do it for money theres still bills that i cant pay
i dont do it for the glory i just do it anyway
providing for our futures my responsibility
yeah im real good under pressure being all that i can be
and i cant call in sick on mondays
when the weekends been to strong
i just work straight through the holidays
and sometimes all night long

verse 3
you can bet that i stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
hey im solid hey im steady hey im true down to the core
and i will always do my duty no matter what the price
ive counted up the cost i know the sacrifice
oh and i dont want to die for you
but if dyings asked of me
ill bear that cross with honor
cause freedom dont come free
