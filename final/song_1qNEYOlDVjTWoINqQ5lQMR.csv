my cup the devil brandnew bezel wheezy outta here
plain jane i feel special
fuck officials finish steppin
i know thats gon make it better
these niggas just talk like killers
allout war with my hitters
i think somethin we step on shit
its all about what i figure

verse 1
i aint take nothin off fore i take somethin back ima put one in
when that drank came in my cup turned darker then my lens
who gon protect me im the protector of all my friends
how the fuck you with me you playin detective you aint my twin
ima flood you a bag soon as that pack get dropped right in
wanna take that bentley back because that gt aint the same

chorus
we miss gon double back to make sure bro blow out the brain
i dont want you neither or your friend yall dont understand the pain
of the life of a slime mind on the grind i cant waste my time
cause now im up and they know it
aint gotta picture me rollin
cause when they see me its on me
it could turn out bad or turn out good
but im still thuggin throwin up my hood
you might also likeverse 2
and whenever that we meet we gon slide them
leave homicide to find them
still aint got my mind made up
mask up before we blind him
keep actin like he five and im gon dime him
ten after ten must i remind him
who gon supply me im the supplier of all my friends
with you to the end who gon have my back when im locked in the pen
he was on that cocky shit i already had one cocked in
devil inside my cup i let that drink become my friend

refrain
my cup the devil brandnew bezel
plain jane i feel special
fuck officials finish steppin
i know thats gon make it better
these niggas just talk like killers
allout war with my hitters
i think somethin we step on shit
its all about what i figure

chorus
we miss gon double back to make sure bro blow out the brain
i dont want you neither or your friend yall dont understand the pain
of the life of a slime mind on the grind i cant waste my time
cause now im up and they know it
aint gotta picture me rollin
cause when they see me its on me
it could turn out bad or turn out good
but im still thuggin throwin up my hood
outro
and whenever that we meet we gon slide them
mask up before we blind him5embed"
