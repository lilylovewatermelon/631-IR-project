yellow lines in the dead of the night
oh i was heading back out west
trying to keep my eyes open wide
id gone days without any rest
saw him lying in the road looking bad
about 20 yards ahead
you come back from a trip to the east
but you dont come back from the dead

verse 2
sure as hell he was dead as they come
and he was already starting to smell
just a kid with his hair slicked back
and a knife tucked into his belt
was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
that never felt like his
though i was worn and weary i thought id bury him
and lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

verse 3
i laid him down in a grave in the sand
and he grabbed my arm with his dead mans hand
he said i know im dead but i dont wanna lie
in a grave out here where the coyotes cry
i stared right into the endless void
and i aint going back if i got any choice
i know how to live i dont know how to die
and there aint no thrills in the afterlife

so lift me up out of here my friend
and ill wander the night till the ages end
lit by the moon he walked through the sand
and he waved goodbye with his dead mans hand

and he will roam forever haunting the desert
