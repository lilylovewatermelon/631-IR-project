i had a vision tonight that the world was ending
yeah the sky was falling and time was bending
i watched the heavens collide right before my eyes

chorus
what if the world dies with the sunrise
baby its all right well be up all night
what if were unmade when the stars fade
keep me going till the night turns into the day

verse 2
i had a visitor come from the great beyond
and telling me our time in the world is done
and to watch for a sign in the midnight sky

chorus
what if the world dies with the sunrise
baby its all right well be up all night
what if were unmade when the stars fade
keep me going till the night turns into the day
what if the world dies with the sunrise
baby its all right well be up all night
what if were unmade when the stars fade
keep me going till the night turns into the day
