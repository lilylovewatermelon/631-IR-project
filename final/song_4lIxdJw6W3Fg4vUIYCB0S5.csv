midnight
you come and pick me up no headlights
a long drive
could end in burning flames or paradise
fade into view oh
its been a while since i have even heard from you
heard from you

prechorus
and i should just tell you to leave cause i
know exactly where it leads but i
watch us go round and round each time

chorus
you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
you got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashing down we come back every time
cause we never go out of style we never go out of style

verse 2
