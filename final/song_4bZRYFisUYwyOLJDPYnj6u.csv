es muy importante a usar su mente
so let go of all your preconcieved notions
get up on your feet and put your body in motion
cause back home we love to dance
we could be twostepin or ravin to trance
and when the party is crunk the girls back it up
we got the systems in the cars and the 20s on the trucks
6 foot four with a cowboy hat
