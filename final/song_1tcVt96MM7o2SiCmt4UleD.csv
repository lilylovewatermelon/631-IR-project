buddies roll up in the morning and hand you a coffee
tell ya hurry up the fish aint gonna wait on you
buddies dont give you no warning
when they shoot up a stop sign out on some old county road

chorus
ive got ones that ive fought with and outrun the law with

they work hard for their money their boots all stay muddy
all my beer drinking deer dragging dusty dirt road riding buddies
