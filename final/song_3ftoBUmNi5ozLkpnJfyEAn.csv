suns getting heavy and the night is falling
phone ringing its a good time calling
old truck slicked up shining like a rhinestone

bridge
taking off like a big red pocket
flying high by the time the band comes on

verse 1
im loaded got a fist full of cash
im rolling just filled her up with cash
im going where i wanna be
i got my baby beside me
shes strolling and i like it a lot
shes showing everything shes got
were blowing these twenty dollar bills
i cant tell ya how good i feel
im loaded

verse 2
my babys got her shoes off out on the dance floor
gonna dance til she cant dance anymore
they havent played give me three steps
give me three steps yet
