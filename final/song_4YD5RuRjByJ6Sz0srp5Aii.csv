you pull my strings and push my soul
you fool my heart with every note
you drop a beat and kiss my face
you make me move then cut the bass

prechorus
and you work so hard to get me just to let me go
yeah you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show
and you try to take me home like youre dimaggio
oh its such a joke

chorus
why are you singing me love songs
what good is a love song
what good is a love song without the love
why are you singing me love songs
what good is a love song
what good is a love song without the love
why are we acting like lovers
we dont know each other
even though we used to rule the world
why are you singing me love songs
what good is a love song a love song without the love

verse 2
youre so confused its getting old
you wear your ring but leave me cold
youre beautiful but cause me pain
you played my heart like its a game

this is the bend before the break
when we forget the harmony
this is how water colors fade
into distant memories
