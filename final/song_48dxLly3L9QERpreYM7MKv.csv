verse 1 tyler
who the fuck invited mr i dont give a fuck
who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks i did
well you fucking up and truthfully i had enough
and fuck rolling papers im a rebel bitch im ashing blunts sorry
full of shit like i ate that john
come on kids fuck that class and hit that bong
lets buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
with nice homes 401ks and nice ass lawns
those privileged fucks got to learn that we aint taking no shit
like ellen degeneres clitoris is playing with dick
im jealous as shit cause i aint got no home meal to come to
so if you do im throwing fingers out screaming fuck you
i got ten of these kennedys
not dom but if i was a dahm i would be jeffery
preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
im fucking bout it bout it like im master p in 96
its fucking immaculate the way your daughter smacking dicks
surprised she hasnt taken gymnastic dick inside her alleyoop
the golf wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
and showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
im going harder than a midget jumping over me
chronic youth im shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
