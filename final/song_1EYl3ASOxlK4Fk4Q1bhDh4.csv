1EYl3ASOxlK4Fk4Q1bhDh4,The One on the Right Is on the Left,Johnny Cash,4E2eUhFHqTG2pu9MN1NDIF,"7 contributorsthe one on the right is on the left lyricsthere once was a musical troupe
a picking singing folk group
they sang the mountain ballads
and the folk songs of our land
they were long on musical ability
folks thought they would go far
but political incompatibility led to their downfall

well the one on the right was on the left
and the one in the middle was on the right
and the one on the left was in the middle
and the guy in the rear was a methodist

this musical aggregation toured the entire nation
singing the traditional ballads
and the folk songs of our land
they performed with great virtuosity
and soon they were the rage
but political animosity prevailed upon the stage

well the one on the right was on the left
and the one in the middle was on the right
and the one on the left was in the middle
and the guy in the rear burned his drivers license

well the curtain had ascended
a hush fell on the crowd
as thousands there were gathered
to hear the folk songs of our land
but they took their politics seriously
and that night at the concert hall
as the audience watched deliriously
they had a freeforall

and the one in the middle was on the top
and the one on the left got a broken arm
and the guy in the rear said oh dear

now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
dont go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
just work on harmony and diction
play your banjo well
and if you have political convictions
keep them to yourself
now the one on the left works in a bank
and the one in the middle drives a truck
the one on the rights an allnight deejay
and the guy in the rear got drafted1embed"
