verse 1
those high heels with that sun dress
turquoise heart hanging round your neck
red lips like wine wanna to drink em up
and keep on drinking til you make me drunk
tiedup hair wanna let it down
and just let the rest fall to the ground
you take beautiful to the max
cant help myself when you look like that

chorus
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer girl the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer love the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you

verse 2
theres a million stars dancing in the sky
a pictureperfect moon so bright
but i dont care im looking at you
from where i stand you cant beat the view

come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer girl the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer love the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you

my eyes have seen
some amazing things
but girl my eyes aint seen
nothing quite like you hey baby

chorus
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer girl the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer love the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you
come a little closer come a little closer
come a little closer love the way you look tonight
my eyes are the only thing i dont wanna take off of you7embed"
