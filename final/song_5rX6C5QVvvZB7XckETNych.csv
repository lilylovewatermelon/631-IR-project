it was 1989 my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was seventeen and she was far from inbetween
it was summertime in northern michigan
ah ah ah
ah ah ah

verse 1
splashing through the sand bar
talking by the campfire
its the simple things in life like when and where
we didnt have no internet
but man i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair

hook
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

verse 2
catching walleye from the dock
watching the waves roll off the rocks
shell forever hold a spot inside my soul
wed blister in the sun
we couldnt wait for night to come
to hit that sand and play some rock and roll
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likehook
while we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

sweet home alabama oh yeah
turn it up

verse 3
now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
or how we thought those days would never end
sometimes ill hear that song and ill start to sing along
and think man id love to see that girl again
man id love to see that girl again yeah

hook
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
outro
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
ah ah ah
ah ah ah
