first cool snap of fall in the air
we been waitin on it all damn year
drag out a carhartt and a chair
lets build a fire
shoulder pads crackin on a high school field
openin day is on our heels
god i love how friday night feels
lets build a fire

chorus
lets build a fire lets crank it on up
pour a little diesel in my cup
im finna toss it on yall better back up
lets build a fire
you cant burn it down in the neighborhood
but its all good back in the backwoods
let the good time just transpire
lets build a fire

verse 2
we been talkin bout it since july
temp done dropped down to fortyfive
think its time we take it higher
lets build a fire
comе a little closer if you can
put your little hеart in my hand
turn me on like an amplifier
lets build a fire

you cant burn it down in the neighborhood

lets build a fire

chorus

pour a little diesel in a sonic cup
im finna toss it on yall better back up yall better back up
you cant burn it down in the neighborhood
but its all good back in the backwoods
