verse 1
strut on by like a king
telling everybody they know nothing
and longlived what you thought you were
time aint on your side anymore anymore

chorus 1
and so you tell me i cant take my chances
but ive told you one too many times
and you were cryin like a bitch

verse 2
im tougher than nails i can promise you that
step outta line and youll get bitchslapped back
and you can run your little mouth all day
but the hand of god just smacked you back into yesterday

chorus 2
and so you tell me i cant take my chances
but ive told you one too many times
and you were cryin like a bitch
and you wonder why no one can stand you
theres no denying you were cryin like a bitch
you were cryin like a bitch
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likebridge
blinded by your sacred faded past times
only time is your enemy
granted a second chance
to prove that your arrogance
is stronger than youll ever be
its stronger than you can be

oh stronger than you can be
oh stronger than you can
be

outro
and so you tell me i cant take my chances
but ive told you one too many times
and you were cryin like a bitch
and you wonder why no one can stand you
theres no denyin you were cryin like a bitch

you were cryin like a bitch
you were cryin like a bitch
you were cryin like a bitch
oh bitch4embed"
