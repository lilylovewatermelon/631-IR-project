i heard a song about a rambling man
bought a guitar and i started a band
i got a gig at the local am vet
i was gone and i aint back yet

69 bored out and jacked up
a quarter mile that was all it was
i burned the cool off of that corvette
and i was gone and i aint back yet

chorus
looking back at the moments black and white
i wouldnt change a thing that changed my life
for the worse for the better
man i was gone gone forever

verse 2
she was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
man we were matches and gasoline
first taste of love never will forget
i was gone and i aint back yet
i was gone gone and i aint back yet

chorus
looking back at the moments black white
i wouldnt change a thing that changed my life
for the worse for the better
man i was gone gone forever
the laughs the smiles the trials the tears
its hard to hate what got me here
what got me here
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
she was a straight out of hollywood smile
we missed it all by a country mile
went out one night for some cigarettes
and i was gone and i aint back yet

hook
i was gone gone and i aint back yet
i was gone and i aint back aint back aint back
and i was gone and i aint back yet
i was gone and i aint back yet
i was gone and i aint back yetembed"
