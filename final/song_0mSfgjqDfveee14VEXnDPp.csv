is there anything that can make you happy
i dont know what to say to make it better
seeing you like this down and hurt so badly
when you have been so kept together

prechorus
whats this
all this time i thought you didnt need me
now ive gone from you and now you tell me

chorus
youre in love but thats not what it was
all those times that passed by with no signs
and now youre telling me
you miss me boy why couldnt i see
and my heart dont agree with what youre telling me

verse 2
you were nonchalant strong and unaffected
and you never wanted me to be there
i never saw your heart thats how close you kept it
so right now im so unsure how to care

prechorus
whats this
all this time i thought you didnt need me
