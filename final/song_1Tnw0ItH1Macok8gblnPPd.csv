only holdin up i do is my end of the bargain
only beggin that i do is me beggin your pardon
only tryin that i do is me tryin the hardest
only problems i do are math problems with profit
only lyin i do is lyin out in the tropics
only cryin i do is cryin from laughin bout it
only lackin i can do is my lack of responses
only rest that i do is where the rest of my commas
still i rise maya angelou vibes
when life comin at you from all angles and sides
and they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside
it really boils down to how you plan to survive
love certain ones but never get attached to em
give em nice things but whats that to em
especially when another girl i flew in is flickin up in my bathroom
and they recognize the bathroom
all hell starts to break loose in my texts
i only tell lies to who i gotta protect
i would rather have you remember me how we met
i would rather lose my leg than lose they respect
but thatll never happen the way im watchin my step
that aint what im bout
im in control of my destiny never in doubt
if i cant make it with you ill make it without
they say take the good with the bad ill take it without
houston women i wineanddine and take to the house
my moral compass is janky it breaks in the south
is there more to life than digits and bankin accounts
is there more to life than sayin i figured it out
is there more yeah
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 drake
sweeter the berry the blacker the juice
the boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth
too many lyrics bout houses and loot
too many walt disney characters mouses and goofs
i mean you know i love a challenge but challenged by who
ill let you bring a thousand recruits
my peers are a talented group
but even if you take all they statistics and carry the two
even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
theres still nothin they could really do
its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due
whenever its time to recoup
yeah soon as this album drop im out of the deal
in the house playin dangelo how does it feel
i got a fear of havin things on my mind when i die
what you got time on your hands or time on your side
is there any sense in doin these songs when im high
is there more to life than goin on trips to dubai
yachts on the 4th of july g5 soarin the skies
is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
and all of these fortunate times
and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size
am i missin somethin thats more important to find
like healin my soul like family time
is there more to life than just when im feelin alive
is there more
outro nai palm
passion instant
sweat beads feel me feel me
cupids shot me
my heartbeats racing my heartbeats racing
tempt me drive me tempt me
it feels so exciting
thought of highly highly
its yours entirely
ill be ill be more than a lover
more than a woman
more than a lover for you16embed"
