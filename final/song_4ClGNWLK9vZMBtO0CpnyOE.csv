i mustve dreamed a thousand dreams
been haunted by a million screams
but i can hear the marching feet
theyre moving into the street
now did you read the news today
they say the dangers gone away
but i can see the fires still alight
there burning into the night

prechorus
theres too many men
too many people
making too many problems
and theres not much love to go ‘round
cant you see
this is a land of confusion

chorus
this is the world we live in
and these are the hands were given
use them and lets start trying
to make it a place worth living in

verse 2
ooh superman where are you now
when everythings gone wrong somehow
the men of steel the men of power
are losing control by the hour
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeprechorus
this is the time
this is the place
so we look for the future
but theres not much love to go ‘round
tell me why this is a land of confusion

chorus
this is the world we live in
and these are the hands were given
use them and lets start trying
to make it a place worth living in

i remember long ago
ooh when the sun was shining
and all the stars were bright
all through the night
in the wake of this madness
as i held you tight
so long ago

verse 3
i wont be coming home tonight
my generation will put it right
were not just making promises
that we know well never keep
prechorus
too many men
too many people
making too many problems
and not much love to go ‘round
cant you see
this is a land of confusion

chorus
now this is the world we live in
and these are the hands were given
use them and lets start trying
to make it a place worth fighting for

this is the world we live in
and these are the names were given
stand up and lets start showing
just where our lives are going to5embed"
