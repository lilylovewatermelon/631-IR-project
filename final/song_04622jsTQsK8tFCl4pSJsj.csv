woke up and had a face to face
guess my reflection had a lot to say
why let my worries steal my days
it just brings me down

chorus
does the song you sing
have enough meaning
inspire us to sing along
does the song you sing
keep echoing
inspire us to sing the song you sing

verse 2
whats wrong with the world today
tell me whats all the talk about
lately ive been in a real bad place
cant let the world bring me down

chorus
does the song you sing
have enough meaning
inspire us to sing along
does the song you sing
keep echoing
inspire us to sing the song you sing
