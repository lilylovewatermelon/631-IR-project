angel of mercy how did you find me
where did you read my story
pulled from the papers desperate and hardened
seeking a momentary fix

prechorus
all i wanted to say all i wanted to do has fallen apart now
all i wanted to feel i wanted to love its all my fault now
a tragedy i fear

chorus
angel of mercy how did you find me
how did you pick me up again
angel of mercy how did you move me
why am i on my feet again
and i see you
whoa whoa whoa
i feel you
whoa whoa whoa

verse 2
fortress of daylight caught me on standby
waiting to catch the quickest plane
fly me to nowhere its better than somewhere
thats where ive been and nothings changed
