are you having trouble finding sleep at night
or does your lack of conscience tell you everythings alright
i trust your good intentions that youre watching over friends
but you must think that im crazy if i dont see through that grin

chorus
so tell me what your best friend knows that i dont know
tell me why you talk me down wherever you go
youre a saint youre a queen
and im just another boy without a crown
tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
i just want to know what your best friend knows

verse 2
so vindictive youll say anything you like
the smile you fake the steps you take
you know you never could get it right
and talk is cheap so make believe your secrets find the grave
its too late you gave up your last chance to walk away

chorus
so tell me what your best friend knows that i dont know
tell me why you talk me down wherever you go
youre a saint youre a queen
and im just another boy without a crown
tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
i just want to know what your best friend knows
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likebridge
you stand a little too tall say a little too much
youre gonna bite that knowitall tongue
you tried a little too hard now im calling that bluff
big plans are coming undone
thats just typical youre so cynical
couldnt have me i didnt want you
youre selling me out to the girl i cant afford to lose

you stand a little too tall say a little too much
youre gonna bite that knowitall tongue
you tried a little too hard now im calling that bluff
big plans are coming undone
thats just typical youre so cynical
couldnt have me i didnt want you
you set yourself up to lose

chorus
so tell me what your best friend knows that i dont know
tell me why you talk me down wherever you go
youre a saint youre a queen
and im just another boy without a crown
tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
i just want to know what your best friend knows
what your best friend knows
im never gonna let this go
what your best friend knows6embed"
