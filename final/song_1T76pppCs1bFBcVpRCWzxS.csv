i dont want the street lights
laughing at the grave
he swears hes gonna give it up
its never gonna be enough

i just wanna be there
when youre all alone
thinking about a better day
when you had it in your bones

hook
this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end

verse 2
i see you in the evening
sitting on your throne
youre playing with a fireball
and posted up against the wall

i just wanna hold you
take you by your hand
and tell you that youre good enough
tell you that its gonna be tough

this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end
cos i aint got a home

verse 3
running from the street lights
shining on the grave
once youve had the good stuff
never gonna fill you up

i wanna be the one who
gives them all a whirl
and gives them all the finger at it
just a little taste of it

hook
this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end
this could be the end
cos i aint got a home
ill forever roam
said i aint got a home
ill forever roam
no i aint got a home
ill forever roam
i aint got a home6embed"
