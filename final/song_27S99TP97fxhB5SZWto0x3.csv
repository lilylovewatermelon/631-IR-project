verse 1
did you hear the one about me being a punk
did you hear the one about me being a drunk
did you hear the one about me losing my nerve
or how im just another fuckin sheep in the herd
did you hear about the money how it made me change
so funny to me all the time that they waste
did you hear the one about me giving a shit
cause if i ever did i dont remember it

chorus
you can be me and i will be you
you can live just like a star
ill take my sanity you take the fame
im under it over it all
im under and over it

postchorus

did you hear the one about me playing the game
selling my soul and changing my name
did you hear the one about me being a prick
did you know i dont care and you can suck my—
did you hear the one about me trying to die
fist in the air and a finger to the sky
do i care if you hate me do you wanna know the truth
cest la vie adiós good riddance fuck you

chorus
you can be me and i will be you
you can live just like a star
ill take my sanity you take the fame
im under it over it all
im under and over it
