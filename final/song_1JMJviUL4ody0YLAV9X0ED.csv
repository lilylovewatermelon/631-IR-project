well you got it so good you live for the action
used to be a hasbeen now you got yourself some satisfaction
a dog in a bag and a bone

hook 1
but youre lost in the rain 21 million miles from home

verse 2
you got brand new shoes a healthy fixation
atomic heart and a two for one education
youre breaking my heart all the way

hook 2
with your dog in a bag i need your badness just to get through the day

bridge
its a million oclock too hot to sleep
a rotten taste in my mouth and my eyes are deep
theres nothing much really going on up here
im holding on for dear life and one more beer
i guess you could say its a sick little show
a bottle of troubles and a bed full of woe
its easy to see without looking too far
youd have to be a saint to be as sick as you are
you might also likeverse 3
while half the worlds asleep the rest of them are dreaming
god forbid if you forget to close the door as youre leaving
i hate to see you in a bind

hook 3
with your dog in a bag sleeping next to your ridiculous mind
with a dog in a bag sleeping next to your ridiculous mind
with a dog in a bag sleeping next to your ridiculous mind1embed"
