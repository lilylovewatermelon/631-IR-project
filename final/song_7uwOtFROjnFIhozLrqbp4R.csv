play house put my favorite record on
get down get your crystal method on
you were like tall tan driving round the city
flirtin with the girls like “youre so pretty”
springsteen is the king dont ya think
i was like hell yeah that guy can sing
like oohoohooh
oohoohooh

chorus
you make me crazy you make me wild
just like a baby spin me round like a child
your skin so golden brown
be young be dope be proud
like an american
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
like an american
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
