turning learning me as the definition prolific gifted

embrace the brainstorm

verse 4 rabbi darkside

my raps  mates have got a little extra 
live la noche vida in the city where the flow
is breezy and adventure is 
nothing is easy  it’s no illusion like houdini
count my friends and count my blessings that’s the best to be

breez hitting trees in the ride like i’m tiger
writer of the most prolific sickest vision fix your face you biter

repeat the eight i speak delete the mp3s of enemies
obscenities  this that motherfucking shit yeah
atari blitz’ll skip  yeah hear me for the next year

verse 8 agent 23
nothing stronger than an idea whose time has come
mine’s now  my styles shine bright and blind the sun
and son the rest of planets spin like a request from
a dj ‘cause me god and rap had a threeway
too many styles from ebay  need to pull the ebrake
i invented mine spending time on the freeways
the rap jack kerouac  my burners crack your thermostat
agent 23 came too far for turning back
	
verse 9 dacapo
birth the seed was planted and now potential’s born
pain the storms and living’ll crystalize the form
love of the past and present to make the future strong
knowledge that the spark to make it was in you all along
faith tribulations definite filter lesser men
wisdom the evidence demonstrating the excellence
courage ‘cause fear wastes time nobody messes with
honor of the most omnipotent and beneficent
outro sample from joe esposito  youre the best
youre the best around
nothings gonna ever keep you downembed"
