verse 1 ice cube
i know ya like to see me doin bad

candied out while you spent yo last on the pearl

and lead in my holster face on the poster

im a be as real as i can with this
not just the fake analyst on cannabis
who only say that the world is
scandalous without findin out a way to handle this
dismantle this either with the rhyme or the fist
how the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch
i be rich if it wasnt for the snitch
lyin to the enemies bout conspiracies
im a say this till the day that i die
seven thirty fives bring on bitches lies
while you bullshittin im hard hittin like 2pac
i keep spittin till my heart stop
young niggas tryin to tell me that im played
once they say you played nigga you must be paid ha ha huh ha
pushin weight since the tenth grade do my thing
got more plaques than jordan got rings nigga sayin

chorus chris rock  ice cube

verse 3 ice cube
i hate to see your ass comin yep with your mouth runnin
talkin bout somethin what that aint meanin nothin
bout your second cousin hmm who be always buzzin
where she was or wasnt who she now fuckin
stories by the dozen plus you got the sequel what
to let you tell it randy moss is your people
its evident your ass lie like the president
but stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence ha ha
how the fuck can your friends be the benjamins punk
and your little ass cars full of fender bends
there you go on the stand with your hand up lyin
testifyin about a man thats in handcuffs
we should do you like the mack said
and if he lie like a crackhead pop em like a black head
let him ooze let him loose
let him lie by his motherfuckin ass on the news yeah yeah

chorus chris rock  ice cube
