two packs of cigarettes a day
the strongest whiskey kentucky can make
thats a recipe
to put a vagabond on his hands and knees
i watched it all up close i knew him more than most
i saw a side of him he never showed
full of sympathy
for a world that wouldnt let him be

prechorus
thats the man he was
have you heard enough

chorus
what a shame what a shame
to judge a life that you cant change
the choir sings the church bells ring
so wont you give this man his wings
what a shame
to have to beg you to see
were not all the same
what a shame

verse 2
theres a hard life for every silver spoon
theres a touch of grey for every shade of blue
thats the way that i see life
if there was nothin wrong then thered be nothin right
and for this workin man they say could barely stand
theres gotta be a better place to land
some kind of remedy
for a world that wouldnt let him be

thats the man he was
have you heard enough

chorus
what a shame what a shame
to judge a life that you cant change
the choir sings the church bells ring
so wont you give this man his wings
what a shame
to have to beg you to see
were not all the same
what a shame

bridge
god forgive the hands that laid you down
they never knew how
much a broken heart can break the sound
and change the seasons
now the leaves are fallin faster
happily ever after
you gave me hope through your endeavors
and now you will live forever

chorus
what a shame what a shame
to judge a life that you cant change
the choir sings the church bells ring
so wont you give this man his wings
what a shame
to have to beg you to see
were not all the same
what a shame what a shame
cause were not all the same
what a shame what a shame
cause were not all the same1embed"
