raymonds in his sunday best hes usually up to his chest
in oil and grease
theres the martins walkin in with that mean little frecklefaced kid
who broke a window last week

prechorus
sweet miss betty likes to sing offkey in the pew behind me

chorus
thats what i love about sunday
sing along as the choir sways
every verse of amazing grace
then we shake the preachers hand
go home into your blue jeans
have some chicken and some baked beans
pick a backyard football team
not do much of anything
thats what i love about sunday

verse 2
i stroll to the end of the drive pick up the sunday times
grab a coffee cup
it looks like sally and ron finally tied the knot
well its about time
prechorus
theres thirtyfive cents off of ground round baby cut that coupon out
chorus 
thats what i love about sunday
catnappin on the porch swing
you curled up next to me
the smell of jasmine wakes us up
take a walk down a back road
tackle box and a cane pole
carve our names in that white oak
ill steal a kiss as the sun fades
thats what i love about sunday oh yeah
bridge
oh new believers gettin baptized
mamas hands raised up high
havin a hallelujah good time
a smile on everybodys face
thats what i love about sunday sunday oh yeah
