roll in the bar me and my crew
their little plan to get me over you
theyre hookin’ me up yeah
buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
theres just one thing
chorus
i cant go anywhere i cant do anything
no i cant close my eyes without you in my dreams
you wont leave me alone even though i know youre gone
i look around for someone new but i see you
jumpin’ up there with the band
takin’ me by the hand
hey boy come dance with me
stuck like a melody in my head
in the bed of my truck
by the light of the midnight moon
baby i see you

verse 2
dont know what you did but you done it good
you dont know how bad that i wish i could
delete you from my phone find a girl and take her home
but theres just one thing wrong
