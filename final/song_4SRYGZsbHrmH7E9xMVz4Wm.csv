youre so pretty when you cry when you cry

and together were so good so girl why

just tell me what i did lets work through it
theres gotta be some way
to get you to want me like before

chorus harry all
cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
and it hurts cause i know you wont be mine tonight
no one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
baby tell me how to make it right
now all of my friends say its not really worth it
but even if thats true
no one in the world could stop me from not moving on
baby even if i wanted to
nobody compares to you
