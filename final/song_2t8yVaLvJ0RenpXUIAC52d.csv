but the other side was sunny i get paid to rap on beats

verse 3 j cole
question
how many faking they streams a lot
getting they plays from machines a lot
i can see behind the smoke and mirrors
niggas aint really big as they seem hmm
i never say anything nah everybody got they thing true
some niggas make millions other niggas make memes hmm
im on a money routine
i dont want smoke i want cream
i dont want no more comparisons
this is a marathon and i’m aware
i been playing it back from a lack of promotions
i never was one for the bragging and boasting
i guess i was hoping the music would speak for itself but the people want everything else
okay no problem i’ll show up on everyone album
you know what the outcome will be
im batting a thousand
it’s got to the point that these rappers dont even like rappin with me
fuck it cause my nigga 21 savage just hit me
and told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
he call it a lot i open my book and i jot
pray for tekashi they want him to rot
i picture him inside a cell on a cot
’flectin on how he made it to the top
wondering if it was worth it or not
i pray for markelle cause they fucked up his shot
just want you to know that you got it my nigga
though i never met you i know that you special
and that the lord blessed you dont doubt it my nigga
dennis smith jr stay solid my nigga
im on a tangent not how i planned it
i had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
when they thought that i wasnt gon pan out i got a plan
they say that success is the greatest revenge tell all your friends
cole on a mission cementin the spot as the greatest that did it
before it all ends nigga
