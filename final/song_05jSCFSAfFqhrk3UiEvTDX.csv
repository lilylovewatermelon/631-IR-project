that would ever bring a tear to your eye
ive never crossed the line
or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
but darling ill admit
thereve been times when i could have
the thing that kept me strong
is the one thing that is always on my mind

chorus
when i think about cheatin
i just think about you leavin
and how my world would fall to pieces
if i tossed your love away
even when im tempted by some stranger
oh theres never any danger
i just think about you leavin
when i think about cheatin

there was a time in abilene
when he said all the things i wanted to hear
it was hard to turn him down
between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
but it just took one twostep with someone and i was missing you
he never had a chance cause i broke up the dance
before the song was through
