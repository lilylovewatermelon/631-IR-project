you told us that
we were too young
now that night’s closing in
and in the half light we run
lock us up safe
and hide the key
but the night tears us loose
and in the half light we’re free

verse 2 win butler win butler  régine chassagne
strange how the half light
can make a place new
you can’t recognize me
and i can’t recognize you
we run through these streets
that we know so well
and the houses hide so much
but in the half light
none of us can tell
they hide the ocean in a shell
the ocean in a shell

verse 3 win butler  régine chassagne
our heads are just houses
without enough windows
you say you hear human voices
but they’re only echoes
they’re only echoes
they’re only echoes
only echoes

we are not asleep
we are in the streets
we are not asleep
we are in the streets
we are not asleep
we are in the streets5embed"
