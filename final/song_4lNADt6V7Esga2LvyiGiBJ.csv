we are the children you reject and disregard
these aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
you cant disown us now we are our own flesh and blood
and we dont disappear just because your eyes are shut

prechorus
now tell me
love loss like a bullets path
tear through the cavity of my chest
lights out because the fuse has blown

chorus
as their castles crumble slowly
we watch them fall
the crown slips from heads unworthy
as we gain control

verse 2
this is the family that we crossed or never had
this is a war that was lost the day that it began
cause its the race we run but it keeps us at the start
and its the song i sung from the bottom of my heart

prechorus
thats how we
read you like a polygraph
not one single bone in your back
own up to how you let us down
you might also likechorus
as their castles crumble slowly
we watch them fall
the crown slips from heads unworthy
as we gain control

bridge
except for you and me love
everyones the same
we know we know we know we know
but if to live we have to be numb
id rather know the pain
id rather know id rather know

this happens almost never
but it happened once to me
and this will never be same
the ends we seam together

bridge
im not after fame and fortune
im after you
when ive served my time i swear i
will come back for you

chorus
as their castles crumble slowly
we watch them fall
the crown slips from heads unworthy
right on to ours but im after you8embed"
