hardly spoke to folks around him didnt have too much to say
no one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
for the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

it was early in the morning when he rode into the town
he came ridin from the south side slowly lookin all around
hes an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
and hes here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

in this town there lived an outlaw by the name of texas red
many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
he was vicious and a killer though a youth of twentyfour
and the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
one and nineteen more

now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
he was an arizona ranger wouldnt be too long in town
he came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
and he said it didnt matter he was after texas red
after texas red

the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
it was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
folks were watching from their windows everybody held their breath
they knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
was about to meet his death
you might also likethere was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
and the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
texas red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
and the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
the big iron on his hip

big iron big iron
when he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
the big iron on his hipembed"
