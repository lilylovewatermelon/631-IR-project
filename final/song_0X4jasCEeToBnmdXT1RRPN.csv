i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend

verse 1
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
and you know it makes me sick to be on that list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
you say you’re gonna burn before you mellow
i will be the one to burn you
why’d you have to go and pick me
when you knew that we were different completely

chorus
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend

verse 2
i’m another exgirlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
your wildness scares me
so does your freedom
you say you can’t stand the restrictions
i find myself trying to change you
if you were meant to be my lover i wouldn’t have to
and i feel so mean i feel in between
‘cause i’m about to give you away

i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
for someone else to take
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
am i making a mistake
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
all the time that we spent
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend

i’m another exgirlfriend on your list

i know i messed up
i’m about to give you away for someone else to take
i’m about to give you away for someone else to take

verse 3
we keep repeating mistakes for souvenirs
and we’ve been in between the days for years
and i know that when i see you i’m going to die
i know i’m going to want you and you know why
it’s going to kill me to see you with the next girl
‘cause i’m the most gorgeously jealous kind of exgirl
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
chorus
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend
i hope i hold a special place with the rest of them
all the time that we spent
i kinda always knew i’d end up your exgirlfriend

outro
and now i’m another exgirlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed
now i’m another exgirlfriend on your list
but i should have thought of that before we kissed4embed"
