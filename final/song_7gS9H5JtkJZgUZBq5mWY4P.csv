believe me natalie listen natalie this is
your last chance to find a gogo dance to disco now
please believe me natalie listen natalie this is
your last chance to find a gogo dance to disco now
forget what they said in soho leave the oh nos out
and believe me natalie listen natalie this is
your last chance

chorus 2
there is an old cliché under your monet baby
remember the arch of roses right above your couch
forget what they said in soho leave the oh nos out
yes there is an old cliché under your monet baby

bridge
you left the station now to the floor
with speculation what was it for
in that old hallway mom says why dont you
stay youve been away for a long time

outro
believe me natalie this is your last chance
your last chance to find a gogo
forget what they said in soho
and walk away
if my dreams for us cant get you through just one more day
its alright by me
god help me somehow
theres no time for survival left
the time is now cause this might be
your last chance to disco
