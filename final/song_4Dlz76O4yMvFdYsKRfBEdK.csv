have you heard the news today
they say a little 14year old little girl had a baby on the way
too much for her little mind to bear
and that type of news to her mama she cannot spare

hook andré 3000
toilet tisha damn we miss you
toilet tisha is the issue
damn we miss you toilet tisha
damn we miss you

interlude
tisha tisha tisha girl what you doing
oh my god oh tisha tisha
ah no tisha tisha
ah no not my baby
ah no i love you no
ah good lord ah

bridge andré 3000
dont go away
dont you dare go away from me girl—i can help you
dont go away dont you dare leave
dont go away it aint a thang
dont go away

five thousand one hundred ten days is a short period of time
a mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
you see tisha had issues
and her decision making skills were still in its early stages
you know what im talking about
therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
she thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
pause just like a brother with a thousand pauses
should i shouldnt i i cant i have to mama will never see me the same
daddy and big mama i know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
as she sits on top of the pale cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
the unthinkable moments away from becoming reality sadly with no clue
and no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
fatality fatality fatality fatality4embed"
