oh the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
since theres no place to go
let it snow let it snow let it snow
it doesnt show signs of stoppin
but i brought some corn for poppin
the lights are turned way down low
let it snow let it snow let it snow

verse 2 scott
when we finally kiss goodnight
how ill hate going out in the storm
but if you really hold me tight
all the way home ill be warm
oh the fire is slowly dying
but my dear were still goodbyeing
but as long as you love me so
let it snow let it snow let it snow
let it snow let it snow
let it snow let it snow

when we finally kiss goodnight
how ill hate going out in the storm
but if you really grab me tight
