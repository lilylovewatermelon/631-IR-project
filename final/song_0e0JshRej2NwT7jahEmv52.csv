ayy somebody got a j i could light in this bitch

verse 1
im a rolling stone stone
im too wild for you to own
in a whip thats meant to speed phew phew phew
if i hurt you would you leave
i learned the game from some heavyweights
catching buses makin change from another play change
i still got demons from my younger days
i wish i could shake em but they follow me
i wish i could take it easy but these fans watch
ask my mama i been hustlin since the sandbox
im a rolling stone

chorus
im sorry in advance if i let you down
im sorry in advance if i let you down

bridge
bitch you just spilled louis 13 on my mcqueens
damn back the fuck up
i got all this pimp shit up in my genes oh

verse 2
blame that on my mothеr
i cant go nowhere thats less than mе
ask my lovers im troubled
first im exciting then im gaslighting make up your mind
im rich as fuck and i aint nothing at the same time
people hate me and they love me at the same time damn damn damn
i guess im everything and nothing at the same time
