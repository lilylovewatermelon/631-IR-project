i bet you think that youre the only ones
that the brightest lights will keep on burning for you
you keep on weaving round a smoking gun
go on and let them talk
well give them something to do

were not here waiting up for you
theres no more time for that
were not here praying just for you
theres no more tears to lean on

were not here praying just for you
theres no more tears to cry for you
