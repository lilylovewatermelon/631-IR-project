well im getting older
and im growing tired
i aint seen a mirror in a long long while
ive lost a lot of weight
and most of my mind
but damn you whiskey
youve let me down for the last time

chorus
whiskey and the devil
and all the hell its put me through
the devil drove me to drinking
the drinking drove me away from you
and i still have your memory
thats one thing i cant leave behind
well damn you whiskey
youve let me down for the last time

verse 2
out on this road
its lonely and cold
i cant seem to find you
no matter where i go
and this old bottle
has been a thorn in my side
well damn you whiskey
youve let me down for the last time
you might also likechorus
whiskey and the devil
and all the hell its put me through
the devil drove me to drinking
the drinking drove me away from you
and i still have your memory
thats one thing i cant leave behind
well damn you whiskey
youve let me down for the last time

outro
well im getting older
and im growing tired
i aint seen a mirror in a long long whileembed"
