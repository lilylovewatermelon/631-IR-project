i see you comb your hair and gimme that grin
its making me spin now spinnin within
before i melt like snow i say hello how do you do
how do you do
i love the way you undress now baby begin
do your caress honey my hearts in a mess
i love your blueeyed voice like tiny tim shines through
how do you do

chorus cascada
how do you do do you do the things that you do
no one i know could ever keep up with you
how do you do did it ever make sense to you to say bye bye bye
how do you do do you do the things that you do
no one i know could ever keep up with you
how do you do did it ever make sense to you to say bye bye bye
