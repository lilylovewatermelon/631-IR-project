there is not a single word
in the whole world
that could describe the hurt
the dullest knife just sawing back and forth
and ripping through the softest skin there ever was

prechorus
how were you to know
oh how were you to know

chorus
and i
i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before
and i
i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before

verse 2
love happens all the time
to people who arent kind
and heroes who are blind
expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
who wants an awkward silent mystery

well how were you to knowohoh

chorus
and i
i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before
and i
i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before

bridge
for all the air thats in your lungs
for all the joy that is to come
for all the things that youre alive to feel
just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

prechorus
oh how were you to know how were you to know
oh how were you to know

i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before

i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before18embed"
