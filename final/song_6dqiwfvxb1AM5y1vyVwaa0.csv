i see nothing out the window window
nothing out the window
watching all the leaves grow leaves grow
feels better in my dreams though dreams though

verse
and the sun will shine no more
the sun will shine antidote no more
ive been holdin on too long
holdin on too

prechorus
i know when the wind blows wind blows
feels better in my dreams though dreams though
i just wanna sleep forever
please just let me leave forever

chorus
i dont need an antidote antidote
i dont need an antidote antidote
i dont need an antidote forever
forever forever

bridge
we dont wanna drive slow drive slow
speed up with our eyes closed eyes closed

eyes closed eyes closed
head down eyes closed
