honey come over
the partys gone slower
and no one will tempt you
we know you got sober
theres orange juice in the kitchen
bought for the children
its yours if you want it
were just glad you could visit

chorus
feels like ive been ready for you to come home
for so long
that i didnt think to ask you where youd gone
whyd you go

postchorus
and you said
mmhmm mmhmmmm
and you said
you said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
and my heart and my heart
now my face has changed and i havent drank
in six months on the dot

verse 2
see the graves as you pass through
from our crash back in 02
not one nick on your finger
you just asked mе to hold you
but it made you a stranger
and filled you with angеr
now im third in the line up
to your lord and your savior

feels like ive been ready for you to come home
for so long
that i didnt think to ask you where youd gone
so whyd you go

postchorus
and you said
mm hmmmm hmmmm mm
you said
mmhmm
you said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
and my heart and my heart
that my life has changed that this town had changed and you had not
that the world has changed dont you find it strange
that you just went ahead and carried on
and you know id say the last time i drank
i was face down passed out there in your lawn
are we all just crows to you now
are we all just pullin you down
you didnt put those bones in the ground
you didnt put those bones in the ground

outro
honey come over
the partys gone slower
and no one will tempt you
we know you got sober
theres orange juice in the kitchen
bought for the children
its yours if you want it
were just glad you could visitembed"
