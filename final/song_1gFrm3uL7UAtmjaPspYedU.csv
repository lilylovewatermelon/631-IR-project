never again will i be dishonored
and never again will i be reminded
of living within the world of the jaded
they kill inspiration its my obligation
to never again allow this to happen
where do i begin the choices are endless
denying the sin
my art my redemption
i carry the torch of my fathers before me

chorus
the thing i treasure the most in life
cannot be taken away
there will never be a reason why
i will surrender to your advice
to change myself id rather die
though they will not understand
i wont make the greatest sacrifice
you cant predict where the outcome lies
youll never take me alive

postchorus

change again cannot be considered
i rage again dispelling my anger
where do i begin the choices are endless
my art my redemption
my only salvation
i carry the gift that i have been blessed with
my soul is adrift in oceans of madness
repairing the rift that you have created
i am not alone brothers give me your arms now

chorus
the thing i treasure most in life
cannot be taken away
there will never be a reason why
i will surrender to your advice
to change myself id rather die
though they will not understand
i wont make the greatest sacrifice
you cant predict where the outcome lies
youll never take me alive

bridge
im no slave are you feeling brave
or have you gone out of your mind
no more games it wont feel the same
if i hold my anger inside
theres no meaning my soul is bleeding
ive had enough of your kind
one suggestion use your discretion
before you label me blind
chorus
the thing i treasure most in life
cannot be taken away
there will never be a reason why
i will surrender to your advice
to change myself id rather die
though they will not understand
i wont make the greatest sacrifice
you cant predict where the outcome lies
youll never take me alive
