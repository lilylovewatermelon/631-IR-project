look in my eyes
im jaded now whatever that means
by sharing these things
i rip my heart out
its worth my time
whatever that means so

verse 2
hard to see up
my neck feels stiff until i wake up
the orange i choked
and back to my neck
its worth my time
whatever that means so

chorus
share with me
cause i need it right now
let me see your insides
or write me off
cause id rather starve now
if you wont open up

verse 3
give it to me
give me all
whatever you want
its never been me
to want this much
from you i can see
yeah

share with me
cause i need it right now
let me see your insides
or write me off
cause id rather starve now
if you wont open up
you wont open up
