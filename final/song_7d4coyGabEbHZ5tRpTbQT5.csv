i just shook the handshake i just sealed the deal
ill try not to let them take everything they can steal
people always told me said dont forget your roots
i know i can feel them underneath my leather boots

chorus 1
you toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
and you watch it go
your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
get lost when the wind blows
the handshakes stuck on the tip of my tongue
it tastes like death but it looks like fun

bridge
i was a loner i was just waiting by myself
when you warped temptress rose to bring me happiness and wealth
black tears black smile black credit cards and shoes
you can call all the people you want but its you whos being used
under your black eyes honey right beneath your nose
a curse on all creation every single thing you know
white smoke white light white marble on the floor
it would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out whats in store
little girl

chorus 2
you convince yourself that you want it
but you dont know
you keep on tryin to wash the blood from your hands
but it wont go
were gonna keep you on the run
we got the handshake under our tongue
we got the handshake under our tongue
we got the handshake under our tongue
we got the handshake under our tongue
you might also likeoutro
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake
we got the handshake6embed"
