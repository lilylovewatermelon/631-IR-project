night is dragging her feet
i wait alone in the heat
i know know that youll have your way
til you have to go home
nos a word i cant say

chorus
cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
and it gets me nowhere to make you go
will a little more love make you stop depending
will a little more love bring a happy ending
will a little more love make it right
will a little more love make it right

verse 2
where where did my innocence go
how how was a young girl to know
im trapped trapped in the spell of your eyes
in the warmth of your arms in the web of your lies

chorus
but it gets me nowhere to tell you no
and it gets me nowhere to make you go
will a little more love make you stop depending
will a little more love bring a happy ending
will a little more love make it right
will a little more love make it right hey
