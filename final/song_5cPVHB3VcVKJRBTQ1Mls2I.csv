this morning is monday
where are you now
teasing my memory
teaching me how to lay low
when i dont want to

your love is elusive
this i know now
its making me crazy
leaving me out in the open
when i dont want to

chorus
baby i cant go through this again
i dont need to go down
more than ive already been

just like a wildfire
youre running all over town
as much as you burn me baby
i should be ashes by now

verse 2
the moment of pleasure
just never do last
theyre gone like a suitcase
full of your past
long gone and in a hurry
see lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likerepeat chorus

bridge
youre running all over town
as much as you burn me baby
i should be ashes by now

just like a wildfire
youre running all over town
as much as you burn me baby

repeat x2
i should be ashes by now

ooooo ashes by now
ooooo ashes by now

as much as you burn me baby
i should be ashes by nowembed"
