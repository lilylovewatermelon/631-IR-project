if youre willing to wait for the love of your life
please wait by the line
and you know dispersive prisms rainbow
but my native optimism isnt broken by the light
the idea of life without company fell suddenly
it crashed through the ceiling on me and pinned me to the pine
and layer upon layer of hope and doubt
will crush bones to oil in time

chorus
are you a pusher or are you a puller
i pull the weight towards me
and i lack the zest of a lemon looking forward
unless i have a woman pushing me

verse 2
a canopy of redbilled quelea
passed over the blue
a fivehour flock not one dives down
to tell you the truth
as night falls a quelea crawls
and whispers on his last wings
so abundant are we left alone i shall be
but a waited phone never rings
you might also likechorus
are you a pusher or are you a puller
i pull the weight towards me
and i lack the zest of a lemon looking forward
unless i have a woman pushing me
are you a pusher or are you a puller
we could hold hands for fifteen minutes in the sauna
we could hold hands for a pool length underwater
i can push and pull her

outro
if youre willing to wait for the love of your life
please wait by the line37embed"
