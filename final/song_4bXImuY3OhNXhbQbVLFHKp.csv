you saw me on a television
setting fire to all the buildings
yeah i guess you saw me stealing
but youve no idea what ive been needing
we talk about when we were children
not the kind of kid that you believe in
you saw me on a television
saw me on a television

chorus
but thats just the half of it
yeah you saw the half of it
this is the life i live
and thats just the half of it

verse 2
you saw me on a television
hanging out my dirty linen
youre entitled to your own opinion
sit and shake your head at my decisions
i guess the kind of songs that ive been singing
make it seem as if im always winnin
but you saw me on a television
yeah you saw me on a television
