all because of

somethings wrong with me
cause i cant even feel you now or know that this is real
am i too blind to see
that theres something there behind your eyes
and its bringing me to my knees

all i want is you and i dont care
all i want is you and i dont care

cause all i do is waiting and wondering
and hoping that well survive it
i know that all this is true
all because of you
all because of you

somethings wrong with you
the walls you build around you now seem to fit you like a glove
somethings wrong with you
cause stars cannot be found in clouds that cover up their love

all i want is you and i dont care
all i want is you and i dont care
you might also likecause all i do is waiting and wondering
and hoping that well survive it
i know that all this is true
all because of you
all because of you
all because of you

all because of you
all because of you
all because of you
all because of you
all because of you

all i want is you and i dont care
all because of you
all i want is you and i dont care
all because of you
all i want is you and i dont care
all because of you
all i want is you and i dont careembed"
