quick shadow dribbling down me
im looking over my shoulder
justifying anythings easy

because it feels nice”
then no more on that subject

just if im within the interstices
then im looking for when you come ‘round

chorus
somebody once told me
“loosen up your eyes
because it feels nice”

i blindly led you on and me in the process
