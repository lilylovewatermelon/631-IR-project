we drove right past
that no trespassing sign
we sat on the tailgate
and watched the planes take off
we thought we had all night
there was no need to rush
thats when those cops
came pulling up
and i thought
man aint this some shhhh

prechorus
your daddys gonna kill me
but if i survive tonight
i wouldnt change one thing
baby yeah
i know it sounds crazy

chorus
but there was somethin bout the way
the blue lights were shinin
bringing out the freedom in your eyes
i was too busy watching you going wild child
to be worried about going to jail
you were thinking that running for it
would make a good story
i was thinking you were crazy as hell
you were so innocent
but you were stealing my heart
i fell in love in the back of a cop car
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 2
man they werent playin
they sure put those cuffs on quick
you tried to sweet talk em
they didnt fall for it but i did
you were on the left i was on the right
i knew you didnt smoke
when you asked him for a light
and i laughed
he got mad and slammed the door

prechorus
i swear your daddys gonna kill me
but if i survive tonight
i wouldnt change one thing
baby yeah
i know it sounds crazy

chorus
but there was somethin bout the way
the blue lights were shinin
bringing out the freedom in your eyes
i was too busy watching you going wild child
to be worried about going to jail
you were thinking that running for it
would make a good story
i was thinking you were crazy as hell
you were so innocent
but you were stealing my heart
i fell in love in the back of a cop car
bridge
and you were like oh woah oh
side by side
and locked in tight
they were taking their time
but we didnt mind
we talked and we laughed
we sat real close
by the time they let us go
i was already gone

chorus
cause there was somethin bout the way
the blue lights were shinin
bringing out the freedom in your eyes
i was too busy watching you going wild child
to be worried about going to jail
you were thinking that running for it
would make a good story
i was thinking you were crazy as hell
but you were so innocent
but you were stealing my heart
i fell in love in the back the back the cop car

outro
i fell in love in the back of a cop car cop car6embed"
