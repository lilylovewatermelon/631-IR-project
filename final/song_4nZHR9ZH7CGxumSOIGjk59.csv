verse 1
good luck time to get hood stuck
caldasac trap mr good stuff ludacris give me 20 pushups
last summer got da hook up you know what i did
whod eva thought up they grew up on one of the bebe kids
diaper rash still on my ass and fiendin for cash
almost got signed with puff puff but i think ill pass
now what we got round here is a 2020 twins
and whats up in my hand is a bottle of gin
i love women so im in it to win it in it to green
in it to get in it and get in it again
you got two booties so you wipin yo chin and i dont blame you
i lay in da sand yall lay in da snow and make angels
my ice piece dangle make my chest look older
touch it and fall apart like yo high school folder
im a trojan man bhs hall supplier
shady park resident and southside rider

verse 2
get back time to get hood jacked gold chain took dat
world of ghetto fabulous dopeboys and hoodrats
be careful what you look at cause you lookin too long
you might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
im gettin neck while im singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party while yall hittin da bong
but yall be hittin my schlong you play the flute quite nicely
when teeth interrupt you can watch as i get fiesty
oh no you suck again request back up
broads i seem to rack up when i pull da gold acta
get slapped up drove up da wall put it in reverse
you can hope for the best but expect the worst
you at a place like some ds on a hurst its quite funny
phat rabbit playboy bunny
it seems as if thats what i need filthy south and ds
thats why i roll in from da southside breeze give it to me now
