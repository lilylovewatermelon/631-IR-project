intro
this is how monsters function
leave me alone
i aint fucking with nobody

verse 1
keep fucking with me you going turn me back to booboo
have me casing out your crib trying to pop your fucking noodles
she was 20 i was 12 man my nana said she raped me
i just smiled from ear to ear saying take me baby take me
since high school nigga i aint got no friends
got two 380s like the ying yang twins haaan
thats spot clicking till the ds run in
then its bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends
freshman year i had that cbr hurricane
in a ill herringbone i got them swinging heroine
i shoot a nigga in a heartbeat i aint no chump
then you can run forrest run retard when i dump
they take kindness for weakness niggas dont respect that
so me im where that ruger that pump and that tec at
some look at me im on now i thought we was rich then
shipment but you had like twenty bricks in richmond
we was in cocaine heaven i was fishscale dreaming
we just got in the town we was strapped up scheming
first country caught a body then country caught a body
then i popped a couple niggas then country shot everybody
its cold blooded its real shit you got to love it
treyeight snub it and dont think nothing of it
its the way of the wolves its how they train us to move
get it popping when we shopping niggas hold down the tools
see 50 cent liveget tickets as low as 87you might also likehook
i seen niggas getting rich
then days went by then days went by then days went by
i was tired of not having shit
then days went by then days went by then days went by
i seen niggas getting hit
then days went by then days went by then days went by
we was slinging that shit
then days went by then days went by then days went by
here i am

verse 2
unsure since we was little niggas son since we were seven
armed robbery first degree my man did seven
niggas popped his whip up hit his camry with a seven
he a lucky motherfucker i bet he make it to heaven
my grandpa drunk my uncle rock drunk
my uncle champ pump crack smoked my fucking stash up
i had 250 grams stashed on the porch
i mean how much you going to smoke man
how much you going to snort
first the vcr went then the tv went
he stole out of mommy purse
she thought it was me kid
i aint ask her for no money son
cause i was out hustling
she was looking at me sideways like im a thief or something
that hurt me come on son that wouldnt hurt you
i pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
i need anger management see i hold on to a grudge
the same way i hold on to that nickelplate snub
bridge
the lord dont have imperfections baby
so i think im perfect the way he made me
some say im cool some say im crazy
some say i aint shit some say im amazing
