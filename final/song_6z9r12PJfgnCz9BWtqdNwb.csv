verse 1
landlord’s knockin at my door cussin me out
got laid off my job the night before yeah
can’t figure how im gonna fix tomorrow when yesterdays still a mess
can you tell me whats the point man it all seems meaningless
i wish that i could step away and breathe
this worlds tryna swallow me
clear away the clouds inside my head

verse 2
people lie people lie people hide people hide
people cry people cry people fight
and they don’t know why fear
if fear is all that we should fear
then what are we so afraid of
cause fear is only in our heads
