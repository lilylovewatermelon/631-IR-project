there is a swelling storm
and im caught up in the middle of it all
and it takes control of the person that i thought i was
the boy i used to know
but there is a light in the dark
and i feel its warmth
in my hands in my heart
but why cant i hold on

prechorus
it comes and goes in waves
it always does always does
we watch as our young hearts fade
into the flood into the flood

chorus
and the freedom of falling
the feeling i thought was set in stone
it slips through my fingers
im trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves
and carries us away

verse 2
through the wind
down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
memories of a stolen place
caught in the silence an echo lost in space

it comes and goes in waves
it always does it always does
we watch as our young hearts fade
into the flood into the flood

chorus
and the freedom of falling
the feeling i thought was set in stone
it slips through my fingers
im trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves
and carries us away

bridge
ive watched my wild youth
disappear in front of my eyes
moments of magic and wonder
it seems so hard to find
is it ever coming back again
is it ever coming back again
take me back to the feeling when
everything was left to find

prechorus
it comes and goes in waves
it always does it always does
chorus
and the freedom of falling
the feeling i thought was set in stone
it slips through my fingers
im trying hard to let go
it comes and goes in waves
it comes and goes in waves
and carries us away42embed"
