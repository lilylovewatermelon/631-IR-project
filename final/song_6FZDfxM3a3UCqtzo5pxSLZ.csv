found you when your heart was broke
i filled your cup until it overflowed
took it so far to keep you close keep you close
i was afraid to leave you on your own ooh

prechorus
i said id catch you if you fall fall
and if they laugh then fuck em all all
and then i got you off your knees
put you right back on your feet
just so you could take advantage of me

chorus
tell me hows it feel sittin up there
feelin so high but too far away to hold me
you know im the one who put you up there
name in the sky does it ever get lonely
thinkin you could live without me
thinkin you could live without me
baby im the one who put you up there
i dont know why yeah i dont know why
thinkin you could live without me
live without me
baby im the one who put you up there
i dont know why i dont know why yeah yeah
