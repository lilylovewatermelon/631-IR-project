and you can bring me to my knees again
all the times that i could beg you please in vain
all the times that i felt insecure for you
and i leave my burdens at the door

chorus
but im on the outside im looking in
i can see through you see your true colors
cause inside youre ugly youre ugly like me
i can see through you see to the real you

verse 2
all the times that i felt like this wont end its for you
and i taste what i could never have it was from you
all the times that ive cried
my intentions full of pride
but i waste more time than anyone

chorus
but im on the outside im looking in
i can see through you see your true colors
cause inside youre ugly youre ugly like me
i can see through you see to the real you

bridge
all the times that ive cried
all this wasted its all inside
and i feel all this pain
stuffed it down its back again
and i lie here in bed
all alone i cant mend
but i feel tomorrow will be okay

cause inside youre ugly youre ugly like me
