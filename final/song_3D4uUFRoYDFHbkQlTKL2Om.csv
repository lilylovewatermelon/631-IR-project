if i was who i was before
then id be waiting at your door
but i cannot confess i am the same
so look at me and hear me now
with all my body screaming out
oh in my mind im thinking of a place

refrain
where no one knows me
and no one knows you
you dont know me
and i dont know you

verse 2
if you would open up your heart
drop your weapons drop your guard
just a little trust is all it takes
oh i know that youve been around
but hear me now im crying out
let me be the light upon the lake

and if you give a little get a little
maybe we could learn to love each other

if only we could find a way
to leave all of our darker days
soak in all the sweetness on our skin
and if youre waiting in the sun
then carry me on wings of love
to that brighter day where all begins

but if no one knows me
and no one knows you
you dont know me
and i dont know you
everythings fresh and
everythings new

i can feel it all just coming through
theres a whole new world just waiting baby
so much waiting just for me and you
