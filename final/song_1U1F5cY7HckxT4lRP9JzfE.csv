i wont
i wont
i wont
i wont
cause i came too far

verse 1
tryin to know whats goin on
echoes on my cellular phone
i noticed a couple items missing
could it be the feds still listening
see i outa beat those cases
dead time for the miscellaneous
and they proceed to keep on watching
cause i outa seen them lately
interrogated my mom
locked up half of my crew
but i can guarantee one thing that i wont let you do

chorus
i wont let you lock me down
i wont let you push me round
i wont let you stop me now
i wont cause i came too far

i woont cause i came too far

verse 
devils always wathing mewathing me
evils always stocking mestocking me
god has been protecting meprotecting me
and thats how i got this far
cause when you look at me you see an angel
