little me
i have a lovely light
im the star
upon your tree
that makes your christmas bright

i left the milky way
just so i could come and be with you on christmas day

chorus 1
angels brought me where you are
and heaven gave me light
im that friendly little star
you wish upon each night

twinkle twinkle little me
i have a present too
if you give unselfishly
and make a wish come true
ill always shine for you

hi kids
look out your window
you see that little star way up there
the one thats all alone
well thats me

and this christmas im coming all the way down
to where you are
just to light up your christmas tree
and i hope
to light up your hearts

and make a wish come true
