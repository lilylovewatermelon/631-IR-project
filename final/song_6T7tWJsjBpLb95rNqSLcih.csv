wasnt ready for it all
autumn came and all the leaves they had to fall
ive been waiting for a call
just to be close to you

lose somebody like you
i hear you when the wind blows
it follows me where i go

lose somebody like you

verse
you know my life just like a book how im turning the page
reading our chapter hoping that i end in a change
you know this shit dont feel right wrapped in my rage oh yeah
you know i got you on my mind forevеr so often
looking back at it now i can see how we lost it
in the coupе behind tint on the way from new orleans

i tried to find another bitch i just look for you in her
and my hotel await in houston my happiness gone
