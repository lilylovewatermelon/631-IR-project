i said whos that girl there
i wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
she dont do major credit cards i doubt she does receipts
its all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance i bet hell rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes yeah that hes got a drivin ban
amongst some other offences
and ive seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
theyre all infected but hell be alright
cause hes a scumbag dont you know
i said hes a scumbag dont you know

avert your eyes and starin at the ground

and oh he must be up to summat
what are the chances sure its more than likely
ive got a feelin in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be yeah

look here comes a ford mondeo
isnt he mr inconspicuous
and he dont even have to say owt
shes in the stance ready to get picked up
bet shes delighted when she sees him
pullin in and givin her the eye
because she must be fucking freezin
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
it dont stop in the winter no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
well they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river goin out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here around here oh
