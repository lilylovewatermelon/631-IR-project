sleepless nights and endless days
and all i do is promise to change my ways
leave the lights on you know
ill pretend youre on your way
you used to say that theres a time
we all deserve to lose our minds
so i lost my mind now im ready
to find my way hey hey

chorus
back home today to stay
the way you wished i would
and i swear to stay
the way you wished i would

verse 2
i dont know if im gonna have to redesign my mind
but tonight i made a wish and i sure hope that it comes true
cause its been too long without you its been too long

chorus
come home today to stay
the way you wished i would
and i swear to stay

even if i left it all behind
thered be reason to come back
and even though i left you far behind
always thought that youd come here
to find me come find me

verse 3
i dont know if i can wait this long
to be what i used to be
i dont think i can wait much longer for the tide
to come back to me

the way i wish you would
and i swear to stay
the way i wish you would

i swear to stay
the way i wish you would
