im godsent i know i’m godsent
i swear fore god
you know what im talkin’ bout
now i done overcame so much obstacles
came up from up under so much rocks and shit
even though i be out here schemin like a demon semen
i know im godsent
this gotta be god

verse 1
im godsent like he sent me up so i can relay these messages
like he use me as his vessel like he use me as an instrument
tryna locked me in a box they hate how god just keep on blessin me
they locked me in a box i pray to god this aint my destiny
i dont drink no lean i’m sippin’ on holy water like this my medicine
im a livin’ testimony every album like a testament
everything i went through made me who i am cause he be testin me
so im breakin’ bread with all my fam cause i dont take no ecstasy
i done sacrificed my niggas cause none of my niggas see the best in me
they want me slingin metal like the devil but im heavensent
my brother my mother them addicts fuck my daddy cause he neglected me
im 20 years old but i act like i been here before like im a veteran
he speak this shit through me like im a prophet but im a reverend
put my blood sweat and tears in all these lyrics cause this my exodus
im dyin so i can live so i can live i resurrected it
im dyin so i can live so i can live i resurrected it
