just a little rush babe to feel dizzy
to derail the mind of me
just a little hush babe my veins are busy
but my hearts in atrophy

prechorus
any way to distract and sedate
adding shadows to the walls of the cave

chorus
you and i nursing on a poison that never stung
our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
some whiff of this death and guts we are deaf we are numb
free and young and we can feel none of it

verse 2
somethin isnt right babe i keep catchin
little words but the meanings thin
im somewhere outside my life babe i keep scratchin
but somehow i cant get in

prechorus
so were slaves to any semblance of touch
lord we should quit but we love it too much
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus
sedated were nursing on a poison that never stung
our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
some whiff of this death and guts we are deaf we are numb
free and young and we can feel none of it

bridge
darlin dont you stand there watching
wont you come and save me from it
darlin dont you join in
youre supposed to drag me away from it

prechorus
any way to distract and sedate
adding shadows to the walls of the cave

chorus
you and i nursing on a poison that never stung
our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
some whiff this death and guts we are deaf we are numb
free and young and we can feel none of it
sedated were nursing on a poison that never stung
our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
some whiff of this death and guts we are deaf we are numb
free and young and we can feel none of it37embed"
