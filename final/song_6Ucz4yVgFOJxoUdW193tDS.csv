verse 1 50 cent  tony yayo
on ya mark get set lets go switch the flow
teach ya how to turn yayo into dough
the original don dada nobody bomb harder
ya heard what i said boy im hot im hot
the hoodrats they say he so crazy
the snitches they say he tried to spray me
but thats what you get for tryna play me
the aftermath of my wrath is so shady
no matter how hard you try you cant stop this
i catch ya stunting in the bentley coup√© cockpit
if you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket
front and find out how my p40 glock hit
50 you need some help chill yayo i got this
