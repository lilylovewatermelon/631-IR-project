another floor
a different ceiling than the night before
where am i while youre back home
life goes on and on and on and on

chorus
this strange routine sometimes weighs down on me
but i wouldnt trade it
not for anything

only this moment

verse 2
as cars pass by
live fast drive slow stay alive
where am i while youre back home
time goes on and on and on and on
