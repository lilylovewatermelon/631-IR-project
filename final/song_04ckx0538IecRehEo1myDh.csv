saw a man in the movies that didnt have a heart
how i wish i could give him mine
then i wouldnt have to feel it breaking all apart
and this emptiness inside would suit me fine

chorus
its times like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and id never even know
id give anything just to be the tin man
then i wouldnt have a heart and i wouldnt need a soul

verse 2
i couldnt see your leaving coming
it took me by surprise
and even now it still seems like a dream
but i know i cant be dreaming
cause as i lay down each night
the pain so great that it wont let me sleep

chorus
its times like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and id never even know
well id give anything just to be the tin man
and i wouldnt have a heart and i wouldnt need a soul
well id give anything just to be the tin man
and i wouldnt have a heart and i wouldnt miss you sosee kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeembed"
