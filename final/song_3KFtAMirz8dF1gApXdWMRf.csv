need more and more tainted misery
bleed battle scars chemical affinity
reign legacy innocence corrode
stain rot away catatonic overload

verse 2
choke asphyxia snuff reality
scorch kill the light incinerate celebrity
reaper butchery karma amputee
bloodline breeding fine death contagious deity

prechorus
hooked into this deceiver
need more and more
into the endless fever
need more and more

chorus
new consequence machine
burn through all your gasoline
asylum overtime nevermind
youve reached the end of the line
the end of the line

verse 3
time choke the clock steal another day
die faithfully narcissistic fade away
twisted jump the rail shout at the crowd below
breaker chase the ghost from latest high to all time low
see metallica liveget tickets as low as 66you might also likeprechorus
hooked into this deceiver
need more and more
into the endless fever
need more and more

chorus
new consequence machine
burn through all your gasoline
asylum overtime nevermind
youve reached the end of the line

bridge
drop the hourglass of time
spilling sand we will not find
as we gather here today
we bid farewell the slave becomes the master
the slave becomes the master
the slave becomes the master yeah

prechorus
the slave becomes the master
need more and more
right now and ever after
need more and more
chorus
new consequence machine
burn through all your gasoline
asylum overtime never mind
dead hourglass of time sand we will not ever find
we gather here today say goodbye
cause youve reached the end of the line

outro
the end of the line
the end of the line
the end of the line
youve reached the end of the line2embed"
