there was a world outside my door
i wasnt in touch with anymore
there was a way i used to feel
i knew what was and wasnt real
you built a bridge i tore it down
i felt safe on shaky ground
and i was a master of despair
making believe i didnt care

chorus
i shouldnt be standing here today
after all the crazy things ive done
im ready to fall and thats ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won

verse 2
out of a world turned upside down
it took some time to come around
out of a dream you made me whole
yes you did
you lit a fire down in my soul

chorus x2
i shouldnt be standing here today
after all the crazy things ive done
im ready to fall and thats ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
i shouldnt be standing here today
after all the crazy things ive done
im ready to fall and thats ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won

im ready to fall
i thought i knew what i was doing
i thought i was in control
i thought nobody could slow me down
but what did i know
i was just a kid a motherless child
no one to watch over me i was running wild
free of all responsibility till my life
and my love for myself caught up with me
yeah it caught up with me
and now im ready to fall yes i am
so readyembed"
