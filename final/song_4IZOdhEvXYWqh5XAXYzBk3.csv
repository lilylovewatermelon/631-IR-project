youre like waking in the morning by a mountain stream
youre like watching that eagle floating on the breeze
as i listen to you dreaming by my side
i wish i could call you mine

chorus
but you belong where the four winds blow
out where the untamed mustang roam
like a sweet summer rain passing through
never seen anything wild as you

verse 2
i could stay with you like this
til the day love dont exist
wildflowers bloom in an open field
and wither in a vase on a window sill

chorus
and you belong where the four winds blow
out where the untamed mustang roam
like a sweet summer rain passing through
never seen anything wild as you

bridge
theres a part of me that prays
that youll hang up your wings someday
but the part that truly does love you
always hopes you never do

cause you belong where your heart can be
out in the open wild and free
like a sweet summer rain passing through
i aint never seen anything wild as you

chorus
you belong where the four winds blow
out where the untamed mustang roam
like a sweet summer rain passing through
never seen anything wild as you

chorus
you belong where the four winds blow
out where the untamed mustang roam
like a sweet summer rain passing through
never seen anything wild as youembed"
