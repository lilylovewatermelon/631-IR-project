step up the two of us nobody knows us
get in the car like skrrt
staying up all night order me pad thai
then we gon sleep til noon

bubbles and bubbly ooh
this is a pleasure feel like we never
act this regular

dripdripdripped in gold
quick quick quick lets go
kiss me and take off your clothes

chorus
imagine a world like that
imagine a world like that
we go like up til im sleep on your chest
love how my face fits so good in your neck
why cant you imagine a world like that
imagine a world

verse 2
knew you were perfect after the first kiss
took a deep breath like ooh
feels like forever baby i never
thought that it would be you
tell me your secrets all of the creep shit
