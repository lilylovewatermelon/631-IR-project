i saw you downtown
through the glow of my taillights
you were stopped behind me
your car had caught my eye
im glad this lights slow
it give me a chance to catch my breath
right before i drive away to forget

chorus
why do i give a damn after everything went south
why do i write songs why cant my heart shut its mouth
why cant i move on and give a fair chance to someone new
why cant i fall out of love with you

verse 2
and ive tried pretty
i tried outgoing and fun
and ive tried intelligent
trust me i tried dumb
i tried wealthy
ive been looked at as a way out
ive tried everything i know to try out

chorus
and why do i give a damn after everything went south
why do i write songs why cant my heart shut its mouth
why cant i move on and give a fair chance to someone new
why cant i fall out of love with you
