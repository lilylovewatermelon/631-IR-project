why

verse 1
looking out across the nighttime
the city winks a sleepless eye
hear her voice shake my window
sweet seducing sighs
get me out into the nighttime
four walls wont hold me tonight
if this town is just an apple
then let me take a bite

chorus
if they say why why why why
tell them that its human nature
why why why why does he do me that way
if they say why why why why
tell them that its human nature
why why why why does he do me that way

verse 2
reaching out to touch a stranger
electric eyes are еverywhere
see that girl shе knows im watching
she likes the way i stare
