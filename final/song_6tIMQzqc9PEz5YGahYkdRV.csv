with the dawn i still go on dreaming of you
youre every thought youre everything youre every song i ever sing
summer winter scat and spring

thatd be spent in sweet content just dreaming away
when skies are grey when skies are blue
morning noon and nighttime too
all i do the whole day through is dream of you

instrumental break

when skies are grey even when theyre blue
