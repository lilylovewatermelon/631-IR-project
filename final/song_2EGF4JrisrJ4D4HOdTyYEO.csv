gravity dont mean too much to me im who ive got to be
these pigs are after me after you
run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
if we could run away run away from here

verse 1 gerard way
i got a bulletproof heart you got a hollowpoint smile
me and your runaway scars
got a photographed dream on the getaway mile
lets blow a hole in this town
and do our talking with a laser beam
gunnin out of this place in a bullets embrace
then well do it again

prechorus gerard way
how cant they say jenny could you come back home
cause everybody knows you dont ever wanna come back
let me be the one to save you

chorus gerard way
gravity dont mean too much to me im who ive got to be
these pigs are after me after you
run away like it was yesterday when we could run away
when we could run away run away from here
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likeguitar solo

verse 2 gerard way
im shootin out of this room
because i sure dont like the company
stop your preaching right there
cause i really dont care and ill do it again
so get me out of my head who wants to rock to rock to rock lets go
cause its getting kind of cramped you know who wants to rock to rock to rock lets go
coming ready or not when the motor gets hot who wants to rock to rock to rock lets go now
we can do it again

prechorus gerard way
the papers say johnny wont you come back home
cause everybody knows you dont wanna give yourself up
tell the truth and god will save you

chorus gerard way
gravity dont mean too much to me im who ive got to be
these pigs are after me after you
run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
if we could run away run away from here

bridge gerard way
and though i know how much you hate this oohooh
are you gonna be the one to save us
from the black and hopeless feeling
will you mean it when the end comes reelin
hold your heart into this darkness
will it ever be the light to shine you out
or fail and leave you stranded
i aint gonna be the one left standing
you aint gonna be the one left standing
we aint gonna be the ones left standing
chorus gerard way
gravity dont mean too much to me
is this our destiny
this world is after me after you
run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
run away run away run away from here

postchorus gerard way
yeah away from here
away from here33embed"
