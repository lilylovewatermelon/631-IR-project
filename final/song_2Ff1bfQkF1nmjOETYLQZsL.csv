im rich
like a hot noise
rich rich rich
ill take you out boy
so stuck up
i wish youd stick it to me
flesh ripped off

chorus
turning it
beating no beat
the walls are always speaking
no one no one no one no speaking at all

verse 2
she slipped
down a rot drink
well unzipped
she doesnt exist
so unloved
i took em standing up
so stuck up
ah

im rich
like a hot noise
rich rich rich
ill take you out boy
ill take you out boy

the walls are always speaking
no one no one no one no speaking at all
turning it
beating no beat
the walls are always speaking
no one no one no one no speaking at all
