verse 1
i forget all my dreams
i forget everyones name i meet
i forget about time and space
but i cant stop thinking bout your face
i cant stop thinking bout your face

verse 2
clouds are rolling by
i open my mouth and i breathe em right in
and all my thoughts slip away
but i cant stop thinking bout your face
i cant stop thinking bout your face

chorus
oh i wont stop
til you knock on my door
wont stop
til you knock on my door
ooh ooh
