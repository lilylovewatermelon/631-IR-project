words travel fast
so you spend all your time in your head
what’s the point in that
cause words never last
what you say now it’s not what you said
and i’m okay with that

you’re keeping yourself tied up
so you won’t let me down
didn’t you ever think just maybe

chorus
i’ll understand you
just give me the chance to
love you more than you’ll ever know
even if it means i gotta let you go
with or without me
baby you should be happy
if you’re heading down another road
don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
don’t let me be the last to know yeah
don’t let me be the last to know

verse 2
you take all i have
still i pour you a halfempty glass
what’s the point in that
and all i ever asked
is that you tell me when this is not enough
cause if it’s real love
you might also likechorus


verse 3
and maybe you’ll find what you really wanted
cause what you left behind and all your dreams are haunted
maybe i’ll move on or maybe i’ll just stay
either way
i hope you’ll understand me
if i say we can’t be
so if you wanna go
i want you to know

chorus
i’ll understand you
just give me the chance to
love you more than you’ll ever know
even if it means i gotta let you go
with or without me
baby you should be happy
if you’re heading down another road
don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
don’t let me be the last to know yeah
don’t let me be the last to know
don’t let me be the last to know1embed"
