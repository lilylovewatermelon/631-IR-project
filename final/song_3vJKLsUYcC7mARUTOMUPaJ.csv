verse 1 lil baby
ill make a scene for you
when you sleeping with me then your dreams come true
aint no limitations to things we do
we just kickin and now shеll be lovin me soon
i be straight to thе point aint no cut on a movie
fuckin her good all over the room
make her nut shell lay there she dont even move
i gotta go but im coming back soon
dont tell our business you know thats the rules
it feel good to tell someone to google you
i tell em chill cause i know what theyll do to you
i run atlanta get paid like im julio
we made a way from the streets to the studio
anyone feelin me thats who i do it for
you cant just pop out and say you the hero
you gotta put on a cape and save the day
shawty my type she aint got no stomach
look her dead in the face when im cummin
send a video and tell me she want it
just the other day i gave her some money
plead the fifth i aint making no comment
if it happened to them niggas we done it
too much shit to step for i cant be runnin
boy dont make me fly your bitch out the country

verse 2 lil baby
never lied to me when i asked you something
no matter what you just be real with me
a lot of shit come with a nigga like me
i just hope that you learn how to deal with me
i only be out with a couple of niggas
now shit bound to happen whenever we deep
i run with some hitters they run from a camera
and they wont even take a picture with me
the teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grow up i stood up and told her big meech
my mama aint have much and i wasnt good at no sports so you know i had fell to the streets
and i aint no chef boyardee but i get me a lil bit of food ima make sure we eat
and that shit be crazy how we used to swap our spit with each other we dont even speak
come with me well be gone for months
my lil shorty show her how to roll blunts
hit rodeo let her get what she like
drop a bag on her she get excited
tryna steal her heart im on a heist
i only trust her long as she in my sight
one thing she know we in this shit for life
