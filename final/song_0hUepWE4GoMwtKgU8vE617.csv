shawty bad slim thick

she dont stress she dont trip
and she fuck with all my bros

chorus eric bellinger
so if i gotta choose someone
then it must be her she been here since day one
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess we gon have to go hit london paris and montego bay
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess she gon have to scream my name
now every time that she come to the crib
ima break her back like i break that bank
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess ima have to call her bae
i guess ima have to call her bae
