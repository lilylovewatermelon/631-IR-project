i like your curls and i like your eyes
i look up at you and just see the sky
through streetlights i danced with my heaven at night
ooh ooh

chorus
i never knew what i felt like
but i feel like him more
because of you
because of you ooh
in the black and white
you paint the world
and i ask if colors knew
its cause of you
now love is true
because of you

verse 2
i like your heart and i like its size
if two hands are open would one intertwine
please be mine

chorus
i never knew what i felt like
but i feel like him more
because of you
because of you ooh
in the black and white
you paint the world
and i ask if colors knew
its cause of you
now love is true
because of you
