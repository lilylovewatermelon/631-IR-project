my name is drizzy and i aint perfect
but i work hard so i deserve it
and i belong right where you see me
aint on the fence about it i aint mr feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions and im the one thatll feed it
but truly youre bad enough that yall dont even really need it
you could show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partyin drinkin what you get handed
with your virgin island tans all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it im not sure im comprehendin
but these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin screamin

chorus santigold
i got to be unstoppable
i got to be unstoppable
ayayayay you dont lie
ayayayay you dont lie
i got to be unstoppable
i got to be unstoppable
ayayayay you dont lie
ayayayay you dont lie

ahem my name is weezy im almost perfect
and i work harder than hard workin
bizarre circus thats when my bars surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im layin on my back im never backin down
so overstand me
i got a condo in miami and my doormat is always sandy
and i run louisiana but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in atlanta and i always wear a bandana
and when it comes down to stuntin you boys are just buntin
and im swingin for the fence your girl hangin from my dick
your girl singin to my shit like alalalollipop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
and she say i freak that pussy better
better than her gynecologist ho just
text me whenever you want some more dick
more dick old bitch young bitch
but i be like damn all i got is one dick

chorus santigold
i got to be unstoppable
i got to be unstoppable
ayayayay you dont lie
ayayayay you dont lie
bridge santigold
i got the talk the beat and bass
give me one ill take it make you lose your place
tell me iii can play so i speed up the pace
i break it break it you cant stop me in this rarace

chorus santigold
i got to be unstoppable
i got to be unstoppable
ayayayay you dont lie
ayayayay you dont lie
i got to be unstoppable
i got to be unstoppable
ayayayay you dont lie
ayayayay you dont lie
