tonight doesnt feel like it did last night
im feeling warm if inside
since i saw your face since i looked in your eyes
theres a change in this place
i think the love factors high

chorus
when the love factors high and two hearts collide
you dont even try and thats when youll find
the one that feels right one for all time
its hard to deny when the love factors high

verse 2
sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
and sometimes your back ends up against the wall
as i hold you close we dance in time
yeah i think i know the love factors high

chorus
when the love factors high and two hearts collide
you dont even try and thats when youll find
the one that feels right one for all time
its hard to deny when the love factors high
its hard to deny when the love factors highsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
