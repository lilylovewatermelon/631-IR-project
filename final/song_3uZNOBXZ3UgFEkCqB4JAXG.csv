verse 1
remember when you used to love me before i even was me
the way you used to hug me lick me suck me kiss me fuck me
i spent a lot of money on you i invest in your dreams
i aint ever fronted on you girl you know what that means
its all mine all mine all mine
she said its all mine
but somehow i knew she was a liar she was a liar
shes a liar shes a liar
am i tripping am i bugging
is it over tell me something
you dont call me no more who you fucking
tell me what it is tell me what i did

prechorus
where you go are you coming home
any time soon are you coming home

chorus
but i aint really tripping if you aint tryna come back
fuck that you can stay wherever you at
im sorry for talking crazy

i just wanna know why you playing games with my heart
couldve sworn that you swore never change from the start

tell me where the fuck would you be without me
im sorry for talking crazy
yes no maybe
dont do this to me baby

ive been selfish i cant help it
whole lotta years whole lotta tears
bullshit that you dealt with
but you let me and you left me
i really think that i wouldve made you my girl some day
oh but how foolish am i to think that youd have to wait
like you never had shit like you aint a bad bitch
that could get her ass kissed from a nigga mad rich
but im missing that lift rolling up a spliff girl the way your tongue twist
getting lifted tripping off dumb shit you the only one that could make me cum quick
you know please tell me i love you please tell me
i hope please tell me he fucked up too

but when youre in love with someone
you come running running back
