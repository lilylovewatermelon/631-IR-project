i wanna be forgotten
and i dont wanna be reminded

i wanna be beside her
she wanna be admired
you say please dont make this harder
no i wont yet

verse 1
oh dear is it really all true
did they offend us and they want it to sound new
top ten ideas for countdown shows
whose culture is this and does anybody know
i wait and tell myself life aint chess
but no one comes in and yes youre alone
you dont miss me i know

verse 2
oh tennessee what did you write
i come together in the middle of the night
oh thats an ending that i cant write
cause ive got you to let me down

chorus
i wanna be forgotten
and i dont want to be reminded
you say please dont make this harder
no i wont yet
i wanna be beside her
she wanna be admired
i said please dont make this harder
