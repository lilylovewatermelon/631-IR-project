my mind is a warrior my heart is a foreigner
my eyes are the color of red like a sunset
ill never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
be a true heart not a follower were not done yet

prechorus
and i see it in your movements tonight
if we should ever do this right
im never gonna let you down
no ill never let you down
now keep it on the down low
and ill keep you around so ill know
that ill never let you down
ill never let you down

chorus
youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
now youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down down

my eyes are a river filler this drink is a liver killer
my chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend
your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again

prechorus
now i see it in your movements tonight
if we should ever do this right
im never gonna let you down
no ill never let you down
now keep it on the down low
and ill keep you around so ill know
that ill never let you down
ill never let you down

chorus
youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down
bridge
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
and ill never let you down

ill pick your feet up off of the ground
and never ever let you down17embed"
