well now all i battle is your ego and your pride
its ticking like a time bomb ready to ignite

when the smoke clears
what will be left for us but tears and pain
why must we argue over the same things
just to make up and go back again

and take a look at whats goin on

its time for lovin
when we gonna wake up my baby
before its too late
when we gonna wake up baby
its time for lovin
when we gonna wake up my baby

when we gonna wake up baby
its time for lovin
when we gonna wake up my baby
before its too late
