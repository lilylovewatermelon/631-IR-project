verse 1
uh mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
alohas to women with no ties to men
that i know well that way there are no lies
you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
im on the brink of influential im here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas
its december 31st and we in miami just meditating
you got your resolutions we just got reservations
living out a dream it feels like i stayed up
and we just want to party patron straight up
fuck that old shit im on new things
ovo clique red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
whod have thought the route wed chosen
would ever end up this scenic
i can relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time
that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike
but got to ai him for your survival
damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous
cause we want to be them and they want to be us yeah
so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
that you take for granted yyou can thank me now
and oh my goodness youre welcome youre welcome
at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them
get back to where they fell from
but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
yeah thats how you know its going down
in case another chance never comes around

yyou could thank me now thank me now uh go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its uhokay you could thank me now you you you

verse 2
uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think im spending all my time with the wrong women
i think ill have a chance at love and knowing me ill miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion
over double pump lattes and low fat muffins
do i or is missing what we had out of the question
im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroes
who was there before it all i guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons but focus on your pros
and love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
but those same ones from your area will grow into women
that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allowed where are they all now
i know theyre somewhere watching
so im trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning youll find it next to me
they tell me im the hottest guess we finally get to see
im feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
thats probably why im in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it–
im sorry
poolside drinking margarita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
im the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
im in a world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and im aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while im still here in this position
chorus
yyou could thank me now thank me now uh go head go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said what i said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its uhokay you could thank me now you you you
its a okay okay29embed"
