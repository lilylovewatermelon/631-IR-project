girl the way you broke my heart
it shattered like a rock through a window
i thought we had it so good
never really saw this comin

chorus
oh why you got to be so cold
why you got to go and cut me like a knife
and put our love on ice
oh girl you know you left this hole
right here in the middle of my soul
ohoh oh why you got to be so cold

verse 2
what am i supposed to say
if anybody asks me about you
i guess ill tell em im without you
how am i supposed to live
when i built my life around you
try to put yourself in my shoes

chorus
oh why you got to be so cold
why you got to go and cut me like a knife
and put our love on ice
