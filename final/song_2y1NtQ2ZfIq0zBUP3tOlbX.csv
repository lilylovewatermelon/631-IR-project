i spent months gazing at him
sitting cross the hall
his dark hair his glasses
perfect overall
he looked so serious
he was mysterious
one tuesday he caught me sneaking in a stare
he shot me a smile
i nearly tumbled out my chair
he said who are you my name is james
and thats when i fell into the flames

chorus
turns out hes a fool
that james
oh james
oh how i wasted my days
oh dreaming dreaming of james

verse 2
he said do you like museums
theyre open late tonight
how about we go together
just you and i
and maybe we can have a drink or two
id like to learn about you
but james just thought
it was alright
to go ahead and talk
about himself all night
then he really felt he had to say
that hed be a millionaire one day

turns out hes a fool
that james
oh james
oh how i wasted my days
oh dreaming dreaming of james

outro
my eyes rolled to the back of my head
it seemed like the night would never end
at one point i just stopped listening
his voice just became too sickeningembed"
