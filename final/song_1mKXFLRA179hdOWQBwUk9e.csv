right from the start
you were a thief you stole my heart
and i your willing victim
i let you see the parts of me
that werent all that pretty
and with every touch you fixed them

prechorus pnk
now youve been talking in your sleep
oh oh things you never say to me
oh oh tell me that youve had enough
of our love our love

chorus pnk
just give me a reason
just a little bits enough
just a second were not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again
its in the stars
its been written in the scars on our hearts
were not broken just bent
and we can learn to love again

verse 2 nate ruess pnk
im sorry i dont understand
where all of this is coming from
i thought that we were fine
oh we had everything
your head is running wild again
my dear we still have everything
and its all in your mind
