seventeen the only way i had a car
is after i dropped my mama off where she needed to go
four bald tires with the ceiling fallin and the window stuck
but the only thing i cared about was the radio
wed turn it on turn it up to ten and everybody would jump on in

chorus
riding down the highway
who wants to be the dj
ill find a spot on the side of the road
you find something on the radio
like a feel real good song
well know it when it comes on
didnt have no money no place to go
all we needed was a radio

verse 2
id grab my girl wed look for somewhere to watch the stars
the perfect place to put it in park and take it slow
shed sing along to even the ones that she barely knew
she still sounded good a little out of tune but we didnt care
id look at her shed look at me ill never forget that melody

chorus

shhh hey yall be quiet
thats my favorite song
hey man turn it up loud
come on come on come on

riding down the highway
who wants to be the dj
ill find a spot on the side of the road
you find something on the radio
like a feel real good song
well know it when it comes on
didnt have no money no place to go
all we needed was a radio

outro
all we needed all we needed now
was a was a was a radio1embed"
