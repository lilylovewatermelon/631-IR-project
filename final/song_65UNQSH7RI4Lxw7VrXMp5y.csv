lives an old germans daughter
on the banks of the old river rhine
there i loved her and left her
now i cant forget her
she was my pretty fraulein

fraulein fraulein look up toward the heavens
each night when them stars start to shine
by the same stars above you
i swear that i love you
you are my pretty fraulein

when my memories wander away over yonder
to the sweetheart that i left behind
in a moment of glory
her face comes before me
the face of my pretty fraulein

fraulein fraulein look up towards the heavens
each night as the stars start to shine
by the same stars above you
i swear that i love you
you are my pretty fraulein
you are my pretty frauleinsee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
