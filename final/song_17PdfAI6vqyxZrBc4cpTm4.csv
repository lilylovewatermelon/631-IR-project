repeating in my head betrayal
repeating in my head insecurities
repeating in my head diffidence
its not your fault
the well of thought and trust has run dry
dont be afraid to let go
dont be afraid to start over when its over
let go let go let go let go

verse 1
let go of feelings let go of compromise
hollow trunk for shelter so dark and cold inside
i always seem to find myself alone
jaded shell of being porous as a stone

prechorus
calloused rigid empty because of you

verse 2
let go of trusting lost thought for family
let go of living no more concerns of demise
i never seem to find rhythm for lifes harmony
contorted twisted broken without a reason

prechorus
calloused rigid empty because of you

its all me all you are
without me theres nothing else theres no one
brainwash all you are
without me youre by yourself theres no one

verse 3
hope is out of season
lost sight no hint of light
get busy livin or get busy dyin

prechorus
calloused rigid empty because of you

chorus
its all me all you are
without me theres nothing else theres no one
brainwash all you are
without me youre by yourself theres no one

bridge
save me this loss
closure my answer so grant it
you owe me all that you are
without me youre nothing youre no one
terrified petrified nothing youre no one
do you care because i dont
nothing youre no one
nobody cares so just go
nothing youre no one
by yourself all alone
chorus
its all me all you are
without me theres nothing else theres no one
brainwash all you are
without me youre by yourself theres no one

outro
save me this loss
closure my answer so grant it
you owe me all that you are
without me youre nothing1embed"
