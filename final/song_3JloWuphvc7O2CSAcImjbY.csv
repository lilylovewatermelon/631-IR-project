yeah im rough around the edges
on the surface i aint perfect
still need a little smoothing out
its hard to shift gears
after years of going one way
and one day turning around
like water tanks barns and rusted junk cars
get saved by a coat of paint
it takes somebody like you
to make a sinner like me
wanna try to be a little more saint

chorus
cause good bourbon is hard to put down
that high road is hard to stay on
that good book its hard to pick up
that old me is hard to turn off
girl ive been trying like hell
might be getting ahead of myself
but the longer i love you the morе i know
some habits aint meant to be brokе
no no no no no

verse 2
yeah habits like lying next to you
like making you laugh
like filling up a wall full of photographs
like learning how to listen
red light quick kissin
sunday morning amen third pew forgivin
like hometown walkin
me nothin talkin
together every sunset to sundown
like through the house dancin
them hardwoods catching
our clothes falling to the ground
see cole swindell liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
good bourbon is hard to put down
that high road is hard to stay on
that good book its hard to pick up
that old me is hard to turn off
girl ive been trying like hell
might be getting ahead of myself
but the longer i love you the more i know
some habits aint meant to be broke
oh no no

bridge
yeah a mans gotta know
when its time to let go
what hes gotta outgrow and cant
and as long as its you that i dont gotta lose
then everything else i can

chorus
yeah good bourbon is hard to put down
that high road is hard to stay on
that good book its hard to pick up
that old me is hard to turn off
girl ive been trying like hell
might be getting ahead of myself
but the longer i love you the more i know
some habits aint meant to be broke
outro
yeah some habits aint meant to be broke
like loving you
like loving youembed"
