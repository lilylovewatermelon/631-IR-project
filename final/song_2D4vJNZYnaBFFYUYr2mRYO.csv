coke and pepsi finally found a compromise
how can they complain that were all fucked up kids
when they keep on changing who our mother is

like it all you want its fruitless
night is in the way of progress

retinas are bleeding for the enterprise
surgically wired into paradise
yesterday i dropped in at the mkb
everyone was messaging like it was going out of style
it was just the cynic in me
god i love communicating
i just hate the shit were missing

everybody join in the magnificence
yes everything is absolutely making sense
every time you turn around your soul gets sold
to the highest bidder
then they turn around and merger and they merger
and the merger and they murder and they murder
the one who murders most will take it all

fight it all you want its useless
night is in the way of progress
you might also likewere gonna take your cities one by one
catch your cables cut your cords and spoil all your fun
were gonna make your life a living hell
cause stripped of your equipment youll be forced to face yourself

wire cutters of the world
you know what to use it for
spread the word to all the tightrope walker boys and girls
brace yourself for miracles
youre in for a nasty shock
when the war is over
you can read the paper
when the war is over
you can read the paperembed"
