i dont read yeah i just guess
as the world turns
dont bring me with your mess

verse 2
im trying to do my best
get my head up out the stress
when the money turns the world
your loving turns to less

verse 3
i learn by mistakes
most of it is yours and
im done living life as a criminal
and i thought id die young just to please the old
now i teach the young im vitriol

the war in me makes a warrior
like a pitbull getting with a terrier
im better off in north korea
yeah dropping from a barrel of a carrier

verse 5
coz i got enough to be more
its hard enough to get more
i shut the door on everything
just to let my head blow
coz i got enough to be more
its hard enough to get more
i shut the door on everything
just to let my head blow

verse 6
picture this a dull grey street in the way
neon signs gonna shine though
shorty you gonna shine though
come up on ya treasure trove
let the sun explode
check up in the paper
in the mirror for ya horoscope

verse 7
walking on a tightrope
go for something i dont even know
where to get it from
sending out a signal
smoke from a gun blow
as i knock off knock off
things that i dont want
