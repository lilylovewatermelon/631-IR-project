ugh every bitch im fuckin say they only fuckin me
i even bought you diamonds put you in that double c
the way you love the game you couldnt be in love with me
i work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
so how can i trust you trust you
when all the rich niggas fucked you fucked you
make you my baby id love to love to
you was a dime but i dubbed you dubbed you
when i first bagged you that shit had me excited
swimming in that pussy girl i swear theres nothing like it
i got plans to cut you off i know that you wont like it
i knew that it would come to this i seen it like a psychic
turned you to a savage savage
i wont forget you you a bad bitch bad bitch
i set you up so you could level up level up
but you was used to being average average
jumpin on jets you was caught up in the life
they gassed you on instagram you caught up in the hype
a ho gon be a ho so aint no use for no advice
when you crossed me you lost me cant let you cross me twice

chorus
i almost fell in love with a thottie oh
my dawg said you got too many bodies ooh
girl that pussy had me like a zombie oh
i gotta pour out my feelings thats inside me yeah
what happened in the dark is gon come to the light come to the light
magic from the start you was fuckin me right fuckin me right
treat me like a king baby talk to me nice talk to me

ass so fat arched up from the back
i still watch all our old videos
and i still hear that pussy callin callin

and from the way you treated me almost went all in all in
had to check your mileage and i started stallin stallin
cause relationships turn into situationships

my heart cant play with this no
gotta save myself before i try to save a bitch woah

had to patek my wrist protect my heart
because this cold game left my heart cold now i promise it aint my fault

chorus
i almost fell in love with a thottie oh
my dawg said you got too many bodies ooh
girl that pussy had me like a zombie oh
