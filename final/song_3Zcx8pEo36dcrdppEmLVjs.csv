we cant go back

cant go back we cant
we cant go back

cant go back we cant

breathe in and out calm down

well would you do it again again
and count backwards from ten
look i dont make those mistakes no more
sometimes i swear i can see straight through you
just concentrate control
but would you do it again again

we cant go back
