you say it every day now
i know i get spaced out in a conversation
yeah its been a hard year
you say that i dont hear all the words youre saying
and it makes you miss me even when youre with me
feels like somethings broken
i know ive been acting easily distracted
you wish i could focus

chorus
you think that i dont notice
how you brush your hair out of your green eyes
the way you blush when you drink red wine
the way you smile when you try to bend the truth
you think that i dont notice
all the songs you sing underneath your breath
you still tear up at a beach sunset
and you dance just like youre the only one in the room
you think that i dont notice but i do
i do yeah i do yeah

verse 2
at that party last night
baby i dont know why i forgot to mention
you were looking dropdead not even a contest
center of attention
if i had to say every time you looked amazing
youd think i was joking
but i brag about you when im not around you
you dont even know it
