all across the universe
for all of us to see
theres no room for both of us
part ways at sea

verse 1
i grew up in the woods
with nobodys help
build my own fort in the trees
to keep to myself

interlude
i want to be erased
from life if youre still there

chorus
all across the universe
for all of us to see
theres no room for both of us
part ways at sea

verse 2
i would wait for you to come
a puppet you see
lose my eyes under your couch
i can see but i cant hear
you might also likeinterlude
i want to be erased
from life if youre still there
it hurts me to know
how small i really am

outro
kept me safe from evil things
sheltered me from this world1embed"
