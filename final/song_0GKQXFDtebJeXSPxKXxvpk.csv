its a mystery night
like a sawedoff shotgun
in the morning light it comes to anyone
all the strings that follow you
and the things theyre tied to
my loves behind you
colored by the snow
the shine is gone

prechorus
i used to know what made you wet
now im searching for it
cause its a mystery all the same
now to get you back

chorus 1
on holiday
with a broken camera
and all i say
is i could be happier
i could be happier

verse 2
its a mystery night
and i thought we had fun
but in the morning light
your cars already gone
do the things i wanna do
not the ones im supposed to
why cant i get close to
the man i saw in me
when i was young

on holiday
with a broken camera
and all i say
is i could be happier
and all i say
is i could be happier

verse 3
i run away im free
from all the shadows that follow me
if all the branches are to break
resolve my faith
destiny and fate
cause i never wanna go away tonight
the cameras the camera
i never wanna open up my eyes
the cameras the camera

interlude
your cameras your camera

outro
cause i never wanna go away tonight
i never wanna open up my eyes2embed"
