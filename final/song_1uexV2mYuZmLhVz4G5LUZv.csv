i dance around this empty house
tear us down throw you out
screaming down the halls
spinnin all around and now we fall

prechorus 1
pictures framing up the past
your taunting smirk behind the glass
this museum full of ash
once a tickle now a rash

chorus
this used to be our funhouse
but now its full of evil clowns
its time to start the countdown
im gonna burn it down down down
im gonna burn it down

postchorus
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one fun

verse 2
echoes knockin on locked doors
all the laughter from before
id rather live out on the street
than in this haunted memory
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeprechorus 2
ive called the movers called the maids
well try to exorcise this place
drag my mattress to the yard
crumble tumble house of cards

chorus
this used to be our funhouse
but now its full of evil clowns
its time to start the countdown
im gonna burn it down down down
this used to be our funhouse
but now its full of evil clowns
its time to start the countdown
im gonna burn it down down down
im gonna burn it down down down down

postchorus
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one fun
down down down

ill find a new place
