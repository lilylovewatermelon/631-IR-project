hope when you take that jump you dont fear the fall
hope when the water rises you built a wall
hope when the crowd screams out its screaming your name
hope if everybody runs you choose to stay
hope that you fall in love and it hurts so bad

i saw so many places the things that i did

and when that sun goes down hope you raise your cup
i wish that i could witness all your joy and all your pain
but until my moment comes ill say
