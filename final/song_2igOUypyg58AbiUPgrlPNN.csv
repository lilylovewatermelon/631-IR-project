yeah whoa

verse 1
gunfire left a hole in the tank losing gasoline
fire is on my trail and hes after me
hope it dont get here before i get where im goin
i gotta get where im goin
take off my mask to breathe
you couldve been a part of a masterpiece
fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
thats the thing

prechorus
where im goin i dont need my brakes brakes
cant wait to see your face
when your front windows break
and i come crashing through

chorus
the lovers needa clear the road
oh oh
cause this thing is ready to blow
oh oh
i just wanna set you on fire
so i wont have to burn alone
then you
then youll know where im comin from
fire bomb
fire bomb

seems cold but baby no it doesnt have to be
microwaving our metal tragedy
watching it burn and its beautiful and its blue
and its pitiful when its through its the other half of me
i didnt do it you lit the match for me
now were flying from the blast baby
thats the thing

prechorus
where were going we dont need no brakes brakes
cant wait to see your face
when your front windows break
and i come crashing through

chorus
the lovers needa clear the road
oh oh
cause this thing is ready to blow
oh oh
i just wanna set you on fire
so i wont have to burn alone
then you
then youll know where im coming from
fire bomb
fire bomb
bridge
baby we were killin em
they couldnt handle the millionth degree
we were criminals
cause we were burning the world called the police
fire department ambulance
you can call me crazy
cause i believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

chorus
the lovers needa clear the road oh oh
cause this thing is ready to blow oh oh
i just wanna set you on fire
so i wont have to burn alone
then you then youll know where im comin from
