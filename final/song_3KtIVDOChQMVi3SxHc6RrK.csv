another day has gone im still all alone
how could this be youre not here with me
you never said goodbye someone tell me why
did you have to go and leave my world so cold

prechorus
every day i sit and ask myself how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says

chorus
that you are not alone i am here with you
though youre far away i am here to stay
but you are not alone i am here with you
though were far apart youre always in my heart
but you are not alone

postchorus
lone lone why
lone

verse 2
just the other night i thought i heard you cry
asking me to come and hold you in my arms
i can hear your prayers your burdens i will bear
but first i need your hand then forever can begin
you might also likeprechorus
every day i sit and ask myself how did love slip away
something whispers in my ear and says

chorus
that you are not alone i am here with you
though youre far away i am here to stay
but you are not alone i am here with you
though were far apart youre always in my heart
but you are not alone

bridge
oh whisper three words and ill come runnin fly
and girl you know that ill be there
ill be there

chorus
you are not alone i am here with you
though youre far away i am here to stay
but you are not alone i am here with you
though were far apart youre always in my heart
that you are not alone you are not alone
i am here with you i am here with you
though youre far away
though youre far away you and me
i am here to stay
but you are not alone i am here with you
you are always in my heart
though were far apart youre always in my heart
for you are not alone not aloneembed"
