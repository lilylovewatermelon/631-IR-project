see all those people on the ground wasting time
i try to hold it all inside but just for tonight
top of the world sitting here wishing
the things ive become but something is missing
maybe i fuck what do i know

verse 2
and now it seems that i have found nothing at all
want to hear your voice out loud slow it down slow it down
without it all im choking on nothing
its clear in my head that im screaming for something
knowing nothing is better than knowing it all

chorus

without it all im choking on nothing
its clear in my head im screaming for something
