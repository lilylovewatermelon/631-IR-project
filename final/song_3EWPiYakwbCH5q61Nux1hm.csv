oh yeah

verse 1 joey livio
i was so lonely until i met you babe
you were the reason and i wanted you to stay
now it seems so long and youre back again
you were my first love youll always be the one
you light my darkness and
and youre brighter than the sun
im alive when youre in my world baby

chorus livio with sarah
id love to promise you my heart
i never want to be apart
without your love without your love
my lonely soul is left behind
just say you love me one more time
cos i would never last a day id fade away
without your love

verse 2 livio joey
give me a reason and ill be there for you
give me a sweet smile
just to make my dreams come true
cause youre everything
youre the song i sing
all the joy you bring to my world baby
