hold me down under the water
you know well that i cant swim
im not tryna be a martyr
know that i wont let you in
safe and warm inside myself
but you need more than someone else

chorus
you need space you need time
you take yours and ill take mine
come closer so i can be the one to push
its not me its just you
it doesnt mean shit when it falls through come closer
so i can be the one to push you
the one to push

verse 2
hold me tight enough to kill me
bite my tongue so i cant speak
clip my wings so i cant fly
bury me deep but i wonâ€™t die
was it worth it worth it worth it

chorus
you need space you need time
you take yours and ill take mine
come closer closer so i can be the one to push
its not me its just you
it doesnt mean shit when it falls through come closer closer
so i can be the one to push you push you
the one to push you push you

guess i needed you enough not to notice
guess i wanted you enough to lie
you wear so many faces i should have known it
but that sure was a beautiful disguise

chorus
you need space you need time
you take yours and ill take mine
come closer so i can be the one to push
its not me its just you
it doesnt mean shit when it falls through come closer closer
so i can be the one to push you push you
yeah
the one to push you push you
the one to push you

outro
put our game in the past
we make love and we attack let me hold you
so you can be the one to push back7embed"
