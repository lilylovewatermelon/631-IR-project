la la la… yeah
la la la la la la la la… uh huh
ooh i’d lie for you baby
ooh i’d die for you baby
i like the way that feel

preverse 50 cent
i’ll build you but if ever i fall down
and i need you to pick me up
promise me you’ll be around
hold me down i’ll build you up

verse 1 50 cent
listen if you let me i’ll be the reason you shine
it’s the secret i want the world to know that you’re mine
but on some real shit communications could be better
so i’m writing this song instead of a love letter
they gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
i figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
i wanna get to know you and be the reason you smile
girl you know where i’m from you know how i get down
when times get tough tell me that i’m special
not rap i mean me that i’m special
you know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
precious stones could you put me before them
if so i’ll see to it they always around
nothing but the best now how does that sound
if i drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
girl you on my mind all the time that’s a secret
see 50 cent liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus jamie foxx
baby i build you up
girl if i know for sure i have you by my side
i’d build you up
girl i need to know for sure you’re mine
i need to know for sure
girl if i know for sure i have you by my side
i’d build you up
girl i need to know for sure you’re mine

verse 2 50 cent
i thinkin’ ’bout you thinkin’ that you feel the same way
or is it just my imagination that get runnin’ away
if you ready to ride girl c’mon let’s roll
g55 fly ma let’s go
it’s hard to measure the pleasure of havin’ you in my presence
your smile makes me smile i’ll show you my style
you can shop a little bit i’ll pick out some shit
one pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
for better or worse like whitney and bobby
if you wanna play house we can play house then
but wait why pretend when you can move in
before i be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
girl it’s more than lust i want your trust
you keep it real with me i keep it real with you
cause i know with you by my side there’s nuttin i can’t do yeah
chorus jamie foxx
baby…
girl if i know for sure i have you by my side
i’d build you up
girl i need to know for sure you’re mine
build you up baby when you’re down
girl if i know for sure i have you by my side
cuz your smile like a frown yes i will
i’d build you up
girl i need to know for sure you’re mine
i’m gon’ build you up baby
