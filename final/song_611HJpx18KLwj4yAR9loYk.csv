would you be mine would you be my baby tonight
could be kissin my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
cause i like you quite a lot everything you got dont you know
its you that i adore though i make the boys fall like dominoes

prechorus
kiss me in the dark dark tonight
dark do it my way
kiss me in the park park tonight
park let them all say

chorus
hey lolita hey hey lolita hey

no more skippin rope skippin heartbeats with the boys downtown
just you and me feelin the heat even when the sun goes down
