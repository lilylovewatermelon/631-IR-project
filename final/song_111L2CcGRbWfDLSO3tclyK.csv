im a ghost on the radio
a needle on the vinyl
a country boy survival
the bottom of a bottle yeah
i’m the fightin side of you and me
and my hearts down in tennessee

chorus
and i sing songs about freight trains and prisons
heartaches and honkytonks
cowboys and outlaws
goodhearted women
in boots and straw hats
all gone just like that
they can’t even recognize me
they used to call me country

verse 2
used to have cool names like willie and waylon
merle and hank
we all stood together
we sang and we drank
chased the white lines
night after night
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus
singin songs about freight trains and prisons
heartaches and honkytonks
and cowboys and outlaws
goodhearted women
in boots and straw hats
all gone just like that
they cant even recognize me
they used to call me country

verse 3
like an old violin
put away and never played again
paycheck and cash
naw they aint comin back

chorus
they did songs about freight trains and prisons
heartaches and honkytonks
cowboys and outlaws
goodhearted women
in boots and straw hats
all gone just like that
they cant even recognize me
they used to call me country
outro
they used to call me country
im a thing of the past
im a ghost on the radioembed"
