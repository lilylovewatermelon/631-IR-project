im flying high up on the bird acrophobiac
i slick caught her eyeing down my purse
where the dollars at
i let her know the rents due on the first
they can call the hearse
cause if theres any violation i go off with that
catwalk slick talk flirting with a big dog
why i need his millis when i got billy on the speed dial
you know im on that meow quick to scratch your eyes out
strutting on the court make them nervous call a timeout

bridge miley cyrus
the plane boss the plane
â€˜bout to get that big rock
slip that on my hand
make that media big talk
the plane boss the plane
psych that must be the purple
got up in my brain
