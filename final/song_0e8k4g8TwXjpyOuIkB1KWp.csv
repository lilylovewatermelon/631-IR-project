baby drop what your doing
lets jump off this merrygoround
i dont know if were coming or going
same old same old bringing me down
ive had it up to here with this rat race
were just wasting time not tasting life

chorus 1
id rather be sitting on the beach
watching the sun come up
running my fingers through your hair
as you lay there all curled up
looking at me with that give me one more kiss
love doesnt get any better than this look on your face

chorus 2
id reach down and pull you up and wed head that sailboat out to sea
chart our course for
anywhere the wind blows anyplace we see
our sails anchoring down
loving the night away
waiting on the light of another perfect day

verse 2
i want a little sand between my toes
the sunshine on your face
but todays the perfect day
