comes a snow storm you can get a little heat
comes love nothing can be done
comes a fire then you know just what to do
blow a tire you can buy another shoe
comes love nothing can be done
don’t try hidin
cause there isn’t any use
you’ll start slidin
when your heart turns on the juice
comes a headache you can lose it in a day
comes a toothache see the dentist right away
comes love nothing can be done

comes a heat wave you can hurry to the shore
comes a summons you can hide behind the door
comes love nothing can be done
comes the measles you can quarantine the room
comes a mousie you can chase it with a broom
comes love nothing can be done
that’s all brother
if you’ve ever been in love
that’s all brother
you know what i’m speaking of
comes a nightmare you can always stay awake
comes depression you may get another break
comes love nothing can be doneyou might also likeembed"
