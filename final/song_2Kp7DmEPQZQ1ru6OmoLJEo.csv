in a dark wintry tokyo
in the mahjong parlor he waits
severed past running through his hands
glory comes to the one who waits
in the hallways theyre lying there
in the red blossom of the days
in your arms there is nothing left
who you are is run away

chorus
my whole life is the mystery that i cant break
our aims is a calvary of our mistakes
i would love to heal you now

verse 2
in a dark wintry tokyo
in the mahjong parlours they wait
severed past weaving through their hands
glory comes to the ones that wait
in the art of the arm
red blossom of the days

outro
all i wanted to see is that i am better
all i want to believe is that i am better
round and round
all i want you to see is that i am better
round and roundyou might also like1embed"
