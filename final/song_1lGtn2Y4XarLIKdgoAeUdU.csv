i like the way your face looks when youre smilin like a vandal
wakin up warm with you in a room thats too cold for us to handle
and in this shack im livin in you dont mind sleepin in
eatin food leftover from last night
theres plenty of boys that want you babe
but for me you will crawl scratch and fight
well go out on saturday and ride the bronco through the bay
sit and drink cerveza by the shore
youll tell me you love me girl
even if im wrecked lonely and poor

chorus
so dont give up on me
you dont care where im buyin
your ring

verse 2
girls today will drink all day to fall in love with any boy they see
youre a sight of utmost beauty utmost strength and utmost loyalty
so ill sit here and drink all night
talk about the lords delight in you
if my mama could just see you laugh
i know that she could see the shine in you
shed say thanks for takin care of her baby boy cause she cant be here
and hug you til your little lungs turn blue

no i wont give up on youembed"
