when we first came here
we were cold and we were clear
with no colours on our skin
we were light and paper thin
and when we first came here
we were cold and we were clear
with no colours in our skin
until we let the spectrum in

prechorus
say my name
and every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again

chorus
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again

and when we come for you
well be dressed up all in blue
with the ocean in our arms
kiss your eyes and kiss your palms
and when its time to pray
well be dressed up all in grey
with metal on our tongues
and silver in our lungs

prechorus
say my name
and every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again

chorus
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
bridge
and when we come back well be dressed in black
and youll scream our names aloud
and we wont eat and we wont sleep
well drag bodies from the ground

refrain
so say my name
and every colour illuminates
and we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
say my name
as every colour illuminates

chorus
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again

outro
say my name
we are shining
say my name
say my name
and we will never be afraid again17embed"
