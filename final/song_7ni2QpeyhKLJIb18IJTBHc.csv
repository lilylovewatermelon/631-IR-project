verse 1
theres a birthday party happenin upstairs where
and its all for me who the fuck cares fuck it
they wont notice if i never go and show my face face
they just lookin for a reason they can celebrate thats okay
i hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me tasty
i tell the same stories they pretend they never heard em boring
ill just stay down here inside the studio uhhuh
doin blow and paraphrasin the crucible witch
if you fuckin with the god thats a funeral kill em
lose your soul im witcha longer than your student loans woah
who got the ecstasy pills i need a few to roll raw
im a real drug addict homie you should know
somebody please tell jimmy to put the pistol down stop man please please please please

happy birthday thanks
how the fuck you feel good
do you ever sit and wonder what is real huh
do you ever reach to touch her but theres nothin there there
do you tell her that you love her but she doesnt care care
does she tell you that you hurt her and youre unaware no
did you hear about a heaven now you runnin there go
do you think about the fantasy and makebelieve okay
do you cover up your eyes you cant wait to see look
lately ive been havin strange dreams uhhuh
paranoid they hate me everybody think im crazy
baby can you take me somewhere where the sky blue uhhuh
