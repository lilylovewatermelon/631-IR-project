dreamin i was only dreamin
of another place and time where my familys from
singin i can hear them singin
when the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
dyin everyones reminded
hearts are washed in misery drenched in gasoline
laughter there is no more laughter
songs of yesterday now live in the underground

interlude
ooh oohooh

verse 1
life before the lobotomy

signed my love a lost memory
from the end of the century

chorus

to cast a stone and throw a brick
but when the sky is falling down
you burned your dreams into the ground
