the world is spinning too fast
im buying lead nike shoes
to keep myself tethered
to the days ive tried to lose
my mama said to slow down
you must make your own shoes
stop dancing to the music
of gorillaz in a happy mood

prechorus 2d
keeping my groove on
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump
oh yeah
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump

get the cool shoeshine
get the cool
get the cool shoeshine
get the cool
get the cool shoeshine

theres a monkey in the jungle
watching a vapor trail
caught up in the conflict
between its brain and its tail
and if times elimination
then we got nothing to lose
please repeat the message
its the music that we choose

prechorus 2d
keeping my groove on
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump
oh yeah
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump
they do the bump

interlude
okay bring it down here
we goin back out
