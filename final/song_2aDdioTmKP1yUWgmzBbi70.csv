yung germ

verse
war crimes might drop napalm on the jects
dirtbags lay your lil homeboy to rest
shotgun on me he shouldve wore a vest
if i go to jail scream free me til the death
acting like a ho strip a nigga out his clothes
takin his amiris and paranorman foams
i see where you at got them uav drones
payin off the crackheads walkin round ya home

chorus
dont get cut do not rush up
dont get put do not rush up
dont get touched do not rush up
dont get fucked do not rush upyou might also like2embed"
