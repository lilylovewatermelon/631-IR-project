i thought that was your voice
i thought that was my car
now we aint ever met before
but i know who you are
youre living in my house
and im living in a tent
and dont laugh this second job of mine
is paying both our rents
youre out here buying happy meals
and im eating rice and pintos
you so much as crack a smile at me man
ill come through this here window

chorus
well you took my wife
and you took my kids
and you took that life
that i used to live
my pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat
yeah i think thats just about everything
oh i almost forgot
do you want fries with that

verse 2
your ketchups in the bag
and a check is in the mail
i hope your chickens raw inside
and i hope your bun is stale
im supposed to tell you
please come back
but how about this instead
i hope you both choke on a pickle
man that would tickle me to death
i dont know what youre waiting on
youre holding up the line
oh man you aint got no change coming back
are you out of your mind
