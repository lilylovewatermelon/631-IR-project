verse 1 lick loth
still here boasting my emotions
now coping while fucking dopeless
let the dope hit breathing slowly
look baby ill show you hopeless
load the ammo carecrow no shadow
bloody pianos soldout gallows
my mind so harrowed from tragic backroads traveled
waking up with dread pop off on my meds nose deep in narcotics
window shopping for my fathers problems
do you have some options
my hand numb from gripping the pistol trigger finger callous
my heart out to my girl i know that loving me is a challenge
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebreak

verse 2 lil oozing
garbage what im spewing sluggish how im moving
dope is what im choosing if you ask me how im doing
i be cruising coasting using dosing
just dont overdue it hoping i dont fucking lose it
rope in hand i tied the noose its open
another night blacked out lying on the bathroom floor
i aint gonna back out i aint gonna lash out
i guarantee ill have some more
ima dive into the void head first
aint tryna avoid said thirst im tryna enjoy death
worst things about me
constantly doubting the fact that im blessed by a curse
outro
i feel like i hit rockbottom and another trap door opened and i plunged further into despair
god only gives us as much suffering as we can endure
i mean pile us on the shit to see if well break why
to test our faith and to make us appreciate the good that we do have
well forgive me for saying so reverend but god is a sick fuck6embed"
