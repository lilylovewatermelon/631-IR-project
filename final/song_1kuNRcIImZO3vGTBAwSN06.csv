i am alice im in wonderland
wheres the rabbit he is late again
goodness gracious i cant wait for him
who has got the time
round and round and round and round we go
its just like the same scenario
good for nothing feels like somethin aint right

hook jhene aiko
i might
i mightve got way too high

verse 2 jhene aiko
i am trippin i keep slippin i cannot recognize
whats the difference in pretending and living a real lie
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
everything is spinnin now
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
have you seen the ground

hook jhene aiko
i might
i mightve got way too high

verse 3 absoul
break it down roll it up
mountains and valleys seashells from sally
ego removed but still in tune exactly
pride set aside third eye winking at me
my what a ride real trippy shit
i glimpse with a squint but i can see a whole grip
my retinas red my vision is crystal
didnt use pencil but its true i led
my way to this sedated state of mind i always tread
my daddy did it this is the state of mind i always had
im mad he died before we got to have a man to man
i got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams
so i take a deep breath puff puff pass
pardon my paranoia im just a product of my past
i show you how to let your soul sail
sparking lala talking to allah
might of got way too high

i mightve got way too high88embed"
