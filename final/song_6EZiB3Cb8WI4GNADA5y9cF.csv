im bringing back ghosts
that are no longer there
im getting hard on myself
sitting in my easy chair
well theres three people in the mirror
and im wondering which one of them i should choose
well i cant keep from laughing
spitting out these 300 mile per hour outpour blues

verse 2
im breaking my teeth off
trying to bite my lip
theres all kinds of redheaded women
that i aint supposed to kiss
and its that color which never fails
to turn me blue
so i just swallow it and hold on to it
and use it to scare the hell out of you

verse 3
i have a woman
says come and watch me bleed
and im wondering just how i can do that
and still give her everything that she needs
well theres three people in my head that have the answer
and one of them has got to be you
but youre holding tight to it the answer
singing these three hundred mile per hour outpour blues
you might also likeverse 4
put on gloves a tied scarf and wrap up warm
on this winter night
every time you get defensive
youre just looking for a fight
its safe to sing somebody out theres got a problem
with almost anything youll do
well next time they stab you dont fight back just play the victim
instead of playing the fool

verse 5
and the roads are covered with a million
little molecules
of cigarette ashes and the school floors are covered
with pieces of pencil eraser too
well sooner or later the grounds gonna be holding all
of my ashes too
but i cant help but wonder if after im gone will i still have these three hundred mile per hour finger breaking no answers making battered dirty hands bee stung and busted up empty cup torrential outpour blues

outro
one things for sure in that graveyard
im gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes5embed"
