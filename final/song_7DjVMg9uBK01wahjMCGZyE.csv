driving the highway with nothing to do
future fading away
the stereo pumping metallica tunes
ride the lightning oh yeah
the car might be stolen my clothes smell like dirt
born to ramble and play
play with fire drunk and denial
always in for a fight

chorus
ive been in the dark side of town
theyre bringing me in
they call me the wild rover of hell
i´m fighting for nickels and
a dime for the rules i always break
see all the blood ive spilled ill still be the haunted

verse 2
stitching my wounds like rambo for fanden
damage complete and done
some had the better and some had the worse
walk a mile in quicksand
spending the last buck on whiskey and beers
oh how clever i am
the dice keep on tumbling my will still unbroken
but how long will it last

ive been in the dark side of town
theyre bringing me in
they call me the wild rover of hell
i´m fighting for nickels and
a dime for the rules i always break
see all the blood ive spilled ill still be the haunted

bridge
im fighting them all big or small my friend
just show me the dollars
i end up losing it all again
repeating the story

verse 1
driving the highway with nothing to do
future fading away
the stereo pumping metallica tunes
ride the lightning oh yeah
the car might be stolen my clothes smell like dirt
born to ramble and play
play with fire drunk and denial
always in for a fight

ive been in the dark side of town
theyre bringing me in
they call me the wild rover of hell
i´m fighting for nickels and
a dime for the rules i always break
see all the blood ive spilled ill still be the hauntedembed"
