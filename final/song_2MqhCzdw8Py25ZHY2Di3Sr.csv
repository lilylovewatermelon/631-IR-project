chorus lady gaga
dont want your jewels i want your drugs
dont want your money want your love
dont want your jewels i want your drugs
want your jewels i want your drugs
dont want your money want your love

verse 2 lady gaga
i admit that my habits expensive
and you may find it quite offensive
but i wont die at the hands of another
im your mother sister your father brother
this family is stupid attractive
if youve surveyed the way weve acted
keep it comin im comin around like your friend now
i think you should shut up and sit down

chorus lady gaga
dont want your jewels i want your drugs
dont want your money want your love
dont want your jewels i want your drugs
want your jewels i want your drugs
dont want your money want your love

verse 3 too hort
everybody want that money what you want
high as hell tryna have some fuckin fun
i dont need em but the diamonds make it shine shine
tried to kick it just cant find the time
its the middle of the week this aint even the weekend
red carpet events every time you see pimps
its good pussy in the passenger seat
my lil homies hang with me i be passin em freaks bitch
bridge lady gaga
jewels and drugs play that hustle
smother em if you wanna be bad
slap honey on a young pancake
we know how to make that money
jewels and drugs play that hustle
smother em if you wanna be bad
aint nothin if it aint family
we know how to make that money

verse 4 twista
come and show me the gateway into your love
i feel like the money can never do it like the club
and i feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
and i want it so come on and take it with me so that i can hit it
i can admit it im influenced by desire when i approach her
i try to provoke her by givin money and jewelry and accessories
instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin her to another place when i get it
hold up
twista be goin in warp speed breakin atoms
blowin og has got me creating antimatter
let her pop it and smoke on it with me now i got her
because she be ready to party and then move to the club yes
because you know the way i think is an anomaly
and ima be strange as lady gaga
probably a dollar be the business
but id rather be in an outer dimension when i be talkin about jewels and drugs
outro lady gaga
jewels and drugs play that hustle
smother em if you wanna be bad
slap honey on a young pancake
we know how to make that money
jewels and drugs play that hustle
smother em if you wanna be bad
aint nothin if it aint family
we know how to make that money19embed"
