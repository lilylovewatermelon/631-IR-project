learning is indeed a very great and a very material accomplishment and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding but learning yet i do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do as herillus the philosopher for one who therein places the sovereign good and maintained that it was only in her to render us wise and contented which i do not believe no more than i do what others have said that learning is the mother of all virtue and that all vice proceeds from ignorance which if it be true required a very long interpretation my house has longbeen open to men of knowledge and is very well known to them for my father who governed it fifty years and upwards inflamed with the new ardour with which francis the first embraced letters and brought them into esteem with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men receiving them into his house as persons sacred and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors for my part i love them well but i do not adore them amongst others peter bunel a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time having with some others of his sort staid some days at montaigne in my fathers company he presented him at his departure with a book entitled theologia naturalis sive liber creaturarum magistri raimondi de sebonde and as the italian and spanish tongues were familiar to my father and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of spanish with latin terminations he hoped that with a little help he might be able to understand it and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him which was when the novel doctrines of luther began to be in vogue and in many places to stagger our ancient belief wherein he was very well advised wisely in his own reason foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism for the vulgar not having the faculty of judging of things suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence such as those wherein their salvation is concerned and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws or the reverence of the ancient customs as a tyrannical yoke

           nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum
           for with most eagerness they spurn the law
          by which they were before most kept in awe
resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees and given their particular consent

it happened that my father a little before his death having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers commanded me to translate it for him into french it is good too translate such authors as this where there is little but the matter itself to express but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at are dangerous to attempt especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom it was a strange and a new undertaking for me but having by chance at that time nothing else to do and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was i did it as well as i could and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed which after his death was done

i found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed and his design full of piety and because many people take a delight to read it and particularly the ladies to whom we owe the most service i have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it his design is bold and daring for he undertakes by human and natural reasons to establish and make good against the atheists all the articles of the christian religion wherein to speak the truth he is so firm and so successful that i do not think it possible to do better upon that subject nay i believe he has been equalled by none this work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known and of whom all that we know is that he was a spaniard practising physic at toulouse about two hundred years ago i enquired of adrian turnebus who knew all things what he thought of that book who made answer that he thought it was some abstract drawn from st thomas daquin for that in truth his mind so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety was alone capable of such thoughts be this as it may whoever was the author and inventor and tis not reasonable without greater certainty to deprive sebond of that title he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts

the first thing they reprehend in his work is that christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace in which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect this were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me who know nothing of it nevertheless i conceive that in a thing so divine so high and so far transcending all human intelligence as is that truth with which it has pleased the bounty of god to enlighten us it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance as a very extraordinary favour and privilege to conceive and imprint it in our understanding and i do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it for if they were so many rare and excellent souls and so abundantly furnished with natural force in former ages could not have failed by their reason to arrive at this knowledge tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion but withal i do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which god has endowed us to the service of our faith it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to and that there is not a design in a christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief we do not satisfy ourselves with serving god with our souls and understandings only we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence and apply our limbs and motions and external things to do him honour we must here do the same and accompany our faith with all the reason we have but always with this reservation not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge if it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion if it enters not only by reason but moreover by human ways it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour and yet i am afraid we only have it by this way

if we hold upon god by the mediation of a lively faith if we hold upon god by him and not by us if we had a divine basis and foundation human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery the love of novelty the constraint of princes the success of one party and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy

                as a great rock repels the rolling tides

            that foam and bark about her marble sides
           from its strong bulk
if we were but touched with this ray of divinity it would appear throughout not only our words but our works also would carry its brightness and lustre whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light we ought to be ashamed that in all the human sects there never was any of the faction that did not in some measure conform his life and behaviour to it whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish christians by the name will you see the proof of this compare our manners to those of a mahometan or pagan you will still find that we fall very

short there where out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others and that it should be said of us are they so just so charitable so good then they are christians all other signs are common to all religions hope trust events ceremonies penance

martyrs the peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue as it is also the most heavenly and difficult and the most worthy product of truth for this our good st louis was in the right who when the tartar king who was become christian designed to come to lyons to kiss the popes feet and there to be an eyewitness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner immediately diverted him from his purpose for fear lest our disorderly way of living should on the contrary put him out of conceit with so holy a belief and yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other who going to rome to the same end and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption and in so vicious hands if we had but one single grain of faith we should remove mountains from their places saith the sacred word our actions that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity would not be merely human they would have in them something of miraculous as well as our belief brevis est institutio vit honest beauque si credos believe and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not others more in number make themselves believe that they believe not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe we think it strange if in the civil war which at this time disorders our state we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner which is because we bring nothing to it but our own justice which is in one party is only there for ornament and palliation it is indeed pretended but tis not there received settled and espoused it is there as in the mouth of an advocate not as in the heart and affection of the party god owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion not to our passions men there are the conductors and therein serve themselves with religion whereas it ought to be quite contrary observe if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures from a rule in itself so direct and firm when and where was this more manifest than in france in our days they who have taken it on the left hand they who have taken it on the right they who call it black they who call it white alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs conduct it with a progress so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends doubtful and hard to believe did one ever see come from the same school and discipline manners more united and more the same do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them accord—as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms
this so solemn proposition whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion do you remember in whose mouths the last year the affirmative of it was the prop of one party and the negative the pillar of another and hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that we condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity and how much worse does france than say it let us confess the truth whoever should draw out from the army even that raised by the king those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country or for the service of their prince could hardly out of both these put together make one complete company of gensdarmes whence does this proceed that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions and that we see them one while move but a footpace and another run full speed and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness and another by their coldness gentleness and slowness but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations according to the variety wherein they move

i evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions

there hostility so admirable as the christian our zeal performs wonders when it seconds our inclinations to hatred cruelty ambition avarice detraction and rebellion but when it moves against the hair towards bounty benignity and temperance unless by miracle some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it we stir neither hand nor toot our religion is intended to extirpate vices whereas it screens nourishes and incites them we must not mock god if we believed in him i do not say by faith but with a simple belief that is to say and i speak it to our great shame if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history or as we would do one of our companions we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him—at least he would go equal in our affection with riches pleasure glory and our friends the best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour his kinsman or his master is there any understanding so weak that having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures and on the other in equal knowledge and persuasion the state of an immortal glory would change the first for the other and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt for what lust tempts us to blaspheme if not perhaps the very desire to offend the philosopher antisthenes as he was being initiated in the mysteries of orpheus the priest telling him that those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death—if thou believest that answered he why dost thou not die thyself diogenes more rudely according to his manner and more remote from our purpose to the priest that in like manner preached to him to become of his religion that he might obtain the happiness of the other world—what said he thou wouldest have me to believe that agesilaus and epaminondas who were so great men shall be miserable and that thou who art but a calf and canst do nothing to purpose shalt be happy because thou art a priest did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse we should not have death in so great horror

          non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur
          sed magis ire foras stemque relinquere ut angais
         gauderet prealonga senex aut cornua cervus

          we should not on a death bed grieve to be
           dissolved but rather launch out cheerfully
          from our old hut and with the snake be glad
           to cast off the corrupted slough we had
          or with th old stag rejoice to be now clear
           from the large horns too ponderous grown to bear
i desire to be dissolved we should say and to be with jesus christ the force of platos arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for

all this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion by our own hands and no otherwise than as other religions are received either we are happened in the country where it is in practice or we reverence the antiquity of it or the authority of the men who have maintained it or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers or are allured by its promises these considerations ought tis true to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only for they are human obligations another religion other witnesses the like promises and threats might by the same way imprint a quite contrary belief we are christians by the same title that we are perigordians or germans and what plato says that there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power does not concern a true christian tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation what kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us a pleasant faith that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it can a vicious passion such as inconstancy and astonishment cause any regular product in our souls they are confident in their judgment says he that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave the terror of death by the horror of that future condition inspires them with a new belief and by reason that such impressions render them timorous he forbids in his laws all such threatening doctrines and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods excepting for his great good when they happen to him and for a medicinal effect they say of bion that infected with the atheism of theodoras he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt but that death surprising him he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of bion plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of god either by reason or by force atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding how arrogant soever there are men enough seen out of vanity and pride to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions and outwardly to affect the profession of them who if they are such fools have nevertheless not the power to plant them in their own conscience yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily reunite and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples a doctrine seriously digested is one thing and those superficial impressions another which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy miserable and senseless men who strive to be worse than they can

the error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth let this great soul of plato but great only in human greatness fall also into this other mistake that children and old men were most susceptible of religion as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness the knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations from our reasons and passions but from a divine and supernatural constraint having but one form one face and one lustre which is the authority of god and his divine grace now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them he has in his stupendous works left the character of his divinity and tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it tis what he himself is pleased to tell us that he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker it were to do wrong to the divine goodness did not the universe consent to our belief the heavens the earth the elements our bodies and our souls—all things concur to this we have but to find out the way to use them they instruct us if we are capable of instruction for this world is a sacred temple into which man is introduced there to contemplate statues not the works of a mortal hand but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense the sun the stars the water and the earth to represent those that are intelligible to us the invisible tilings of god says st paul appear by the creation of the world his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works

          and god himself envies not men the grace
          of seeing and admiring heavens face
           but rolling it about he still anew
           presents its varied splendour to our view
          and on oar minds himself inculcates so
           that we th almighty mover well may know
         instructing us by seeing him the cause
            of ill to revcreoce and obey his laws
now our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter the grace of god is the form tis that which gives fashion and value to it as the virtuous actions of socrates and cato remain vain and fruitless for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things so is it with our imaginations and discourses they have a kind of body but it is an inform mass without fashion and without light if faith and grace be not added thereto faith coming to tinct and illustrate sehonds arguments renders them firm and stolid and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions and of being the first guides to an elementary christian to put him into the way of this knowledge they in some measure form him to and render him capable of the grace of god by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief i know a man of authority bred up to letters who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by sebonds arguments and should they be stripped of this ornament and of the assistance and approbation of the faith and be looked upon as mere fancies only to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents

           si melius quid habes arcesse vel imperium fer
               if you have arguments more fit
            produce them or to these submit
let them admit the force of our reasons or let them show us others and upon some other subject better woven and of finer thread i am unawares half engaged in the second objection to which i proposed to make answer in the behalf of sebond some say that his arguments are weak and unable to make good what he intends and undertake with great ease to confute them these are to be a little more roughly handled for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions to an atheist all writings tend to atheism he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom these have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish sebonds reasons as to the rest they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human whom in her majesty full of authority and command they durst not attack the means that i shall use and that i think most proper to subdue this frenzy is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance to make them sensible of the inanity vanity and vileness of man to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the divine majesty tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain that alone that can make a true estimate of itself and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon —greek— god permits not any being but himself to be truly wise let us subdue this presumption the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit deus superbis resistit humilibus autem dal gratiam god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble understanding is in the gods says plato and not at all or very little in men now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted let us see then if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of sebond that is to say if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason for st augustin disputing against these people has good cause to reproach them with injustice in that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish and to show that a great many things may be and have been of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments wherein men confess they see nothing and this he does as all other things with a curious and ingenious inquisition we must do more than this and make them know that to convince the weakness of their reason there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it that to it the easy and the hard are all one that all subjects equally and nature in general disclaim its authority and reject its mediation

what does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy when she so often inculcates to us that our wisdom is but folly in the sight of god that the vainest of all vanities is man that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is and that man who is nothing if he thinks himself to be anything does seduce and deceive himself these sentences of the holy spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which i would maintain that i should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority but these will be whipped at their own expense and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself

let us then for once consider a man alone without foreign assistance armed only with his own proper arms and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom which is all his honour strength and the foundation of his being let us see how he stands in this fine equipage let him make me understand by the force of his reason upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience can any thing be imagined so ridiculous that this miserable and wretched creature who is not so much as master of himself but subject to the injuries of all things should call himself master and emperor of the world of which he has not power to know the least part much less to command the whole and the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it the only one who can return thanks to the architect and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world who i wonder sealed him this patent let us see his commission for this great employment was it granted in favour of the wise only few people will be concerned in it are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour and being the worst part of the world to be preferred before the rest shall we believe this man—for whose sake shall we therefore conclude that the world was made for theirs who have the use of reason these are gods and men than whom certainly nothing can be better we can never sufficiently decry the impudence of this conjunction but wretched creature what has he in himself worthy of such an advantage considering the incorruptible existence of the celestial bodies beauty magnitude and continual revolution by so exact a rule

                   cum suspicimus mni clestia mundi
            templa super stellisque micantibus arthera fiium
            el venit in mcntem lun solisque viarurn

                  when we the heavenly arch above behold
            and the vast sky adorned with stars of gold
            and mark the reglar course that the sun
            and moon in their alternate progress run

considering the dominion and influence those bodies have not only over our lives and fortunes

           facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab aatris

           mens lives and actions on the stars depend
but even over our inclinations our thoughts and wills which they govern incite and agitate at the mercy of their influences as our reason teaches us

                contemplating the stars he finds that they
          rule by a secret and a silent sway
           and that the enamelld spheres which roll above
           do ever by alternate causes move
           and studying these he can also foresee
           by certain signs the turns of destiny
seeing that not only a man not only kings but that monarchies empires and all this lower world follow the influence of the celestial motions

                 how great a change a little motion brings
            so great this kingdom is that governs kings
if our virtue our vices our knowledge and this very discourse we are upon of the power of the stars and the comparison we are making betwixt them and us proceed as our reason supposes from their favour

                  one mad in love may cross the raging main
           to level lofty ilium with the plain
           anothers fate inclines him more by far
           to study laws and statutes for the bar
           sons kill their father fathers kill their sons
          and one armd brother gainst another runs
           this wars not theirs but fates that spurs them on
         to shed the blood which shed they must bemoan
           and i ascribe it to the will of fate
           that on this theme i now expatiate
if we derive this little portion of reason we have from the bounty of heaven how is it possible that reason should ever make us equal to it how subject its essence and condition to our knowledge
whatever we see in those bodies astonishes us qu molitio qua ferramenta qui vectes qu machina qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt what contrivance what tools what materials what engines were employed about so stupendous a work why do we deprive them of soul of life and discourse have we discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity we who have no commerce with them but by obedience shall we say that we have discovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul what have we seen any thing like the sun does he cease to be because we have seen nothing like him and do his motions cease because there are no other like them if what we have not seen is not our knowledge is marvellously contracted qu sunt tant animi angusti how narrow are our understandings are they not dreams of human vanity to make the moon a celestial earth there to fancy mountains and vales as anaxagoras did there to fix habitations and human abodes and plant colonies for our convenience as plato and plutarch have done and of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray not so much from a necessity of erring but from a love of error
the corruptible body stupifies the soul and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination
presumption is our natural and original disease the most wretched and frail of all creatures is man and withal the proudest he feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe in the lowest story of the house the most remote from the heavenly arch with animals of the worst condition of the three and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon and bringing the heavens under his feet tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to god attributes to himself divine qualities withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures cuts out the shares of the animals his fellows and companions and distributes to them portions of faculties and force as himself thinks fit how does he know by the strength of his understanding the secret and internal motions of animals—from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them when i play with my cat who knows whether i do not make her more sport than she makes me we mutually divert one another with our play if i have my hour to begin or to refus she also has hers plato in his picture of the golden age under saturn reckons among the chief advantages that a man then had his communication with beasts of whom inquiring and informing himself he knew the true qualities and differences of them all by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence and led his life more happily than we could do need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts this great author was of opinion that nature for the most part in the corporal form she gave them had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time the defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us why may it not be in our part as well as theirs tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another—for we understand them no more than they do us and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them tis no great wonder if we understand not them when we do not understand a basque or a troglodyte and yet some have boasted that they understood them as apollonius tyanaus melampus tiresias thales and others and seeing as cusmographers report that there are nations that have a dog for their king they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions we must observe the parity betwixt us have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning and so have beasts of ours—much about the same they caress us threaten us and beg of us and we do the same to them

as to the rest we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves and that they perfectly understand one another not only those of the same but of divers kinds

              the tamer herds and wilder sort of brutes
          though we of higher race conclude them mutes
          yet utter dissonant and various notes
          from gentler lungs or more distended throats
           as fear or grief or anger do them move
          or as they do approach the joys of love
in one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger of another sort of bark he is not afraid even in the very beasts that have no voice at all we easily conclude from the society of offices we observe amongst them some other sort of communication their very motions discover it

                as infants who for want of words devise
            expressive motions with their hands and eyes
and why not as well as our dumb people dispute argue and tell stories by signs of whom i have seen some by practice so clever and active that way that in fact they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood lovers are angry reconciled intreat thank appoint and in short speak all things by their eyes

               even silence in a lover
          love and passion can discover
what with the hands we require promise call dismiss threaten pray supplicate deny refuse interrogate admire number confess repent fear express confusion doubt instruct command incite encourage swear testify accuse condemn absolve abuse despise defy provoke flatter applaud bless submit mock reconcile recommend exalt entertain congratulate complain grieve despair wonder exclaim and what not and all this with a variety and multiplication even emulating speech
with the head we invite remand confess deny give the lie welcome honour reverence disdain demand rejoice lament reject caress rebuke submit huff encourage threaten assure and inquire
what with the eyebrows—what with the shoulders there is not a motion that does not speak and in an intelligible language without discipline and a public language that every one understands whence it should follow the variety and use distinguished from others considered that these should rather be judged the property of human nature i omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need—the alphabets upon the fingers grammars in gesture and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed and the nations that pliny reports have no other language an ambassador of the city of abdera after a long conference with agis king of sparta demanded of him well sir what answer must i return to my fellowcitizens that i have given thee leave said he to say what thou wouldest and as much as thou wouldest without ever speaking a word is not this a silent speaking and very easy to be understood

as to the rest what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals is there a polity better ordered the offices better distributed and more inviolably observed and maintained than that of bees can we imagine that such and so regular a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation

              hence to the bee some sages have assignd
           some portion of the god and heavenly wind
the swallows that we see at the return of the spring searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest do they seek without judgment and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose without discretion and in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round of an obtuse than of a right angle without knowing their properties and effects do they bring water and then clay without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds and place their lodgings against the east without knowing the different qualities of the winds and considering that one is more wholesome than another why does the spider make her web tighter in one place and slacker in another why now make one sort of knot and then another if she has not deliberation thought and conclusion we sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us and how unable our art is to imitate them we see nevertheless in our rougher performances that we employ all our faculties and apply the utmost power of our souls why do we not conclude the same of them

why should we attribute to i know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art wherein without being aware we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature with maternal gentleness and love accompany and learn them as it were by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation at the same time denying us the means of being able by any instruction or effort of understanding to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts so that their brutish stupidity surpasses in all conveniences all that our divine intelligence can do really at this rate we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother but it is nothing so our polity is not so irregular and unformed

nature has universally cared for all her creatures and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being for the common complaints i hear men make as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds and then again depresses them to the antipodes that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth tied and bound not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells husks bark hair wool prickles leather down feathers scales or silk according to the necessities of their being has armed them with talons teeth or horns wherewith to assault and defend and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them to swim to run to fly and sing whereas man neither knows how to walk speak eat or do any thing but weep without teaching

               like to the wretched mariner when tossd
         by raging seas upon the desert coast
          the tender babe lies naked on the earth
         of all supports of life stript by his birth
         when nature first presents him to the day
         freed from the cell wherein before he lay
           he fills the ambient air with doleful cries
          foretelling thus lifes future miseries
            but beasts both wild and tame greater and less
           do of themselves in strength and bulk increase
            they need no rattle nor the broken chat
            ay which the nurse first teaches boys to prate
            they look not out for different robes to wear
            according to the seasons of the year
           and need no arms nor walls their goods to save
            since earth and liberal nature ever have
          and will in all abundance still produce
         all things whereof they can have need or use
these complaints are false there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes our ancient gauls were but slenderly clad any more than the irish our neighbours though in so cold a climate but we may better judge of this by ourselves for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it the face the feet the hands the arms the head according to the various habit if there be a tender part about us and that would seem to be in danger from cold it should be the stomach where the digestion is and yet our forefathers were there always open and our ladies as tender and delicate as they are go sometimes halfbare as low as the navel neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary and the lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members without any ligature at all our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves as to the custom of eating it is in us as in them natural and without instruction

for every one soon finds his natural force
which he or better may employ or worse
who doubts but an infant arrived to the strength of feeding himself may make shift to find something to eat and the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity without other culture and artifice and if not at all times no more does she do it to beasts witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year the late discovered nations so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink without care or without cookery may give us to understand that bread is not our only food and that without tillage our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of nay it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present now that we have added our own industry

                 the earth did first spontaneously afford
           choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board
           with herbs and flowrs unsown in verdant fields
          but scarce by art so good a harvest yields
            though men and oxen mutually have strove
           with all their utmost force the soil t improve
the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it

as to arms we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do if some beasts surpass us in this advantage we surpass many others and the industry of fortifying the body and covering it by acquired means we have by instinct and natural precept that it is so the elephant shows who sharpen and whets the teeth he makes use of in war for he has particular ones for that service which he spares and never employs them at all to any other use when bulls go to fight they toss and throw the dust about them boars whet their tusks and the ichneumon when he is about to engage with the crocodile fortifies his body and covers and crusts it all over with closewrought and welltempered slime as with a cuirass why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron

as to speech it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary nevertheless i believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude remote from all society of men which would be an experiment very hard to make would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by and tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals for what is this faculty we observe in them of complaining rejoicing calling to one another for succour and inviting each other to love which they do with the voice other than speech and why should they not speak to one another they speak to us and we to them in how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs and they answer us we converse with them in another sort of language and use other appellations than we do with birds hogs oxen horses and alter the idiom according to the kind

                thus from one swarm of ants some sally out
           to spy anothers stock or mark its rout
lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech but laughter also and the difference of language which is seen amongst us according to the difference of countries is also observed in animals of the same kind aristotle in proof of this instances the various calls of partridges according to the situation of places

                 and various birds do from their warbling throats
          at various times utter quite different notes
          and some their hoarse songs with the seasons change
but it is yet to be known what language this child would speak and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance if a man will allege to me in opposition to this opinion that those who are naturally deaf speak not i answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear but rather because the sense of hearing of which they are deprived relates to that of speaking and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within and make it sound in our own ears before we can utter it to others

all this i have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things and to bring us back and join us to the crowd we are neither above nor below the rest all that is under heaven says the sage runs one law and one fortune

               all things remain
          bound and entangled in one fatal chain
there is indeed some difference—there are several orders and degrees but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature

              all things by their own rites proceed and draw
         towards their ends by natures certain law
man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity miserable creature he is not in a condition really to step over the rail he is fettered and circumscribed he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are and of a very mean condition without any prerogative of true and real preeminence that which he attributes to himself by vain fancy and opinion has neither body nor taste and if it be so that he only of all the animals has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts representing to him that which is that which is not and that he would have the false and the true tis an advantage dearly bought and of which he has very little reason to be proud for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him—sin sickness irresolution affliction despair i say then to return to my subject that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should by a natural and forced inclination do the same things that we do by our choice and industry we ought from like effects to conclude like faculties and from greater effects greater faculties and consequently confess that the same reasoning and the same ways by which we operate are common with them or that they have others that are better why should we imagine this natural constraint in them who experience no such effect in ourselves added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition and nearer allied to the divinity than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own the vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty and to enrich the other animals with natural goods and abjure them in their favour in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired very foolishly in my opinion for i should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those i had begged and obtained from education it is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of god and nature

for instance take the fox the people of thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river and turn him out before them to that purpose when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river down to the ice to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters current and according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness to retire or advance—have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions and that it is a ratiocination and consequence drawn from natural sense that that which makes a noise runs that which runs is not frozen what is not frozen is liquid and that which is liquid yields to impression for to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing without reason and consequence is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination we are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from and frustrate the enterprizes we plot against them

and if we will make an advantage even of this that it is in our power to seize them to employ them in our service and to use them at our pleasure tis still but the same advantage we have over one another
we have our slaves upon these terms the climacid were they not women in syria who squat on all fours served for a ladder or footstool by which the ladies mounted their coaches and the greatest part of free persons surrender for very trivial conveniences their life and being into the power of another
the wives and concubines of the thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husbands tomb have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion some of them moreover adding this necessity of accompanying them in death as well as life whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains the form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words we swear to suffer ourselves to be chained burnt wounded and killed with the sword and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master religiously engaging both body and soul in his service

                 uire meum si vis flamma caput et pete ferro
           corpus et iutorto verbere terga seca

                wound me with steel or burn my head with fire
            or scourge my shoulders with welltwisted wire
this was an obligation indeed and yet there in one year ten thousand entered into it to their destruction when the scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines his cupbearer the master of his horse his chamberlain the usher of his chamber and his cook and upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses mounted by fifty pages that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb the men that serve us do it cheaper and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks horses and dogs withal to what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these i do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem him from servitude they are fools said he tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me and they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them than to be served by them and withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion nor one horse to another for want of courage as we go to the chase of beasts so do tigers and lions to the chase of men and do the same execution upon one another dogs upon hares pikes upon tench swallows upon grasshoppers and sparrowhawks upon blackbirds and larks

                the stork with snakes and lizards from the wood
            and pathless wilds supports her callow brood
           while joves own eagle bird of noble blood
          scours the wide country for undaunted food
            sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away
           and feeds her nestlings with the generous prey
we divide the quarry as well as the pains and labour of the chase with our hawks and hounds and about amphipolis in thrace the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half as also along the lake motis if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught they presently go and tear his nets in pieces and as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force as springing hares and angling with line and hook there is also the like amongst other animals aristotle says that the cuttlefish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line which she extends and draws back at pleasure and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut lying herself concealed in the sand or mud and by little and little draws it in till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it

as to strength there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man we need not a whale elephant or a crocodile nor any suchlike animals of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men to do our business lice are sufficient to vacate syllas dictatorship and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm

why should we say that it is only for man or knowledge built up by art and meditation to distinguish the things useful for his being and proper for the cure of his diseases and those which are not to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody when we see the goats of candia when wounded with an arrow among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure and the tortoise when she has eaten a viper immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel the storks to give themselves clysters of seawater the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies and those of their companions but out of the bodies of their masters too witness the elephant of king porus whom alexander defeated the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient—why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason for to allege to their disparagement that tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us for the honour of so infallible a mistress chrysippus though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever considering the motions of a dog who coming to a place where three ways met either to hunt after his master he has lost or in pursuit of some game that flies before him goes snuffing first in one of the ways and then in another and after having made himself sure of two without finding the trace of what he seeks dashes into the third without examination is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog i have traced my master to this place he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways he is not gone this way nor that he must then infallibly be gone this other and that assuring himself by this conclusion he makes no use of his nose in the third way nor ever lays it to the ground but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason this sally purely logical and this use of propositions divided and conjoined and the right enumeration of parts is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from trapezuntius

animals are not incapable however of being instructed after our method we teach blackbirds ravens pies and parrots to speak and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables does evince that they have a reason within which renders them so docile and willing to learn everybody i believe is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs the dances where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word but i observe this effect with the greatest admiration which nevertheless is very common in the dogs that lead the blind both in the country and in cities i have taken notice how they stop at certain doors where they are wont to receive alms how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts even there where they have sufficient room to pass i have seen them by the trench of a town forsake a plain and even path and take a worse only to keep their masters further from the ditch—how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his masters safely only and to despise his own conveniency to serve him and how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man can all this be apprehended without ratiocination

i must not omit what plutarch says he saw of a dog at rome with the emperor vespasian the father at the theatre of marcellus this dog served a player that played a farce of several parts and personages and had therein his part he had amongst other things to counterfeit himself for some time dead by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat after he had swallowed a piece of bread which passed for the drug he began after awhile to tremble and stagger as if he was taken giddy at last stretching himself out stiff as if dead he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place as it was his part to do and afterward when he knew it to be time he began first gently to stir as if awaking out of a profound sleep and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators
the oxen that served in the royal gardens of susa to water them and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose to which buckets were fastened such as there are many in languedoc being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more but their task being performed they would suddenly stop and stand still we are almost men before we can count a hundred and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all

there is more understanding required in the teaching of others than in being taught now setting aside what democritus held and proved that most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals as by the spider to weave and sew by the swallow to build by the swan and nightingale music and by several animals to make medicines—aristotle is of opinion that the nightingales teach their young ones to sing and spend a great deal of time and care in it whence it happens that those we bring up in cages and which have not had the time to learn of their parents want much of the grace of their singing we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study and even amongst the wild it is not all and every one alike—every one has learnt to do better or worse according to their capacity and so jealous are they one of another whilst learning that they contention with emulation and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place the breath rather failing than the voice the younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes the disciple listens to the masters lesson and gives the best account he is able they are silent oy turns one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher  have formerly seen says arrian an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg and another fastened to his trunk at the sound of which all the others danced round about him rising and bending at certain cadences as they were guided by the instrument and twas delightful to hear this harmony in the spectacles of rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn and some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters
but this other story of the pie of which we have plutarch himself for a warrant is very strange she lived in a barbers shop at rome and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard it happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop after that and all the next day the pie was pensive dumb and melancholic which every body wondered at and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing but they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains stops and changes having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before

i will not omit this other example of a dog also which the same plutarch i am sadly confounding all order but i do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book which plutarch says he saw on board a ship this dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it
what is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity tis said that the ravens of barbary do the same when the water they would drink is too low this action is somewhat akin to what juba a king of their nation relates of the elephants that when by the craft of the hunter one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them and covered over with brush to deceive them all the rest in great diligence bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out but this animal in several other effects comes so near to human capacity that should i particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us i should easily have what i usually maintain granted namely that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man the keeper of an elephant in a private house of syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance
one day his master would himself feed him and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant casting an angry look at the keeper with his trunk separated the onehalf from the other and thrust it aside by that declaring the wrong was done him
and another having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner and filled it with ashes these are particular effects but that which all the world has seen and all the world knows that in all the armies of the levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants with whom they did without comparison much greater execution than we now do with our artillery which takes pretty nearly their place in a day of battle as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history

                  the sires of these huge animals were wont
          the carthaginian hannibal to mount
          our leaders also did these beasts bestride
           and mounted thus pyrrhus his foes defied
           nay more upon their backs they used to bear
         castles with armed cohorts to the war
they must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle where the least stop they should have made by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people had been enough to spoil all and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another they had the charge not of one simple movement only but of many several things to be performed in the battle as the spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the indies to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit in charging and retiring as occasion required and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies as they did ardour and fierceness

we more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation i had not else so long insisted upon these examples for i believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past i have formerly seen men brought hither by sea from very distant countries whose language not being understood by us and moreover their mien countenance and habit being quite differing from ours which of us did not repute them savages and brutes who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute ignorant of the french tongue ignorant of our salutations and cringes our port and behaviour from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example all that seems strange to us and that we do not understand we condemn the same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts they have several conditions like to ours from those we may by comparison draw some conjecture but by those qualities that are particular to themselves what know we what to make of them the horses dogs oxen sheep birds and most of the animals that live amongst us know our voices and suffer themselves to be governed by them so did crassuss lamprey and came when he called it as also do the eels that are found in the lake arethusa and i have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them

              they every one have names and one and all
         straightway appear at their own masters call
we may judge of that we may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms and fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun continue long in meditation and contemplation at certain hours of the days of their own motion without instruction or precept but because we do not see any such signs in other animals we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us as we discern something in this action which the philosopher cleanthes took notice of because it something resembles our own he saw he says ants go from their anthill carrying the dead body of an ant towards another anthill whence several other ants came out to meet them as if to speak with them where after having been a while together the last returned to consult you may suppose with their fellowcitizens and so made two or three journeys by reason of the difficulty of capitulation in the conclusion the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow as it were for the ransom of the defunct which the first laid upon their backs and carried home leaving the dead body to the others this was the interpretation that cleanthes gave of this transaction giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not nevertheless without intercourse and mutual communication whereof tis through our own defect that we do not participate and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure but they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that antony lost to augustus his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the latins call remora by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself and the emperor caligula sailing with a great navy upon the coast of romania his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish which he caused to be taken fastened as it was to the keel of his ship very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea the wind and the force of all his oars by being only fastened by the beak to his galley for it is a shellfish and was moreover not without great reason astonished that being brought to him in the vessel it had no longer the strength it had without a citizen of cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedgehog he has his burrow open in divers places and to several winds and foreseeing the wind that is to come stops the hole on that side which that citizen observing gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow the camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases according to occasion either to conceal himself from what he fears or from what he has a design to seize in the camlon tis a passive but in the polypus tis an active change we have some changes of colour as in fear anger shame and other passions that alter our complexions but it is by the effect of suffering as with the camlon it is in the power of the jaundice indeed to make us turn yellow but tis not in the power of our own will now these effects that we discover in other animals much greater than ours seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us as tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs of which no appearances have arrived at us

amongst all the predictions of elder times the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds we have nothing certain like it nor any thing to be so much admired that rule and order of the moving of the wing whence they derived the consequences of future things must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition without the intelligence consent and meditation of him by whom it is produced is an opinion evidently false that it is so the crampfish has this quality not only to benumb all the members that touch her but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them nay it is further said that if one pour water upon her he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand and stupefy the feeling through the water this is a miraculous force but tis not useless to the crampfish she knows it and makes use ont for to catch the prey she desires she will bury herself in the mud that other fishes swimming over her struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers may fall into her power cranes swallows and other birds of passage by shifting their abode according to the seasons sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty and put it in use huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best the best way is to refer the choice to the mother as thus take them and carry them out of the kennel and the first she brings back will certainly be the best or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire that one she first catches up to save by which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have

the manner of coming into the world of engendering nourishing acting moving living and dying of beasts is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes and add to our own condition above theirs can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason for the regimen of our health physicians propose to us the example of the beasts manners and way of living for this saying out of plutarch has in all times been in the mouth of these people keep warm thy feet and head as to the rest live like a beast

the chief of all natural actions is generation we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end nevertheless we are ordered by lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual—

                more ferarum
         quadrupedumque magis ritu plerumque putantur
          concipere uxores
           quia sic loca sumere possunt
           pectoribus positis sublatis semina lumbis
and the same authority condemns as hurtful those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex—

                 nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt
           clunibus ipsa viri venerem si lta retractet
           atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua
           ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque
          vomerem atque locis avertit seminis ictum
if it be justice to render to every one their due the beasts that serve love and defend their benefactors and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them do in this represent a certain air of our justice as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young and as to friendship they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have king lysimachuss dog hyrcanus master being dead lay on his bed obstinately refusing either to eat or drink and the day that his body was burnt he took a run and leaped into the fire where he was consumed as also did the dog of one pyrrhus for he would not stir from off his masters bed from the time he died and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his masters body there are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us without the consultation of reason and by a fortuitous temerity which others call sympathy of which beasts are as capable as we we see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel when separated we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind and where they meet it run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour animals have choice as well as we in their amours and cull out their mistresses neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice

desires are either natural and necessary as to eat and drink or natural and not necessary as the coupling with females or neither natural nor necessary of which last sort are almost all the desires of men they are all superfluous and artificial for tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature how little she has left us to desire our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering the stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day the delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites—

                  neque ilia
            magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum

                 nature in her pursuit of love disclaims
           the pride of titles and the pomp of names
these irregular desires that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us are so many that they almost exclude all the natural just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants or usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own animals are much more regular than we and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches and as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds witness the elephant who was rival to aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herbwench in the city of alexandria who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor for going through the market where they sold fruit he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her he would as much as possible keep her always in his sight and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom to feel her breasts they tell also of a dragon in love with a girl and of a goose enamoured of a child of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless glaucia in the town of asopus and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women we see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations but experience often shows us the contrary—

                  nec habetur turpe juvenc
           ferre patrem tergo fit equo sua filia conjux
           quasque creavit init pecudes caper ipsaque cujus
            semine concepta est ex illo concipit ales

                the heifer thinks it not a shame to take
          her lusty sire upon her willing back
           the horse his daughter leaps goats scruple not
           t increase the herd by those they have begot
         and birds of all sorts do in common live
         and by the seed they have conceived conceive
and for subtle cunning can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher thaless mule who fording a river laden with salt and by accident stumbling there so that the sacks he carried were all wet perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter he never failed so oft as he came to any river to lie down with his load till his master discovering the knavery ordered that he should be laden with wood wherein finding himself mistaken he ceased to practise that device there are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can and hide it with that exceeding great care though they never make any use of it at all as to thrift they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up and saving for the time to come but they have moreover a great deal of the science necessary thereto the ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty lest they should decay and rot but the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry but grows soft thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk whilst hasting to germination for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout

as to what concerns war which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions i would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or on contrary for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection as in truth the science of undoing and killing one another and of ruining and destroying our own kind has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not

                  quando leoni fortior eripuit vitam leo quo nemore unquam
           expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri

                 no lion drinks a weaker lions gore
            no boar expires beneath a stronger boar
yet are they not universally exempt witness the furious encounters of bees and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies—

            spe duobus regibus incessit magno discordia motu
           continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello
           gorda licet long prsciscere

                 but if contending factions arm the hive
           when rival kings in doubtful battle strive
           tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare
           and palpitating hearts that beat to war
i never read this divine description but that methinks i there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours for these warlike movements that so ravish us with their astounding noise and horror this rattle of guns drums and cries

               fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit totaque circum
           re renidescit tellus subterque virm vi
            excitur pedibus sonitus clamoreque montes
            icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi

                 when burnishd arms to heaven dart their rays
            and many a steely beam i th sunlight plays
           when trampled is the earth by horse and man
          until the very centre groans again
           and that the rocks struck by the various cries
          reverberate the sound unto the skies
in the dreadful embattling of so many thousands of armed men and so great fury ardour and courage tis pleasant to consider by what idle occasions they are excited and by how light ones appeased—

                 paridis propter narratur amorem
           greci barbari diro collisa duello

                of wanton paris the illicit love
            did greece and troy to ten years warfare move
all asia was ruined and destroyed for the lust of paris the envy of one single man a despite a pleasure a domestic jealousy causes that ought not to set two oysterwenches by the ears is the mover of all this mighty bustle shall we believe those very men who are themselves the principal authors of these mischiefs let us then hear the greatest the most powerful the most victorious emperor that ever was turning into a jest very pleasantly and ingeniously several battles fought both by sea and land the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men that followed his fortune and the strength and riches of two parts of the world drained for the expense of his expeditions—

                 quod futuit glaphyran antonius hanc mihi poenam

           fulviam ego ut futuam quid si me manius oret

           cause anthony is fired with glaphires charms
          fain would his fulvia tempt me to her arms
          if anthony be false what then must i
           be slave to fulvias lustful tyranny
            then would a thousand wanton waspish wives
i use my latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow me now this great body with so many fronts and so many motions which seems to threaten heaven and earth—

                quam multi lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus
           svus ubi orion hibemis conditur undis
            vel quam solo novo dens torrentur arist
            aut hermi campo aut lyci flaventibus arvis
           scuta sonant pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus

                   not thicker billows beat the lybian main
            when pale orion sits in wintry rain
           nor thicker harvests on rich hermus rise
          or lycian fields when phobus burns the skies
           than stand these troops their bucklers ring around
           their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground
this furious monster with so many heads and arms is yet man—feeble calamitous and miserable man tis but an anthill disturbed and provoked—

         it nigrum campis agmen

         the black troop marches to the field
a contrary blast the croaking of a flight of ravens the stumble of a horse the casual passage of an eagle a dream a voice a sign a morning mist are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn him dart but a sunbeam in his face he is melted and vanished blow but a little dust in his eyes as our poet says of the bees and all our ensigns and legions with the great pompey himself at the head of them are routed and crushed to pieces for it was he as i take it that sertorious beat in spain with those fine arms which also served eumenes against antigonus and surena against crassus—

                 swarm to my bed like bees into their hives
          declare for love or war she said and frownd
          no love ill grant to arms bid trumpets sound
                 hi motus animorum atque hoc certamina tanta
          pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent

                yet at thy will these dreadful conflicts cease
            throw but a little dust and all is peace
let us but slip our flies after them and they will have the force and courage to defeat them of fresh memory the portuguese having besieged the city of tamly in the territory of xiatine the inhabitants of the place brought a great many hives of which are great plenty in that place upon the wall and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings and so the citizens by this new sort of relief gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one the souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes but we are deceived for they are pushed on and pulled back in their motions by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings the same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes the same reason that makes us whip a lackey falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province they are as lightly moved as we but they are able to do more in a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same

as to fidelity there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters king pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead mans body and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office commanded that the body should be buried and took the dog along with him one day as he was at a general muster of his army this dog seeing his masters murderers with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder which was soon after perfected by form of justice as much was done by the dog of the wise hesiod who convicted the sons of ganictor of naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master another dog being to guard a temple at athens having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels fell to barking at him with all his force but the warders not awaking at the noise he followed him and day being broke kept off at a little distance without losing sight of him if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met and took whatever they gave him and if the thief laid down to sleep he likewise stayed upon the same place the news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit inquiring of the colour of the dog and at last found him in the city of cromyon and the thief also whom they brought back to athens where he got his reward and the judges in consideration of this good office ordered a certain measure of corn for the dogs daily sustenance at the public charge and the priests to take care of it plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth and that it happened in the age wherein he lived

as to gratitude for i think we need bring this word into a little repute this one example which apion reports himself to have been an eyewitness of shall suffice

one day says he at rome they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts and principally of lions of an unusual size there was one amongst the rest who by his furious deportment by the strength and largeness of his limbs and by his loud and dreadful roaring attracted the eyes of all the spectators amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one androdus of dacia belonging to a roman lord of consular dignity this lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop as it were in a wondering posture and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him this being done and being now assured of what he sought for he began to wag his tail as dogs do when they flatter their masters and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch who was beside himself and almost dead with fear androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them at which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy the emperor caused the slave to be called to know from him the cause of so strange an event who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story my master said he being proconsul in africa i was constrained by his severity and cruel usage being daily beaten to steal from him and run away and to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province i thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes sands and uninhabitable parts of that country resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me to make some shift or other to kill myself the sun being excessively hot at noon and the heat intolerable i lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave and went into it soon after there came in to me this lion with one foot wounded and bloody complaining and groaning with the pain he endured at his coming i was exceeding afraid but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den came gently to me holding out and showing me his wounded foot as if he demanded my assistance in his distress i then drew out a great splinter he had got there and growing a little more familiar with him squeezing the wound thrust out the matter dirt and gravel which was got into it and wiped and cleansed it the best i could he finding himself something better and much eased of his pain laid him down to rest and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand from that time forward he and i lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces which i roasted in the sun for want of fire and so ate it at last growing weary of this wild and brutish life the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision i departed thence and the third day after was taken by the soldiers who brought me from africa to this city to my master who presently condemned me to die and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts now by what i see this lion was also taken soon after who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands this is the story that androdus told the emperor which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people wherefore at the general request he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty and the lion was by order of the people presented to him we afterwards saw says apion androdus leading this lion in nothing but a small leash from tavern to tavern at rome and receiving what money every body would give him the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him every one that met him saying there goes the lion that entertained the man there goes the man that cured the lion

we often lament the loss of beasts we love and so do they the loss of us—

                 post bellator equus positis insignibus thon
          it lacrymans guttisque humectt grandibus ora

                 to close the pomp thon the steed of state
            is led the funral of his lord to wait
          stripped of his trappings with a sullen pace
          he walks and the big tears run rolling down his face
as some nations have their wives in common and some others have every one his own is not the same seen among beasts and marriages better kept than ours as to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves to league together and to give one another mutual assistance is it not known that oxen hogs and other animals at the cry of any of their kind that we offend all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence the fish scarus when he has swallowed the anglers hook his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces and if by chance one be got into the bow net the others present him their tails on the outside which he holding fast with his teeth they after that manner disengage and draw him out

mullets when one of their companions is engaged cross the line over their back and with a fin they have there indented like a saw cut and saw it asunder as to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life there are several like examples amongst them tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the seagudgeon for this reason called the guidefish whom the whale follows suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship in recompense of which service also whereas all the other things whether beast or vessel that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monsters mouth are immediately lost and swallowed up this little fish retires into it in great security and there sleeps during which time the whale never stirs but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide he goes wandering here and there and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm which plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of anticyra there is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile the wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal and if the ichneumon his mortal enemy approach to fight him this little bird for fear lest he should surprise him asleep both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger
he feeds of this monsters leavings who receives him familiarly into his mouth suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain and when he has a mind to shut his mouth he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little and without bruising or doing it any harm at all the shellfish called the naker lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp a little sort of animal of the lobster kind which serves him in the nature of a porter sitting at the opening of the shell which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish proper for their prey within the hollow of the shell where she enters too and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort in the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics as to astrology they teach it men for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice and never stir thence till the next equinox for which reason aristotle himself attributes to them this science as to geometry and arithmetic they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube every way square and make up the body of a battalion solid close and environed round with six equal sides and swim in this square order as large behind as before so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth and the breadth to the length

as to magnanimity it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to alexander the great from the indies they first brought him a stag to encounter next a boar and after that a bear all which he slighted and disdained to stir from his place but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults tis reported of an elephant that having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat but starved himself to death and as to clemency tis said of a tiger the most cruel of all beasts that a kid having been put in to him he suffered a two days hunger rather than hurt it and the third broke the grate he was shut up in to seek elsewhere for prey so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid his familiar and his guest and as to the laws of familiarity and agreement formed by conversation it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats dogs and hares tame together

but that which seamen by experience know and particularly in the sicilian sea of the quality of the halcyons surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth the poets indeed say that one only island delos which was before a floating island was fixed for the service of latonas lyingin but god has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed made stable and smooth without waves without winds or rain whilst the halcyon produces her young which is just about the solstice the shortest day of the year so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger their females never have to do with any other male but their own whom they serve and assist all their lives without ever forsaking him if he becomes weak and broken with age they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place and serve him till death but the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones nor guess at the materials plutarch who has seen and handled many of them thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together interlacing them some lengthwise and others across and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch which being done and the building finished she carries it to the beach where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky that open at the beating of the waves and on the contrary what is well built and has had the due finishing the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado and that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it for to any thing else it is so impenetrable close and shut nothing can enter not so much as the water of the sea this is a very dear description of this building and borrowed from a very good hand and yet methinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon and disdainfully to interpret effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend

to pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon of things she conceives to her own law of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities and making them to lay aside length breadth depth weight colour smell roughness smoothness hardness softness and all sensible accidents as mean and superfluous vestments to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition as rome and paris for example that i have in my fancy paris that i imagine i imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place without stone without plaster and without wood this very same privilege i say seems evidently to be in beasts for a courser accustomed to trumpets to musketshots and battles whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter as if he were in a fight it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise and an army without arms and without body—

                 quippe videbis equos fortes cum membra jacebunt
          in somnis sudare tamen spirareque spe
            et quasi de palm summas contendere vires

                  you shall see manegd horses in their sleep
            sweat snort start tremble and a clutter keep
           as if with all their force they striving were
            the victors palm proudly away to bear
the hare that a greyhound imagines in his sleep after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps stretch out his tail shake his legs and perfectly represents all the motions of a course is a hare without fur and without bones—

           venantumque canes in molli spe quiete
          jactant crura tamen subito vocesque repente
         mittunt et crebras reducunt naribus auras
           ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum
          expergeftique sequuntur inania spe
          cervorum simulacra fag quasi dedita cernant
           donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se

               and hounds stir often in their quiet rest
         spending their mouths as if upon a quest
         snuff and breathe quick and short as if they went
          in a full chase upon a burning scent
         nay being wakd imagind stags pursue
         as if they had them in their real view
         till having shook themselves more broad awake
         they do at last discover the mistake
the watchdogs that we often observe to snarl in their dreams and afterwards bark out and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible without dimension without colour and without being—

                consueta domi catulorum blanda propago
            degere spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem
           discutere et corpus de terra corripere instant
           proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur

                 the fawning whelps of household curs will rise
          and shaking the soft slumber from their eyes
          oft bark and stare at evry one within
          as upon faces they had never seen
to the beauty of the body before i proceed any further i should know whether or no we are agreed about the description tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms of which were there any natural rule and prescription we should know it in common as the heat of the fire but we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking—

         turpis romano belgicus ore color

         a german hue ill suits a roman face
the indians paint it black and tawny with great swelled lips wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold to make it hang down to the mouth as also the under lip with great hoops enriched with precious stones that weigh them down to fall upon the chin it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth even below the roots in peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful which they stretch out as far as they can by art and a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels that he did with great ease put his arm sleeve and all through the hole of an ear there are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth and hate to see them white whilst others paint them red the women are reputed more beautiful not only in biscay but elsewhere for having their heads shaved and which is more in certain frozen countries as pliny reports the mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty and though they shave all other parts they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders we should paint deformity so the italians fashion it gross and massy the spaniards gaunt and slender and amongst us one has it white another brown one soft and delicate another strong and vigorous one will have his mistress soft and gentle others haughty and majestic just as the preference in beauty that plato attributes to the spherical figure the epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl but be it how it will nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest and if we will judge ourselves aright we shall find that if there be some animals less favoured in this than we there are others and in greater number that are more a multis animalibus decore vincimur many animals surpass us in beauty even among the terrestrial our compatriots for as to those of sea setting the figure aside which cannot fall into any manner of proportion being so much another thing in colour clearness smoothness and arrangement we sufficiently give place to them and no less in all qualities to the aerial and this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter of our erect stature looking towards heaven our original

                  pronaque cum spectent animalia ctera terrain
          os homini sublime ddit columque tueri
          jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus

                whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend
          their sight and to their earthly mother tend
          he set mans face aloft that with his eyes
          uplifted he might view the starry skies
is truly poetical for there are several little beasts who have their sight absolutely turned towards heaven and i find the gesture of camels and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours what animals have not their faces above and not before and do not look opposite as we do and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man and what qualities of our bodily constitution in plato and cicero may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd for those as to outward appearance and form of visage are baboons—

          simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis

          how like to man in visage and in shape
         is of all beasts the most uncouth the ape
as to the internal and vital parts the hog in earnest when i consider man stark naked even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty his defects natural subjection and imperfections i find that we have more reason than any other animal to cover ourselves and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us to trick ourselves out with their beauties and hide ourselves under their spoils their wool feathers hair and silk let us observe as to the rest that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind and really tis also an effect worth consideration that they who are masters in the trade prescribe as a remedy for amorous passions the full and free view of the body a man desires for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves—

                 ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes
            viderat in cursu qui fuit hsit amor

             the love thats tilting when those parts appear
         open to view flags in the hot career
and although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another it is not modesty so much as cunning and prudence that makes our ladies so circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are painted and tricked up for the public view—

              nec veneres nostras hoc fallit quo magis ips
          omnia summopere hos vit postscenia celant
         quos retinere volunt adstrictoque esse in amore

              of this our ladies are full well aware
         which make them with such privacy and care
         behind the scene all those defects remove
         likely to check the flame of those they love
whereas in several animals there is nothing that we do not love and that does not please our senses so that from their very excrements we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces but also our richest ornaments and perfumes this discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine supernatural and extraordinary beauties which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil

as to the rest the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature by our own confession is very much to their advantage we attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good future and absent good for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible or good that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion as reason knowledge and honour and leave to them for their dividend essential durable and palpable good as peace repose security innocence and health health i say the fairest and richest present that nature can make us insomuch that philosophy even the stoic is so bold as to say that heraclitus and pherecides could they have trucked their wisdom for health and have delivered themselves the one of his dropsy and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him they had done well by which they set a greater value upon wisdom comparing and putting it into the balance with health than they do with this other proposition which is also theirs they say that if circe had presented ulysses with the two potions the one to make a fool become a wise man and the other to make a wise man become a fool that ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last than consent to that by which circe changed his human figure into that of a beast and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner forsake me let me alone rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass how the philosophers then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering it is then no more by reason by discourse and by the soul that we excel beasts tis by our beauty our fair complexion and our fine symmetry of parts for which we must quit our intelligence our prudence and all the rest well i accept this open and free confession certainly they knew that those parts upon which we so much value ourselves are no other than vain fancy if beasts then had all the virtue knowledge wisdom and stoical perfection they would still be beasts and would not be comparable to man miserable wicked mad man for in short whatever is not as we are is nothing worth and god to procure himself an esteem among us must put himself into that shape as we shall show anon by which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason but by a foolish pride and vain opinion that we prefer ourselves before other animals and separate ourselves from their society and condition

but to return to what i was upon before we have for our part inconstancy irresolution incertitude sorrow superstition solicitude of things to come even after we shall be no more ambition avarice jealousy envy irregular frantic and untamed appetites war lying disloyalty detraction and curiosity doubtless we have strangely overpaid this fine reason upon which we so much glorify ourselves and this capacity of judging and knowing if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject unless we shall also think fit as even socrates does to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts that whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of venus she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons ut vinum ogrotis quia prodest rar nocet sopissime melius est non adhibere omnino quam spe dubio salutis in apertam perniciem incurrere sic haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis acumen solertiam quam rationem vocamus quoniam pestifera sint multis admodum paucis saluiaria non dari omnino quam tam muniice et tam large dari as it falls out that wine often hurting the sick and very rarely doing them good it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit so i know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion this penetration this subtlety that we call reason had not been given to man at all considering how pestiferous it is to many and useful but to few than to have been conferred in so abundant manner and with so liberal a hand of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to yarro and aristotle did it exempt them from human inconveniences were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter
did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout or for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints did they feel it the less did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach or with cuckoldry by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common on the contrary having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge the one amongst the romans and the other amongst the greeks and in a time when learning did most flourish we have not heard nevertheless that they had any particular excellence in their lives nay the greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his have we observed that pleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands astrology and grammar than with others

i have known in my time a hundred artisans a hundred labourers wiser and more happy than the rectors of the university and whom i had much rather have resembled learning methinks has its place amongst the necessary things of life as glory nobility dignity or at the most as beauty riches and such other qualities which indeed are useful to it but remotely and more by opinion than by nature we stand very little more in need of offices rules and laws of living in our society than cranes and ants do in theirs and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition if man was wise he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned aye in all sorts of virtue old rome seems to me to have been of much greater value both for peace and war than that learned rome that ruined itself and though all the rest should be equal yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity but i will leave this discourse that would lead me farther than i am willing to follow and shall only say this further tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man we are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every mans own judgment we are to prescribe it to him and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion otherwise according to the imbecility and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions we should at large forge ourselves duties that would as epicurus says enjoin us to eat one another

the first law that ever god gave to man was a law of pure obedience it was a commandment naked and simple wherein man had nothing to inquire after nor to dispute forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor from obedience and submission spring all other virtues as all sin does from selfopinion and on the contrary the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and the sirens in homer to allure ulysses and draw him within the danger of their snares offered to give him knowledge the plague of man is the opinion of wisdom and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us by our religion as proper to faith and obedience cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones secundum elementa mundi take heed lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men and the rudiments of the world there is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body but where shall we find it

it seems in truth that nature for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state has only given us presumption for our inheritance tis as epictetus says that man has nothing properly his own but the use of his opinion we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion the gods have health in essence says philosophy and sickness in intelligence man on the contrary possesses his goods by fancy his ills in essence we have reason to magnify the power of our imagination for all our goods are only in dream hear this poor calamitous animal huff there is nothing says cicero so charming as the employment of letters of letters i say by means whereof the infinity of things the immense grandeur of nature the heavens even in this world the earth and the seas are discovered to us tis they that have taught us religion moderation and the grandeur of courage and that have rescued our souls from darkness to make her see all things high low first last and middling tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure and without offence does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the everliving and almighty god but as to effects a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal more sweet and constant than his

               that god great memmus was a god no doubt
         who prince of life first found that reason out
         now wisdom called and by his art who did
         that life in tempests tost and darkness hid

here are brave ranting words but a very slight accident put this mans understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd notwithstanding this instructing god this divine wisdom of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of democrituss book i am going to speak of all things and that foolish title that aristotle prefixes to one of his order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book and at last made him kill himself—eusebiuss chronicon

of the mortal gods and the judgment of chrysippus that dion was as virtuous as god and my seneca himself says that god had given him life but that to live well was his own conformably to this other in virtute vere gloriamur quod non contingeret si id donum deo non nobis haberemus we truly glory in our virtue which would not be if it was given us of god and not by ourselves this is also senecas saying that the wise man hath fortitude equal with god but that his is in spite of human frailty wherein therefore he more than equals god there is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity there is none of us who take so much offence to see himself equalled with god as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our creator

but we must trample under foot this foolish vanity and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded so long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself he will never acknowledge what he owes to his maker his eggs shall always be chickens as the saying is we must therefore strip him to his shirt let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour by crying out against it thou mayst do thy worst i will not confess that thou art an evil he was as sensible of the pain as my footman but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue at least and restraining it within the laws of his sect re succumbere non oportebat verbis gloriantem it did not become him that spoke so big to confess his frailty when he came to the test arcesilas being ill of the gout and carneades who had come to see him going away troubled at his condition he called him back and showing him his feet and breast there is nothing comes thence hither said he this has something a better grace for he feels himself in pain and would be disengaged from it but his heart notwithstanding is not conquered nor subdued by it the other stands more obstinately to his point but i fear rather verbally than really and dionysius heracleotes afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions but even though knowledge should in effect do as they say and could blunt the point and dull the edge of the misfortunes that attend us what does she more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently—the philosopher pyrrho being at sea in very great danger by reason of a mighty storm presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him in that extremity but a hog they had on board that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest philosophy when she has said all she can refers us at last to the example of a gladiator wrestler or muleteer in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death sense of pain and other inconveniences and more of endurance than ever knowledge furnished any one withal that was not bom and bred to hardship what is the cause that we make incisions and cut the tender limbs of an infant and those of a horse more easily than our own—but ignorance only how many has mere force of imagination made sick we often see men cause themselves to be let blood purged and physicked to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion—when real infirmities fail us knowledge lends us hers that colour that complexion portend some catarrhous defluxion this hot season threatens us with a fever this breach in the lifeline of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition and at last she roundly attacks health itself saying this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture there must be blood taken and the heat abated lest it turn against yourself compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite measuring things only by the present sense without knowledge and without prognostic that feels no pain or sickness but when he is really ill whereas the other has the stone in his soul before he has it in his bladder as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come he must anticipate it by fancy and run to meet it

what i say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment my ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others and of events i see elsewhere upon the like occasion i find of all sorts and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me i receive health with open arms free full and entire and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare so far am i from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us that which is told us of those of brazil that they never die but of old age is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in but i rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls free from all passion thought or employment extended or unpleasing a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance without letters without law without king or any manner of religion and whence comes that which we find by experience that the heaviest and dullest men are most able and the most to be desired in amorous performances and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability dissolves and tires it as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself what puts the soul beside itself and more usually throws it into madness but her own promptness vigour and agility and finally her own proper force of what is the most subtle folly made but of the most subtle wisdom as great friendships spring from great enmities and vigorous health from mortal diseases so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other in the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline and the most excellent and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability into what a condition through his own agitation and promptness of fancy is one of the most judicious ingenious and nearest formed of any other italian poet to the air of the ancient and true poesy lately fallen has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him to this light that has blinded him to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own to this curious and laborious search after sciences that has reduced him to imbecility and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul that has rendered him without exercise and without soul i was more angry if possible than compassionate to see him at ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself forgetting both himself and his works which without his knowledge though before his face have been published unformed and incorrect

would you have a man healthy would you have him regular and in a steady and secure posture muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth we must be made beasts to be made wise and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led and if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils brings this disadvantage along with it to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure this is true but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt we are not so sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness

                pungit
           in cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus
          quando valere nihil quemquam movet hoc juvat unum
         quod me non torquet latus aut pes
         ctera quisquam vix queat aut sanum sese aut sentire valentem

              the body with a little sting is grievd
         when the most perfect health is not perceivd
         this only pleases me that spleen nor gout
         neither offend my side nor wring my foot
         excepting these scarce any one can tell
         or eer observes when hes in health and well
our wellbeing is nothing but the not being ill which is the reason why that sect of philosophers which sets the greatest value upon pleasure has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain to be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire as ennius says—

           nimium boni est cui nihil est mali
for that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness that active moving and i know not how itching and biting pleasure even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark the appetite that carries us headlong to womens embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest and delivered from the fever and so of the rest i say then that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition and yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense for crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of epicurus if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived i do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired i am very well content not to be sick but if i am i would know that i am so and if a caustic be applied or incisions made in any part i would feel them in truth whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure and finally annihilate man himself istud nihil dolere non sine magn mercede contingit immanitatis in animo stuporis in corpore an insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul and of stupidity of the body evil appertains to man of course neither is pain always to be avoided nor pleasure always pursued

tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil she is constrained to come to this composition to give us the reins and permit us to fly into the lap of the other and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune for what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates ponit he directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts and recalling agreeable ideas if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn for not only to a philosopher but to any man in his right wits when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking greek wine a month ago it would rather only make matters worse to him—

          che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia

           the thinking of pleasure doubles trouble
of the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives only to remember the happiness that is past and to forget the misadventures we have undergone as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power and counsel wherein we are yet no more to seek

           suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria

           sweet is the memory of bygone pain
how does philosophy that should arm me to contend with fortune and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts for the memory represents to us not what we choose but what she pleases nay there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it and tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it and this is false est situm in nobis ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus it is in our power to bury as it were in a perpetual oblivion all adverse accidents and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes and this is true memini etiam quo nolo oblivisci non possum quo volo i do also remember what i would not but i cannot forget what i would and whose counsel is this his qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus who alone durst profess himself a wise man

                qui genus humanum ingenio superavit et omnes
          prstinxit stellas exortus uti thereus sol

                who from mankind the prize of knowledge won
         and put the stars out like the rising sun
to empty and disfurnish the memory is not this the true way to ignorance

         iners malorum remedium ignorantia est

         ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils
we find several other like precepts whereby we are permitted to borrow frivolous appearances from the vulgar where we find the strongest reason will not answer the purpose provided they administer satisfaction and comfort where they cannot cure the wound they are content to palliate and benumb it i believe they will not deny this that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment they would accept it—

                potare et spargere flores
          incipiam patiarque vel inconsultus haberi

               give me to drink and crownd with flowers despise
          the grave disgrace of being thought unwise
there would be a great many philosophers of lycass mind this man being otherwise of very regular manners living quietly and contentedly in his family and not failing in any office of his duty either towards his own or strangers and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful things became nevertheless by some distemper in his brain possessed with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre a spectator of the finest sights and the best comedies in the world and being cured by the physicians of his frenzy was hardly prevented from endeavouring by suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination—

                pol i me occidistis amici
           non servastis ait cui sic extorta voluptas
           et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error

                by heaven youve killed me friends outright
          and not preserved me since my dear delight
         and pleasing error by my better sense
          unhappily returnd is banished hence
with a madness like that of thrasylaus the son of pythodorus who made himself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of pirus and that came into the haven only made their voyages for his profit congratulating them upon their successful navigation and receiving them with the greatest joy and when his brother crito caused him to be restored to his better understanding he infinitely regretted that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind tis according to the old greek verse that there is a great deal of convenience in not being overwise

and ecclesiastes in much wisdom there is much sorrow and who gets wisdom gets labour and trouble

even that to which philosophy consents in general that last remedy which she applies to all sorts of necessities to put an end to the life we are not able to endure placet—pare non placet—qucumque vis exi pungit dolor—vel fodiat sane si nudus es da jugulum sin tectus armis vulcaniis id est fortitudine rsist does it please—obey it not please—go where thou wilt does grief prick thee—nay stab thee—if thou art naked present thy throat if covered with the arms of vulcan that is fortitude resist it and this word so used in the greek festivals aut bibat aut abeat either drink or go which sounds better upon the tongue of a gascon who naturally changes the h into v than on that of cicero—

               vivere si recte nescis decede peritis
         lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti
         tempus abire tibi est ne potum largius quo
           rideat et pulset lasciva decentius tas

               if to live well and right thou dost not know
         give way and leave thy place to those that do
          thoust eaten drunk and playd to thy content
          tis time to make thy parting compliment
          lest youth more decent in their follies scoff
         the nauseous scene and hiss thee reeling off
what is it other than a confession of his impotency and a sending back not only to ignorance to be there in safety but even to stupidity insensibility and nonentity

               democritum postquam matura vetustas
          admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis
          sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse

              soon as through age democritus did find
           a manifest decadence in his mind
           he thought he now survivd to his own wrong
         and went to meet his death that stayd too long
tis what antisthenes said that a man should either make provision of sense to understand or of a halter to hang himself and what chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet tyrtus—

         or to arrive at virtue or at death
and crates said that love would be cured by hunger if not by time and whoever disliked these two remedies by a rope that sextius of whom both seneca and plutarch speak with so high an encomium having applied himself all other things set aside to the study of philosophy resolved to throw himself into the sea seeing the progress of his studies too tedious and slow he ran to find death since he could not overtake knowledge these are the words of the law upon the subject if peradventure some great inconvenience happen for which there is no remedy the haven is near and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff for tis the fear of dying and not the love of life that ties the fool to his body

as life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant so more innocent and better also it renders it as i was saying before the simple and ignorant says st paul raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it and we with all our knowledge plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss i am neither swayed by valentinian a professed enemy to all learning and letters nor by licinius both roman emperors who called them the poison and pest of all political government nor by mahomet who as tis said interdicted all manner of learning to his followers but the example of the great lycurgus and his authority with the reverence of the divine lacedemonian policy so great so admirable and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness without any institution or practice of letters ought certainly to be of very great weight such as return from the new world discovered by the spaniards in our fathers days testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live without magistrate and without law than ours do where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business—

                   di cittatorie piene e di libelli
           desamine e di carte di procure
           hanno le mani e il seno e gran fastelli
          di chioge di consigli et di letture
          per cui le faculta de poverelli
           non sono mai nelle citt sicure
            hanno dietro e dinanzi e dambi i lati
            notai procuratori ed avvocati

                    their bags were full of writs and of citations
            of process and of actions and arrests
            of bills of answers and of replications
            in courts of delegates and of requests
            to grieve the simple sort with great vexations
            they had resorting to them as their guests

it was what a roman senator of the latter ages said that their predecessors breath stunk of garlic but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience and that on the contrary those of his time were all sweet odour without but stunk within of all sorts of vices that is to say as i interpret it that they abounded with learning and eloquence but were very defective in moral honesty incivility ignorance simplicity roughness are the natural companions of innocence curiosity subtlety knowledge bring malice in their train humility fear obedience and affability which are the principal things that support and maintain human society require an empty and docile soul and little presuming upon itself

christians have a particular knowledge how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man the thirst of knowledge and the desire to become more wise was the first ruin of man and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation pride was his ruin and corruption tis pride that diverts him from the common path and makes him embrace novelties and rather choose to be head of a troop lost and wandering in the path of error to be a master and a teacher of lies than to be a disciple in the school of truth suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another in the right and beaten road tis peradventure the meaning of this old greek saying that superstition follows pride and obeys it as if it were a father —greek— ah presumption how much dost thou hinder us

after that socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage he was astonished at it and searching and examining himself throughout could find no foundation for this divine judgment he knew others as just temperate valiant and learned as himself and more eloquent more handsome and more profitable to their country than he at last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others nor wise but only because he did not think himself so and that his god considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance and simplicity his best wisdom the sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves dust and ashes says it to such what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself and in another place god has made man like unto a shadow of whom who can judge when by removing the light it shall be vanished man is a thing of nothing

our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height that of the works of our creator those best bear his mark and are with better title his which we the least understand to meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to christians to believe and it is so much the more according to reason by how much it is against human reason if it were according to reason it would be no more a miracle and if it were according to example it would be no longer a singular thing melius scitur deus nesdendo god is better known by not knowing him says st austin and tacitus sanctius est ac reverentius de actis deorum credere quam scire it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of god than to know them and plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into god the world and the first causes of things atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire difficile et quum jam inveneris indicare in vulgtis nefas to find out the parent of the world is very difficult and when found out to reveal him to the vulgar is sin says cicero we talk indeed of power truth justice which are words that signify some great thing but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all we say that god fears that god is angry that god loves

           immortalia mortali sermone notantes

          giving to things immortal mortal names
these are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in god according to our form nor can we imagine them according to his it only belongs to god to know himself and to interpret his own works and he does it in our language going out of himself to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth how can prudence which is the choice between good and evil be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch how can reason and intelligence which we make use of to arrive by obscure at apparent things seeing that nothing is obscure to him how justice which distributes to every one what appertains to him a thing begot by the society and community of men how is that in god how temperance which is the moderation of corporal pleasures that have no place in the divinity fortitude to support pain labour and dangers as little appertains to him as the rest these three things have no access to him for which reason aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice neque gratia neque ira teneri potest quod quo talia essent imbecilla essent omnia he can neither be affected with favour nor indignation because both these are the effects of frailty

the participation we have in the knowledge of truth such as it is is not acquired by our own force god has sufficiently given us to understand that by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people simple and ignorant men that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets our faith is not of our own acquiring tis purely the gift of anothers bounty tis not by meditation or by virtue of our own understanding that we have acquired our religion but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it and our blindness more than our clearness of sight tis more by the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge let us bring nothing of our own but obedience and subjection for as it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe

finally should i examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest wherein he has busied himself so many ages has enriched him with any new force or any solid truth i believe he will confess if he speaks from his conscience that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness we have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before the same has fallen out to men truly wise which befalls the ears of corn they shoot and raise their heads high and pert whilst empty but when full and swelled with grain in maturity begin to flag and droop so men having tried and sounded all things and having found in that mass of knowledge and provision of so many various things nothing solid and firm and nothing but vanity have quitted their presumption and acknowledged their natural condition tis what velleius reproaches cotta withal and cicero that they had learned of philo that they had learned nothing pherecydes one of the seven sages writing to thales upon his deathbed i have said he given order to my people after my interment to carry my writings to thee if they please thee and the other sages publish if not suppress them they contain no certainty with which i myself am satisfied neither do i pretend to know the truth or to attain to it i rather open than discover things the wisest man that ever was being asked what he knew made answer he knew this that he knew nothing by which he verified what has been said that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not that is to say that even what we think we know is but a piece and a very little one of our ignorance we know things in dreams says plato and are ignorant of them in truth ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci nihil percipi nihil sciri posse dixerunt angustos sensus imbecilles animos brevia curricula vito almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known nothing to be perceived or understood the senses are too limited mens minds too weak and the course of life too short and of cicero himself who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth valerius says that he began to disrelish letters in his old age and when at his studies it was with great independency upon any one party following what he thought probable now in one sect and then in another evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy dicendum est sed ita ut nihil affirment quceram omnia dubitans plerumque et mihi diffidens something i must say but so as to affirm nothing i inquire into all things but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself

i should have too fair a game should i consider man in his common way of living and in gross yet i might do it by his own rule who judges truth not by weight but by the number of votes let us set the people aside

              qui vigilans stertit
           mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti

                half of his life by lazy sleeps possessd
          and when awake his soul but nods at best
who neither feel nor judge and let most of their natural faculties lie idle i will take man in his highest ground let us consider him in that little number of men excellent and culled out from the rest who having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force have moreover hardened and whetted it by care study and art and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive they have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage both within and without the world tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain they have regulated the world with policies and laws they have instructed it with arts and sciences and by the example of their admirable manners i shall make account of none but such men as these their testimony and experience let us examine how far they have proceeded and where they stopped the errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own

whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this either to say that he has found it or that it is not to be found or that he is yet upon the search all philosophy is divided into these three kinds her design is to seek out truth knowledge and certainty the peripatetics epicureans stoics and others have thought they have found it these established the sciences we have and have treated of them as of certain knowledge clitomachus carneades and the academics have despaired in their search and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings the result of these is weakness and human ignorance this sect has had the most and the most noble followers pyrrho and other skeptics or epechists whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from homer the seven sages and from archilochus and euripides and to whose number these are added zeno democritus and xenophanes say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth these conclude that the others who think they have found it out are infinitely deceived and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it for this establishing a standard of our power to know and judge the difficulty of things is a great and extreme knowledge of which they doubt whether man is capable—

          so knows not that
the ignorance that knows itself judges and condemns itself is not an absolute ignorance to be such it must be ignorant of itself so that the profession of the pyrrhonians is to waver doubt and inquire not to make themselves sure of or responsible to themselves for any thing of the three actions of the soul imaginative appetitive and consentive they receive the two first the last they kept ambiguous without inclination or approbation either of one thing or another so light as it is zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus an open and expanded hand signified appearance a hand half shut and the fingers a little bending consent a clenched fist comprehension when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer knowledge now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible receiving all objects without application or consent leads them to their ataraxy which is a peaceable condition of life temperate and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things whence spring fear avarice envy immoderate desires ambition pride superstition love of novelty rebellion disobedience obstinacy and the greatest part of bodily ills nay and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline for they debate after a very gentle manner they fear no requital in their disputes when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed and love tobe contradicted to engender doubt and suspense of judgment which is their end they only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief if you take their arguments they will as readily maintain the contrary tis all one to them they have no choice if you maintain that snow is black they will argue on the contrary that it is white if you say it is neither the one nor the other they will maintain that it is both if you hold of certain judgment that you know nothing they will maintain that you do yea and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt they will argue against you that you doubt not or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt and by this extremity of doubt which jostles itself they separate and divide themselves from many opinions even of those they have several ways maintained both concerning doubt and ignorance why shall not they be allowed to doubt say they as well as the dogmatists one of whom says green another yellow can any thing be proposed to us to grant or deny which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous and where others are carried away either by the custom of their country or by the instruction of parents or by accident as by a tempest without judgment and without choice nay and for the most part before the age of discretion to such and such an opinion to the sect whether stoic or epicurean with which they are prepossessed enslaved and fast bound as to a thing they cannot forsake ad quamcumque disciplinant velut tempestate delati ad earn tanquam ad saxum adhorescunt every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty and consider things without obligation or slavery hoc liberiores et solutiores quod integra illis est judicandi potestas in this more unconstrained and free because they have the greater power of judging is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle ones self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced is it not much better to suspend ones persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions what shall i choose what you please provided you will choose a very foolish answer but such a one nevertheless as all dogmatism seems to point at and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of

take the most eminent side that of the greatest reputation it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it is it not better to keep out of this hurlyburly you are permitted to embrace aristotles opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life and to give the lie to plato thereupon and shall they be interdicted to doubt him if it be lawful for pantius to maintain his opinion about augury dreams oracles vaticinations of which the stoics made no doubt at all why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters established by the common consent of the school whereof he is a professor and a member if it be a child that judges he knows not what it is if a wise man he is prepossessed they have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle having eased themselves of the care of defence if you strike them they care not provided they strike too and they turn every thing to their own use if they overcome your argument is lame if you theirs if they fall short they verify ignorance if you fall short you do it if they prove that nothing is known tis well if they cannot prove it tis also well ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur that when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended and they make account to find out with much greater facility why a thing is false than why tis true that which is not than that which is and what they do not believe than what they do their way of speaking is i assert nothing it is no more so than so or than neither one nor tother i understand it not appearances are everywhere equal the law of speaking pro or con is the same nothing seems true that may not seem false their sacramental word is that is to say i hold i stir not this is the burden of their song and others of like stuff the effect of which is a pure entire perfect and absolute suspension of judgment they make use of their reason to inquire and debate but not to fix and determine whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance a judgment without bias propension or inclination upon any occasion whatever conceives a true idea of pyrrhonism i express this fancy as well as i can by reason that many find it hard to conceive and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely

as to what concerns the actions of life they are in this of the common fashion they yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations to the power and impulse of passions to the constitution of laws and customs and to the tradition of arts non enim nos deus ista scire sed tantummodo uti voluit for god would not have us know but only use those things they suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things without any dispute or judgment for which reason i cannot consent to what is said of pyrrho by those who represent him heavy and immovable leading a kind of savage and unsociable life standing the jostle of carts going upon the edge of precipices and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws this is to enhance upon his discipline he would never make himself a stock or a stone he would show himself a living man discoursing reasoning enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason the fantastic imaginary and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it ordaining and establishing he has utterly quitted and renounced yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended perceived or consented to if he means to live and if he goes to sea he follows that design not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel the experience of the pilot and the convenience of the season and such probable circumstances after which he is bound to go and suffer himself to be governed by appearances provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them he has a body he has a soul the senses push them the mind spurs them on and although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent considering that there may be some false equal to these true appearances yet does he not for all that fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience how many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge that decide not on true and false and only follow that which seems so there are say they true and false and we have in us wherewith to seek it but not to make it stay when we touch it we are much more prudent in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world without inquiry a soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose men that judge and control their judges do never duly submit to them

how much more docile and easy to be governed both by the laws of religion and civil polity are simple and incurious minds than those overvigilant wits that will still be prating of divine and human causes there is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this this presents man naked and empty confessing his natural weakness fit to receive some foreign force from above unfurnished of human and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge making nought of his own judgment to give more room to faith neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances humble obedient disciplinable and studious a sworn enemy of heresy and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions introduced by false sects tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of god as he shall please to write upon it the more we resign and commit ourselves to god and the more we renounce ourselves of the greater value we are take in good part says ecclesiastes the things that present themselves to thee as they seem and taste from hand to mouth the rest is out of thy knowledge dominus novit cogitationes hominum quoniam van sunt the lord knoweth the hearts of men that they are but vanity

thus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy two make open profession of doubt and ignorance and in that of the dogmatists which is the third it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt which the learned rather feign than know timus being to instruct socrates in what he knew of the gods the world and men proposes to speak to him as a man to a man and that it is sufficient if his reasons are probable as those of another for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand which one of his followers has thus imitated ut potero explicabo nec tamen ut pythius apollo certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero sed ut homunculus probabilia conjectur sequens i will as well as i am able explain affirming yet not as the pythian oracle that what i say is fixed and certain but like a mere man that follows probabilities by conjecture and this upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death he has elsewhere translated from the very words of plato si forte de deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes minus id quod habemiis in animo consequimur haud erit mirum oquum est enim meminisse et me qui disseram hominem esse et vos qui judicetis ut si probabilia dicentur nihil ultra requiratis if perchance when we discourse of the nature of god and the worlds original we cannot do it as we desire it will be no great wonder for it is just you should remember that both i who speak and you who are to judge are men so that if probable things are delivered you shall require and expect no more aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other mens opinions and beliefs to compare them with his own and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others which made epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings this is the prince of all dogmatists and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt in earnest we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice it is in effect a pyrrhonism under a resolutive form hear ciceros protestation who expounds to us anothers fancy by his own qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est hoc in philosophi ratio contra omnia disserendi nuttamque rem aperte judicandi profecta a socrate repetita ab arcesila conjirmata a gameade usqu ad nostram viget cetatemhi sumus qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus tanta similitudine ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota they who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary this practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing and of absolutely concluding nothing begun by socrates repeated by arcesilaus and confirmed by cameades has continued in use even to our own times we are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true and they so resemble one another that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent why hath not aristotle only but most of the philosophers affected difficulty if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick clitomachus affirmed that he could never discover by carneadess writings what opinion he was of this was it that made epicurus affect to be abstruse and that procured heraclitus the epithet of —greek— difficulty is a coin the learned make use of like jugglers to conceal the vanity of their art and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay

                 claras ob obscuram linguam magis inter manes
         omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque

                bombast and riddle best do puppies please
         for fools admire and love such things as these
         and a dull quibble wrapt in dubious phrase
          up to the height doth their wise wonder raise
cicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology logic and geometry than they were really worth saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life and more profitable and proper studies the cyrenaick philosophers in like manner despised physics and logic zeno in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth declared all the liberal arts of no use chrysippus said that what plato and aristotle had writ concerning logic they had only done in sport and by way of exercise and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing plutarch says the same of metaphysics and epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric grammar poetry mathematics and natural philosophy excepted of all the sciences and socrates of them all excepting that which treats of manners and of life whatever any one required to be instructed in by him he would ever in the first place demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past which he examined and judged esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil profuerunt that learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage

as to the rest some have looked upon plato as a dogmatist others as a doubter others in some things the one and in other things the other socrates the conductor of his dialogues is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes never determining never satisfying and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself homer their author has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose tis said that ten several sects sprung from plato yet in my opinion never did any instruction halt and stumble if his does not

socrates said that midwives in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth left the trade of bringing forth themselves and that by the title of a wise man or sage which the gods had conferred upon him he was disabled in his virile and mental love of the faculty of bringing forth contenting himself to help and assist those that could to open their nature anoint the passes and facilitate their birth to judge of the infant baptize nourish fortify swath and circumcise it exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others

it is so with the most part of this third sort of authors as the ancients have observed in the writings of anaxagoras democritus parmenides xenophanes and others they have a way of writing doubtful in substance and design rather inquiring than teaching though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods is not the same thing seen in seneca and plutarch how many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them so many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues to the end that he might with greater decency from several mouths deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies it is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably and better that is to say more copiously and with greater profit let us take example from ourselves judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people the most exemplary of them and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion which with them is quotidian and common to every judge as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit and the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter which is the meaning of the maxim—in a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief for as euripides says—

         gods various works perplex the thoughts of men
like that which empedocles as if transported with a divine fury and compelled by truth often strewed here and there in his writings no no we feel nothing we see nothing all things are concealed from us there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is according to the divine saying cogitationes mortalium timid et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice for the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful and our devices are but uncertain it is not to be thought strange if men despairing to overtake what they hunt after have not however lost the pleasure of the chase study being of itself so pleasant an employment and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures the stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind will have it curbed and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge

democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness and to be satisfied in it was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered which his maid observing and having understood the cause smilingly told him that he need not trouble himself about that for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey he was vexed at this discovery and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon go thy way said he thou hast done me an injury but for all that i will seek out the cause as if it were natural and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect this story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things of the acquisition of which we despair plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking satius est supervacua discere quam nihil tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all as in all sorts of feeding the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone and that what we take which is acceptable to the palate is not always nourishing or wholesome so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful thus they say the consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds it raises and elevates us makes us disdain low and terrestrial things by comparing them with those that are celestial and high the mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it this is what they profess the vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand to comprehend the form greatness and beauty of it even though he should thereby be immediately burned he would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present or might afterwards have acquired

i cannot easily persuade myself that epicurus plato and pytagoras have given us their atom idea and numbers for current pay they were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain but in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance provided that though false they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur non ex scienti vi these things every one fancies according to his wit and not by any power of knowledge

one of the ancients who was reproached that he professed philosophy of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account made answer that this was truly to philosophize

they wished to consider all to balance every thing and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity some things they wrote for the benefit of public society as their religions and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country

plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule when he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions as fit to persuade the vulgar as impossible to be believed by himself knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions especially the most immoderate and preposterous and yet in his laws he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful he says very roundly in his republic that it is often necessary for the benefit of men to deceive them it is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth and the others utility by which the last have gained their reputation tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life the boldest sects as the epicurean pyrrhonian and the new academic are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account

there are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about some to the right and others to the left every one endeavouring right or wrong to give them some kind of colour for having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation or establishing any certain truth but merely for exercise non tam id sensisse quod dicerent quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse they seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter and if we did not take it thus how should we palliate so great inconstancy variety and vanity of opinions as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men as for example what can be more vain than to imagine to guess at god by our analogies and conjectures to direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws and to serve ourselves at the expense of the divinity with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries

of all human and ancient opinions concerning religion that seems to me the most likely and most excusable that acknowledged god as an incomprehensible power the original and preserver of all things all goodness all perfection receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him under what method name or ceremonies soever—

               jupiter omnipotens rerum regumque demque
            progenitor genitrixque

                jove the almighty author of all things
         the father mother of both gods and kings
this zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye all governments have reaped fruit from their devotion impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events pagan histories acknowledge dignity order justice prodigies and oracles employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions god through his mercy vouchsafing by these temporal benefits to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him through the deceiving images of their dreams not only deceiving and false but impious also and injurious are those that man has forged from his own invention and of all the religions that st paul found in repute at athens that which they had dedicated to the unknown god seemed to him the most to be excused

pythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite without limitation without declaration that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity but if numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project to attach them to a religion purely mental without any prefixed object and material mixture he undertook a thing of no use the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model the divine majesty has thus in some sort suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage his supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition his adoration is by sensible offices and words for tis man that believes and prays i shall omit the other arguments upon this subject but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes that the picture of our saviours passion that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts and that emotion of the senses do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect

of those to whom they have given a body as necessity required in that universal blindness i should i fancy most incline to those who adored the sun—

               la lumire commune
          loil du monde et si dieu au chef porte des yeux
           les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux
            qui donnent vie  touts nous maintiennent et gardent
           et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent
          ce beau ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons
         selon quil entre ou sort de ses douze maisons
         qui remplit lunivers de ses vertus cognues
          qui dun traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues
           lesprit lame du monde ardent et flamboyant
           en la course dun jour tout le ciel tournoyant
           plein dimmense grandeur rond vagabond et ferme
            lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme
          en repos sans repos oysif et sans sjour
         fils aisn de nature et le pre du jour

                the common light that equal shines on all
           diffused around the whole terrestrial ball
           and if the almighty ruler of the skies
          has eyes the sunbeams are his radiant eyes
           that life and safety give to young and old
            and all mens actions upon earth behold
           this great this beautiful the glorious sun
           who makes their course the varied seasons run
         that with his virtues fills the universe
           and with one glance can sullen clouds disperse
          earths life and soul that flaming in his sphere
          surrounds the heavens in one days career
         immensely great moving yet firm and round
         who the whole world below has made his bound
         at rest without rest idle without stay
         natures first son and father of the day
forasmuch as beside this grandeur and beauty of his tis the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it

thales who first inquired into this sort of matter believed god to be a spirit that made all things of water anaximander that the gods were always dying and entering into life again and that there were an infinite number of worlds anaximines that the air was god that he was procreate and immense always moving anaxagoras the first was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit alcmon gave divinity to the sun moon and stars and to the soul pythagoras made god a spirit spread over the nature of all things whence our souls are extracted parmenides a circle surrounding the heaven and supporting the world by the ardour of light empedocles pronounced the four elements of which all things are composed to be gods protagoras had nothing to say whether they were or were not or what they were democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods another while the nature that darts out those images and then our science and intelligence plato divides his belief into several opinions he says in his timus that the father of the world cannot be named in his laws that men are not to inquire into his being and elsewhere in the very same books he makes the world the heavens the stars the earth and our souls gods admitting moreover those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic

xenophon reports a like perplexity in socratess doctrine one while that men are not to inquire into the form of god and presently makes him maintain that the sun is god and the soul god that there is but one god and then that there are many speusippus the nephew of plato makes god a certain power governing all things and that he has a soul aristotle one while says it is the spirit and another the world one while he gives the world another master and another while makes god the heat of heaven zenocrates makes eight five named amongst the planets the sixth composed of all the fixed stars as of so many members the seventh and eighth the sun and moon heraclides ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion and finally deprives god of sense and makes him shift from one form to another and at last says that it is heaven and earth theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding another while to heaven and then to the stars strato says that tis nature she having the power of generation augmentation and diminution without form and sentiment zeno says tis the law of nature commanding good and prohibiting evil which law is an animal and takes away the accustomed gods jupiter juno and vesta diogenes apolloniates that tis air zenophanes makes god round seeing and hearing not breathing and having nothing in common with human nature aristo thinks the form of god to be incomprehensible deprives him of sense and knows not whether he be an animal or something else cleanthes one while supposes it to be reason another while the world another the soul of nature and then the supreme heat rolling about and environing all perseus zenos disciple was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful and have added any notable advantage to human life and even to profitable things themselves chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories and reckons amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes the men also that have been deified diagoras and theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all epicurus makes the gods shining transparent and perflable lodged as betwixt two forts betwixt two worlds secure from blows clothed in a human figure and with such members as we have which members are to them of no use—

              ego deum genus esse semper duxi et dicam colitum
         sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus

              i ever thought that gods above there were
         but do not think they care what men do here

trust to your philosophy my masters and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads the perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me nor so much make me proud as they humble me in comparing them and all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of god seems to me a choice of very little privilege the policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant nor more blind and inconsiderate than our reason the things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified wherefore to make gods of ourselves as the ancients did exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding i would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent the dog or the ox forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties but to have made gods of our own condition of whom we ought to know the imperfections and to have attributed to them desire anger revenge marriages generation alliances love jealousy our members and bones our fevers and pleasures our death and obsequies this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding

              qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant
          inque dem numro qu sint indigna videri

              from divine natures these so distant are
         they are unworthy of that character
formo otates vestitus omatus noti sunt genera conjugia cognationes omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis humano nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur accipimus enim deorurn cupiditates cegritudines iracundias their forms ages clothes and ornaments are known their descents marriages and kindred and all adapted to the similitude of human weakness for they are represented to us with anxious minds and we read of the lusts sickness and anger of the gods as having attributed divinity not only to faith virtue honour concord liberty victory and piety but also to voluptuousness fraud death envy old age misery to fear fever ill fortune and other injuries of our frail and transitory life—

              quid juvat hoc templis nostros inducere mores
         o curv in terris anim et colestium inanes

               o earthborn souls by earthborn passions led
         to every spark of heavnly influence dead
         think ye that what man values will inspire
         in minds celestial the same base desire
the egyptians with an impudent prudence interdicted upon pain of hanging that any one should say that their gods serapis and isis had formerly been men and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such and their effigies represented with the finger upon the mouth signified says varro that mysterious decree to their priests to conceal their mortal original as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to god he had done better says cicero to have attracted those divine conditions to himself and drawn them down hither below than to send his corruption and misery up on high but to take it right he has several ways done both the one and the other with like vanity of opinion

when philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances offices and power i cannot believe they speak as they think when plato describes plutos orchard to us and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies and accommodates them to the feeling we have in this life—

                secreti celant calles et myrtea circum
         sylva tegit cur non ips in morte relinquunt

              in secret vales and myrtle groves they lie
         nor do cares leave them even when they die
when mahomet promises his followers a paradise hung with tapestry gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones furnished with wenches of excelling beauty rare wines and delicate dishes it is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their promises to our sensuality to attract and allure us by hopes and opinions suitable to our mortal appetites and yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures can we believe that plato he who had such heavenly conceptions and was so well acquainted with the divinity as thence to derive the name of the divine plato ever thought that the poor creature man had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable or the force of our understanding sufficient to participate of beatitude or eternal pains we should then tell him from human reason if the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that i have enjoyed here below this has nothing in common with infinity though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire we know what all this amounts to all this would be nothing if there be any thing of mine there there is nothing divine if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition it cannot be of any value all contentment of mortals is mortal even the knowledge of our parents children and friends if that can affect and delight us in the other world if that still continues a satisfaction to us there we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences we cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises if we could in any sort conceive them to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable inexplicable and incomprehensible and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience eye hath not seen saith st paul nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things that god hath prepared for them that love him and if to render us capable our being were reformed and changed as thou plato sayest by thy purifications it ought to be so extreme and total a change that by physical doctrine it be no more us—

                hector erat tunc cum bello certabat at ille
          tractus ab monio non erat hector eqao

               he hector was whilst he could fight but when
          draggd by achilles steeds no hector then
it must be something else that must receive these recompenses—

              quod mutatur dissolvitur interit ergo
         trajiciuntur enim partes atque ordine migrant

             things changed dissolved are and therefore die
         their parts are mixd and from their order fly
for in pythagorass metempsychosis and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls can we believe that the lion in whom the soul of csar is enclosed does espouse csars passions or that the lion is he for if it was still csar they would be in the right who controverting this opinion with plato reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule and the like absurdities and can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind the new comers are not other than their predecessors from the ashes of a phoenix a worm they say is engendered and from that another phoenix who can imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first we see our silkworms as it were die and wither and from this withered body a butterfly is produced and from that another worm how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this was still the first that which once has ceased to be is no more—

              nec si materiam nostram collegerit tas
         post obitum rursumque redegerit ut sita nunc est
         atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit
         pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum
         interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra

              neither tho time should gather and restore
         our matter to the form it was before
         and give again new light to see withal
         would that new figure us concern at all
         or we again ever the same be seen
         our being having interrupted been
and plato when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the recompense of another life thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as little appearance of truth—

              scilicet avolsis radicibus ut nequit ullam
          dispicere ipsa oculus rem seorsum corpore toto

              no more than eyes once from their optics torn
         can ever after any thing discern
for by this account it would no more be man nor consequently us who would be concerned in this enjoyment for we are composed of two principal essential parts the separation of which is the death and ruin of our being—

              inter enim jecta est vital pausa vageque
         deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes

              when once that pause of life is come between
           tis just the same as we had never been
we cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members and that the earth consumes them—

              et nihil hoc ad nos qui coltu conjugioque
         corporis atque anim consistimus uniter apti

             whats that to us for we are only we
         while soul and body in one frame agree
moreover upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice of or reward man after his death and virtuous actions since it was themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them and why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones since themselves have created in him so frail a condition and when with one glance of their will they might prevent him from falling might not epicurus with great colour of human reason object this to plato did he not often save himself with this sentence that it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal she does nothing but err throughout but especially when she meddles with divine things who does more evidently perceive this than we for although we have given her certain and infallible principles and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased god to communicate to us we daily see nevertheless that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path and that she stray from or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church how soon she loses confounds and fetters herself tumbling and floating in this vast turbulent and waving sea of human opinions without restraint and without any determinate end so soon as she loses that great and common road she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths

man cannot be any thing but what he is nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity tis a greater presumption says plutarch in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demigods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to antiquity i believe thought to put a compliment upon and to add something to the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man investing it with his faculties and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities offering it our aliments to eat presenting it with our dances mummeries and farces to divert it with our vestments to cover it and our houses to inhabit coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music with festoons and nosegays and to accommodate it to our vicious passions flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as tiberius sempronius who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in sardinia for a sacrifice to vulcan and paulus milius those of macedonia to mars and minerva and alexander arriving at the indian ocean threw several great vessels of gold into the sea in honour of thetes and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only but of men also as several nations and ours among the rest were commonly used to do and i believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same—

               sulmone creatos
         quatuor hc juvenes totidem quos educat ufens
         viventes rapit inferias quos immolet umbris

              four sons of sulmo four whom ufens bred
          he took in flight and living victims led
         to please the ghost of pallas and expire
         in sacrifice before his funral pyre
the get hold themselves to be immortal and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god zamolxis every five years they dispatch some one among them to him to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of this envoy is chosen by lot and the form of dispatching him after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver is that of the assistants three hold up as many javelins upon which the rest throw his body with all their force if he happen to be wounded in a mortal part and that he immediately dies tis held a certain argument of divine favour but if he escapes he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead amestris the mother of xerxes being grown old caused at once fourteen young men of the best families of persia to be buried alive according to the religion of the country to gratify some infernal deity and even to this day the idols of themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls a justice thirsty of innocent blood—

              tantum religio potuit suadere maloram

         such impious use was of religion made
         so many demon acts it could persuade
the carthaginians immolated their own children to saturn and those who had none of their own bought of others the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance

it was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions like the lacedemonians who regaled their diana with the tormenting of young boys whom they caused to be whipped for her sake very often to death it was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent and that poor iphigenia at the port of aulis should by her death and immolation acquit towards god the whole army of the greeks from all the crimes they had committed

               et casta inceste nubendi tempore in ipso
         hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis

              that the chaste virgin in her nuptial band
         should die by an unnatral fathers hand
and that the two noble and generous souls of the two decii the father and the son to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of rome should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas ut placari populo romano non possent nisi tales viri occidissent how great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of rome unless such men perished to which may be added that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time but that it purely belongs to the judge who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers the divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us both for its justice and for our own penalty and therefore it was a ridiculous humour of polycrates tyrant of samos who to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune and to balance it went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune and she to mock his folly ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands found in the belly of a fish and then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the corybantes the menades and in our times of the mahometans who slash their faces bosoms and limbs to gratify their prophet seeing that the offence lies in the will not in the breast eyes genitals roundness of form the shoulders or the throat tantus est perturbto mentis et sedibus suis pilso furor ut sic dii placentur quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt so great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve the use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us but also to the service of god and other men tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon and to destroy the functions of the body that are stupid and servile to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason ubi iratos deos timent qui sic propitios habere merentur in regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam sed nemo sibi ne vir esset jubente domino mantis intulit where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate some indeed have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes but no man at his masters command has put his own hand to unman himself so did they fill their religion with several ill effects—

         spius olim religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta

         in elder times religion did commit most fearful crimes
now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto the divine nature which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection

how can that infinite beauty power and goodness admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness infirmum dei fortius est hominibs et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus for the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men stilpo the philosopher being asked whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices—you are indiscreet answered he let us withdraw apart if you would talk of such things nevertheless we prescribe him bounds we keep his power besieged by our reasons i call our ravings and dreams reason with the dispensation of philosophy which says that the wicked man and even the fool go mad by reason but a particular form of reason we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings—him who has made both us and our knowledge because that nothing is made of nothing god therefore could not make the world without matter what has god put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge put the case o man that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged if indeed thou dost see so much whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond this part is nothing in comparison of the whole—

                omnia cum colo terrque manque
           nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem

               the earth the sea and skies from pole to pole
           are small nay nothing to the mighty whole
tis a municipal law that thou allegest thou knowest not what is universal tie thyself to that to which thou art subject but not him he is not of thy brotherhood thy fellowcitizen or companion if he has in some sort communicated himself unto thee tis not to debase himself unto thy littleness nor to make thee comptroller of his power the human body cannot fly to the clouds rules are for thee the sun runs every day his ordinary course the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded the water is unstable and without firmness a wall unless it be broken is impenetrable to a solid body a man cannot preserve his life in the flames he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth and corporally in a thousand places at once tis for thee that he has made these rules tis thee that they concern he has manifested to christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him and in truth why almighty as he is should he have limited his power within any certain bounds in favour of whom should he have renounced his privilege thy reason has in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that there is a plurality of worlds—

                 terramque et solem lunam mare estera quo rant
           non esse unica sed numro magis innumerali

                  that earth sun moon sea and the rest that are
           not single but innumerable were
the most eminent minds of elder times believed it and some of this age of ours compelled by the appearances of human reason do the same forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and one

          cum in summ res nulla sit una
           unica quo gignatur et unica solaque crescat

                since nothings single in this mighty place
           that can alone beget alone increase
and that all the kinds are multiplied in some number by which it seems not to be likely that god should have made this work only without a companion and that the matter of this form should have been totally drained in this individual

               quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est
           esse alios alibi congressus materiali
          qualis hic est avido complexu quem tenet ther

               wherefore tis necessary to confess
          that there must elsewhere be the like congress
          of the like matter which the airy space
          holds fast within its infinite embrace
especially if it be a living creature which its motions render so credible that plato affirms it and that many of our people do either confirm or dare not deny it no more than that ancient opinion that the heavens the stars and other members of the world are creatures composed of body and soul mortal in respect of their composition but immortal by the determination of the creator now if there be many worlds as democritus epicurus and almost all philosophy has believed what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest they may peradventure have another form and another polity epicurus supposes them either like or unlike we see in this world an infinite difference and variety only by distance of places neither com wine nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers tis all there another thing and in times past do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of bacchus or ceres if pliny and herodotus are to be believed there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us mongrel and ambiguous forms betwixt the human and brutal natures there are countries where men are bom without heads having their mouth and eyes in their breast where they are all hermaphrodites where they go on all four where they have but one eye in the forehead and a head more like a dog than like ours where they are half fish the lower part and live in the water where the women bear at five years old and live but eight where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it but rebounds again where men have no beards nations that know not the use of fire others that eject seed of a black colour what shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves colts and then into men again and if it be true as plutarch says that in some place of the indies there are men without mouths who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours how many of our descriptions are false he is no longer risible nor perhaps capable of reason and society the disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose and of no use

moreover how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature and yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto god himself how many things do we call miraculous and contrary to nature this is done by every nation and by every man according to the proportion of his ignorance how many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover for for us to go according to nature is no more but to go according to our understanding as far as that is able to follow and as far as we are able to see into it all beyond that is forsooth monstrous and irregular now by this account all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation not so much as to be assured that snow is white and anaxagoras affirmed it to be black if there be any thing or if there be nothing if there be knowledge or ignorance which metrodorus of chios denied that man was able to determine or whether we live as euripides doubts whether the life we live is life or whether that we call death be not life —greek— and not without some appearance for why do we derive the title of being from this instant which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition death possessing all the before and after this moment and also a good part of the moment itself others swear there is no motion at all as followers of melissus and that nothing stirs for if there be but one neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him nor motion from one place to another as plato proves that there is neither generation nor corruption in nature protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt that a man may equally dispute of all things and even of this whether a man can equally dispute of all things nausiphanes that of things which seem to be nothing is more than it is not that there is nothing certain but uncertainty parmenides that of that which seems there is no one thing in general that there is but one thing zeno that one same is not and that there is nothing if there were one thing it would either be in another or in itself if it be in another they are two if it be in itself they are yet two the comprehending and the comprehended according to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow either false or vain

this way of speaking in a christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent god cannot die god cannot contradict himself god cannot do this or that i do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of mens mouths and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed

our speaking has its failings and defects as well as all the rest most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes how many quarrels and of how great importance has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable hoc created in the world let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself

             montaigne here refers to the controversies between
              the catholics and protestants about transubstantiation
presents us withal if you say it is fine weather and that you say true it is then fine weather is not this a very certain form of speaking and yet it will deceive us that it will do so let us follow the example if you say i lie if you say true you do lie the art the reason and force of the conclusion of this are the same with the other and yet we are gravelled the pyrrhonian philosophers i see cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking for they would require a new language on purpose ours is all formed of affirmative propositions which are totally antarctic to them insomuch that when they say i doubt they are presently taken by the throat to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt by which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison without which their humour would be inexplicable when they pronounce i know not or i doubt they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest no more nor less than rhubarb that drives out the ill humours and carries itself off with them this fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation what do i know as i bear it with the emblem of a balance

see what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking in the present disputes about our religion if you press its adversaries too hard they will roundly tell you that it is not in the power of god to make it so that his body should be in paradise and upon earth and in several places at once and see too what advantage the old scoffer made of this at least says he it is no little consolation to man to see that god cannot do all things for he cannot kill himself though he would which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition he cannot make mortal immortal nor revive the dead nor make it so that he who has lived has not nor that he who has had honours has not had them having no other right to the past than that of oblivion and that the comparison of man to god may yet be made out by jocose examples he cannot order it so says he that twice ten shall not be twenty this is what he says and what a christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips whereas on the contrary it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language to reduce god to their own measure—

                cras vel atr nube polum pater occupato
          vel sole puro non tamen irritum
          quodcumque retro est efficiet neque
           diffinget infectumque reddet
            quod fugiens semel hora vexit

               tomorrow let it shine or rain
           yet cannot this the past make vain

when we say that the infinity of ages as well past as to come are but one instant with god that his goodness wisdom and power are the same with his essence our mouths speak it but our understandings apprehend it not and yet such is our vain opinion of ourselves that we must make the divinity to pass through our sieve and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani parvulo aliquo intritata successu tis wonderful to what the wickedness of mans heart will proceed if elevated with the least success how magisterially and insolently does epicurus reprove the stoics for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to god and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it how temerariously have they bound god to destiny a thing which by my consent none that bears the name of a christian shall ever do again and thales plato and pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity this arrogance of attempting to discover god with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the divinity a corporal form and is the reason of what happens to us every day of attributing to god important events by a particular assignment because they weigh with us they conclude that they also weigh with him and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course magna dii curant parva negligunt the gods are concerned at great matters but slight the small listen to him he will clear this to you by his reason nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns as if to that king of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom or to move the leaf of a tree or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea the hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner with the same power and order our interest does nothing towards it our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him deus ita artifex magnus in magnis ut minor non sit in parvis god is so great an artificer in great things that he is no less in the least our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us because our employments are a burden to us strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices as their priests are he makes nature produce and support all things and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments quod beatum terumque sit id nec habere negotii quicquam nec exhibere alteri what is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another nature will that in like things there should be a like relation the infinite number of mortals therefore concludes a like number of immortals the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit as the souls of the gods without tongue eye or ear do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels and judge our thoughts so the souls of men when at liberty and loosed from the body either by sleep or some ecstacy divine foretell and see things which whilst joined to the body they could not see men says st paul professing themselves to be wise they become fools and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications after the great and stately pomp of the funeral so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay they at the same time turned out an eagle which flying upward signified that the soul went into paradise we have a thousand medals and particularly of the worthy faustina where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions

          quod finxere timent

          they fear their own inventions
like children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow that they themselves have smeared and smutted quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine cui sua figmenta dominantur

as if any thing could be more unhappy than man who is insulted over by his own imagination tis far from honouring him who made us to honour him that we have made augustus had more temples than jupiter served with as much religion and belief of miracles the thracians in return of the benefits they had received from agesilaus came to bring him word that they had canonized him has your nation said he to them the power to make gods of whom they please pray first deify some one amongst yourselves and when i shall see what advantage he has by it i will thank you for your offer man is certainly stark mad he cannot make a worm and yet he will be making gods by dozens hear trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency of all the wonderful things it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it and take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself—

               nosse cui divos et coli munina soli
          aut soli nescire datum

               to whom to know the deities of heaven
          or know he knows them not alone tis given
if there is a god he is a living creature if he be a living creature he has sense and if he has sense he is subject to corruption if he be without a body he is without a soul and consequently without action and if he has a body it is perishable is not here a triumph we are incapable of having made the world there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work it were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe there must then be something that is better and that must be god when you see a stately and stupendous edifice though you do not know who is the owner of it you would yet conclude it was not built for rats and this divine structure that we behold of the celestial palace have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor who is much greater than we is not the most supreme always the most worthy but we are in the lowest form nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason the world produces us the world then has soul and reason every part of us is less than we we are part of the world the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason and that more abundantly than we tis a fine thing to have a great government the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature the stars do us no harm they are then full of goodness we have need of nourishment then so have the gods also and feed upon the vapours of the earth worldly goods are not goods to god therefore they are not goods to us offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility tis therefore folly to fear god god is good by his nature man by his industry which is more the divine and human wisdom have no other distinction but that the first is eternal but duration is no accession to wisdom therefore we are companions we have life reason and liberty we esteem goodness charity and justice these qualities are then in him in conclusion building and destroying the conditions of the divinity are forged by man according as they relate to himself what a pattern and what a model let us stretch let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please puff up thyself poor man yet more and more and more—

           non si tu ruperis inquit

          not if thou burst said he
profecto non deum quern cogitare non possunt sed semetip pro illo cogitantes non ilium sed seipsos non illi sed sibi comparant certainly they do not imagine god whom they cannot imagine but they imagine themselves in his stead they do not compare him but themselves not to him but to themselves in natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes whats this to the purpose his condition is above the order of nature too elevated too remote and too mighty to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place our ways lie too low we are no nearer heaven on the top of mount cenis than at the bottom of the sea take the distance with your astrolabe they debase god even to the carnal knowledge of women to so many times and so many generations paulina the wife of satuminus a matron of great reputation at rome thinking she lay with the god serapis found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers through the panderism of the priests of his temple varro the most subtle and most learned of all the latin authors in his book of theology writes that the sexton of herculess temple throwing dice with one hand for himself and with the other for hercules played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench if he won at the expense of the offerings if he lost at his own the sexton lost and paid the supper and the wench her name was laurentina who saw by night this god in her arms who moreover told her that the first she met the next day should give her a heavenly reward which proved to be taruncius a rich young man who took her home to his house and in time left her his inheritrix she in her turn thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god left the people of rome heirs to her and therefore had divine honours attributed to her as if it had not been sufficient that plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line and that he had neptune for the common father of his race it was certainly believed at athens that aristo having a mind to enjoy the fair perictione could not and was warned by the god apollo in a dream to leave her unpolluted and untouched till she should first be brought to bed these were the father and mother of plato how many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings committed by the gods against poor mortal men and how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children in the mahometan religion there are merlins enough found by the belief of the people that is to say children without fathers spiritual divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins and carry names that signify so much in their language

we are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being the lion the eagle the dolphin prize nothing above their own kind and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities which we may indeed extend or contract but thats all for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go can guess at nothing else nor possibly go out thence nor stretch beyond it whence spring these ancient conclusions of all forms the most beautiful is that of man therefore god must be of that form no one can be happy without virtue nor virtue be without reason and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape god is therefore clothed in a human figure ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris ut homini quum de deo cogitet forma occurrat humana it is so imprinted in our minds and the fancy is so prepossessed with it that when a man thinks of god a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination therefore it was that xenophanes pleasantly said that if beasts frame any gods to themselves as tis likely they do they make them certainly such as themselves are and glorify themselves in it as we do for why may not a goose say thus all the parts of the universe i have an interest in the earth serves me to walk upon the sun to light me the stars have their influence upon me i have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me i am the darling of nature is it not man that keeps lodges and serves me tis for me that he both sows and grinds if he eats me he does the same by his fellowmen and so do i the worms that kill and devour him as much might be said by a crane and with greater confidence upon the account of the liberty of his flight and the possession of that high and beautiful region tam blanda conciliatrix et tam sui est lena ipsa natura so flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself

now by the same consequence the destinies are then for us for us the world it shines it thunders for us creator and creatures all are for us tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more of the affairs of heaven the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man she does not allow them any other consultation or occupation see them here against us in war—

          the brawny sons of earth subdud by hand
          of hercules on the phlegran strand
          where the rude shock did such an uproar make
          as made old saturns sparkling palace shake
and here you shall see them participate of our troubles to make a return for our having so often shared in theirs—

          neptunus muros magnoque emota tridenti

          and heaves the city from its solid base
          see where in arms the cruel juno stands
           full in the scan gate
the caunians jealous of the authority of their own proper gods armed themselves on the days of their devotion and through the whole of their precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords by that means to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory their powers are limited according that the plague that the scurf that the phthisic one cures one sort of itch another another adeo minimis etiam rebus prava religio inserit deos at such a rate does false religion create gods for the most contemptible uses this one makes grapes grow that onions this has the presidence over lechery that over merchandise for every sort of artisan a god this has his province and reputation in the east that his in the west—

there are amongst them physicians poets and civilians some of a mean betwixt the divine and human nature mediators betwixt god and us adorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration infinite in titles and offices some good others ill some old and decrepit and some that are mortal for chrysippus was of opinion that in the last conflagration of the world all the gods were to die but jupiter man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt god and him is he not his countryman

          jovis incunabula creten

          crete the cradle of jupiter
and this is the excuse that upon consideration of this subject scvola a high priest and varro a great theologian in their times make us that it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true and believe many things that are false quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur seeing he inquires into the truth by which he would be made free tis fit he should be deceived human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know and we do not remember what a leap miserable phton took for attempting to guide his fathers horses with a mortal hand the mind of man falls into as great a depth and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness if you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are what answer will she return if not that it is iron or with anaxagoras stone or some other matter that she makes use of if a man inquire of zeno what nature is a fire says he an artisan proper for generation and regularly proceeding archimedes master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty the sun says he is a god of redhot iron was not this a fine imagination extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations yet not so inevitable and useful but that socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold and that polynus who had been a great and famous doctor in it despised it as full of falsity and manifest vanity after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of epicurus socrates in xenophon concerning this affair says of anaxagoras reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters that he had cracked his brain as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them when he made the sun to be a burning stone he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire and which is worse that it will there consume and in making the sun and fire one that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them that we are able to look fixedly upon fire and that fire kills herbs and plants tis socratess opinion and mine too that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all plato having occasion in his timous to speak of the demons this undertaking says he exceeds my ability we are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them tis against all reason to refuse a mans faith to the children of the gods though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things

let us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom by our own confession our knowledge is not able to attain another body and to lend a false form of our own invention as is manifest in this motion of the planets to which seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive nor conceive their natural conduct we lend them material heavy and substantial springs of our own by which to move—

                temo aureus aurea summ
            curvatura rot radiorum argenteus ordo

                gold was the axle and the beam was gold
           the wheels with silver spokes on golden circles rolld
you would say that we had had coachmakers carpenters and painters that went up on high to make engines of various motions and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity according to plato—

               mundus domus est maxima rerum
          quam quinque altiton fragmine zon
          cingunt per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis
          stellimicantibus altus in obliquo there lun
          bigas acceptat

               the worlds a mansion that doth all things hold
          which thundering zones in number five enfold
          through which a girdle painted with twelve signs
          and that with sparkling constellations shines
          in heavens arch marks the diurnal course
          for the suns chariot and his fiery horse
these are all dreams and fanatic follies why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements and prepare our eyes to see them good god what abuse what mistakes should we discover in our poor science i am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is and i shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance

have i not read in plato this divine saying that nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy as if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit qu penetrare in coelum terram intrare possit all those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth and certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets and the first of them were poets themselves and writ accordingly plato is but a poet unripped timon calls him insultingly a monstrous forger of miracles all superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump and in the sight of every one do paint patch and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty so does science and even our law itself has they say legitimate fictions whereon it builds the truth of its justice she gives us in presupposition and for current pay things which she herself informs us were invented for these epicycles eccentrics and concentrics which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject as also in all the rest philosophy presents us not that which really is or what she really believes but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth and the quaintest invention plato upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts says i should know that what i have said is truth had i the confirmation of an oracle but this i will affirm that what i have said is the most likely to be true of any thing i could say

tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes engines and wheels let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves and of our contexture

there is not more retrogradation trepidation accession recession and astonishment in the stars and celestial bodies than they have found out in this poor little human body in earnest they have good reason upon that very account to call it the little world so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it to assist the motions they see in man and the various functions that we find in ourselves in how many parts have they divided the soul in how many places lodged it in how many orders have they divided and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature man besides those that are natural and to be perceived and how many offices and vocations have they assigned him they make it an imaginary public thing tis a subject that they hold and handle and they have full power granted to them to rip place displace piece and stuff it every one according to his own fancy and yet they possess it not they cannot not in reality only but even in dreams so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture as enormous as it is and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches and it is not reason to excuse them for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven earth seas mountains and remote islands that they give us some slight mark of them and as of things unknown are content with a faint and obscure description yet when they come and draw us after life or any other creature which is known and familiar to us we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours and despise them if they fail in it

i am very well pleased with the milesian girl who observing the philosopher thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch and to have his eyes ever gazing upward laid something in his way that he might stumble over to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet doubtless she advised him well rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven for as democritus says by the mouth of cicero—

             quod est ante pedes nemo spectat coeli scrutantur plagas

                  no man regards what is under his feet
             they are always prying towards heaven
but our condition will have it so that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us and as much above the clouds as that of the stars as socrates says in plato that whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as thales was by the woman that he sees nothing of that which is before him for every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does aye and of what he does himself and is ignorant of what they both are whether beasts or men

those people who find sebonds arguments too weak that are ignorant of nothing that govern the world that know all—

                qu mare compescant caus quid temperet annum
           stell sponte su jussve vagentur et errent
          quid premat obscurum lun quid profrt orbem
          quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors

                what governs oceans tides
          and through the various year the seasons guides
          whether the stars by their own proper force
           or foreign power pursue their wandring course
          why shadows darken the pale queen of night
           whence she renews her orb and spreads her light—
          what natures jarring sympathy can mean
have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being we see very well that the finger moves that the foot moves that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent and that others work by our direction that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing another paleness such an imagination works upon the spleen only another upon the brain one occasions laughter another tears another stupefies and astonishes all our senses and arrests the motion of all our members at one object the stomach will rise at another a member that lies something lower but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements never yet man knew omnia incerta ratione et in natur majestate abdita all uncertain in reason and concealed in the majesty of nature says pliny and st augustin modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus omnino minis est nec comprehendi ab homine potest et hoc ipse homo est the manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful and cannot be conceived by man and yet this is man and yet it is not so much as doubted for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief by authority and upon trust as if it were religion and law tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken this truth with all its clutter of arguments and proofs is admitted as a firm and solid body that is no more to be shaken no more to be judged of on the contrary every one according to the best of his talent corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason which is a supple utensil pliable and to be accommodated to any figure and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies the reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions they do not dig to the root where the faults and defects lie they only debate upon the branches they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true but if it has been so and so understood it is not inquired into whether galen has said any thing to purpose but whether he has said so or so in truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions should be extended to the schools and arts the god of scholastic knowledge is aristotle tis irreligion to question any of his decrees as it was those of lucurgus at sparta his doctrine is a magisterial law which peradventure is as false as another i do not know why i should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of plato or the atoms of epicurus or the plenum or vacuum of leucippus and democritus or the water of thales or the infinity of nature of anaximander or the air of diogenes or the numbers and symmetry of pythagoras or the infinity of parmenides or the one of musus or the water and fire of apollodorus or the similar parts of anaxagoras or the discord and friendship of empedocles or the fire of heraclitus or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal as i should the opinion of aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things which principles he builds of three pieces—matter form and privation and what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things privation is a negative of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are and yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections his authority is the nonultra beyond which it is not permitted to inquire

it is very easy upon approved foundations to build whatever we please for according to the law and ordering of this beginning the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure by this way we find our reason wellgrounded and discourse at a venture for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please as geometricians do by their granted demands the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left and to whirl us about at their pleasure whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our god he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds if he so please in this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of pythagoras that every expert person ought to be believed in his own art for current pay the logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician the poet his measure from the musician the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations for every science has its principle presupposed by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check if you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies they have presently this sentence in their mouths that there is no disputing with persons who deny principles now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity of all the rest the beginning the middle and the end is nothing but dream and vapour to those that contend upon presupposition we must on the contrary presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is for every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another if reason do not make the difference wherefore they are all to be put into the balance and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us the persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty and there are not a more foolish sort of men nor that are less philosophers than the philodoxes of plato we must inquire whether fire be hot whether snow be white if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge

and as to those answers of which they make old stories as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat whom they bid throw himself into the fire and he that denied the coldness of ice whom they bid to put ice into his bosom—they are pitiful things unworthy of the profession of philosophy if they had let us alone in our natural being to receive the appearance of things without us according as they present themselves to us by our senses and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites governed by the condition of our birth they might then have reason to talk at that rate but tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world tis from them that we derive this fancy that human reason is controllergeneral of all that is without and within the roof of heaven that comprehends every thing that can do every thing by the means of which every thing is known and understood this answer would be good among the cannibals who enjoy the happiness of a long quiet and peaceable life without aristotles precepts and without the knowledge of the name of physics this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention of this all animals and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple would be as capable as we but as for them they have renounced it they need not tell us it is true for you see and feel it to be so they must tell me whether i really feel what i think i do and if i do feel it they must then tell me why i feel it and how and what let them tell me the name original the parts and junctures of heat and cold the qualities of the agent and patient or let them give up their profession which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason that is their test in all sorts of essays but certainly tis a test full of falsity error weakness and defect

which way can we better prove it than by itself if we are not to believe her when speaking of herself she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things if she know any thing it must at least be her own being and abode she is in the soul and either a part or an effect of it for true and essential reason from which we by a false colour borrow the name is lodged in the bosom of the almighty there is her habitation and recess tis thence that she imparts her rays when god is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind as balias issued from her fathers head to communicate herself to the world

now let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul not of the soul in general of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants nor of that which thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone but of that which appertains to us and that we ought the best to know—

                    ignoratur enim qu sit natura animai
             nata sit an contra nascentibus insinuetur
             et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta
            an tenebras orci visat vastasque lacunas
            an pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se

                for none the nature of the soul doth know
            whether that it be born with us or no
           or be infused into us at our birth
           and dies with us when we return to earth
           or then descends to the black shades below
           or into other animals does go
crates and dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion plato that it was a substance moving of itself thales a nature without repose aedepiades an exercising of the senses hesiod and anaximander a thing composed of earth and water parmenides of earth and fire empedocles of blood—

          sanguineam vomit ille animam

let us not forget aristotle who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move which he calls entelechia with as cold an invention as any of the rest for he neither speaks of the essence nor of the original nor of the nature of the soul but only takes notice of the effect lactantius seneca and most of the dogmatists have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand after all this enumeration of opinions harum sententiarum quo vera sit deus aliquis viderit of these opinions which is the true let some god determine says cicero i know by myself says st bernard how incomprehensible god is seeing i cannot comprehend the parts of my own being

heraclitus who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it so profound was the essence of it

neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it hippocrates and hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain democritus and aristotle throughout the whole body—


               ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse
           corporis et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis

                as when the bodys health they do it call
          when of a sound man thats no part at all
epicurus in the stomach

               hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus
          hc loca circum ltiti mulcent

               for this the seat of horror is and fear
          and joys in turn do likewise triumph here
the stoics about and within the heart erasistratus adjoining the membrane of the epicranium empedocles in the blood as also moses which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts because the soul is there seated galen thought that every part of the body had its soul strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows qu facie quidem sit animus aut ubi habitet ne quorendum quidem est what figure the soul is of or what part it inhabits is not to be inquired into says cicero i very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words for should i alter eloquence itself besides it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions they are neither very frequent nor of any great weight and sufficiently known but the reason why chrysippus argues it to be about the heart as all the rest of that sect do is not to be omitted it is says he because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts and when we would pronounce y which signifies i we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach this place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves the last is only a proof to the greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part no human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep why do we fear to say the stoics the fathers of human prudence think that the soul of a man crushed under a ruin long labours and strives to get out like a mouse caught in a trap before it can disengage itself from the burden some hold that the world was made to give bodies by way of punishment to the spirits fallen by their own fault from the purity wherein they had been created the first creation having been incorporeal and that according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter but the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change

the extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness as plutarch says of the testimony of histories that according to charts and maps the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes impenetrable forests deserts and uninhabitable places this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects and proceed the furthest in them losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption the beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish observe to what a pitch plato flies in his poetic clouds do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be a twolegged animal without feathers giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion for having pulled a capon alive they went about calling it the man of plato

and what did the epicureans think of out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight and a natural motion downwards had made the world till they were put in mind by their adversaries that according to this description it was impossible they should unite and join to one another their fall being so direct and perpendicular and making so many parallel lines throughout wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails by which they might unite and cling to one another and even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it if the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of greek letters strewed all over a certain place might fall into the contexture of the iliad—whatever is capable of reason says zeno is better than that which is not capable there is nothing better than the world the world is therefore capable of reason cotta by this way of argumentation makes the world a mathematician and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of zeno the whole is more than a part we are capable of wisdom and are part of the world therefore the world is wise there are infinite like examples not only of arguments that are false in themselves but silly ones that do not hold in themselves and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions

whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders i willingly muster up these few for a pattern by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man of his sense and reason when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found

for my part i am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually and like a toy with both hands and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions sometimes more sinewy and sometimes weaker this same plato who defines man as if he were a cock says elsewhere after socrates that he does not in truth know what man is and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand by this variety and instability of opinions they tacitly lead us as it were by the hand to this resolution of their irresolution they profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry and at another in some other vizor for our imperfection carries this also along with it that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs we must dry alter and mix it they do the same they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use they will not make an open profession of ignorance and of the imbecility of human reason that they may not fright children but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science

i advised a person in italy who had a great mind to speak italian that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood without being ambitious in any other respect to excel that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongues end whether latin french spanish or gascon and that by adding the italian termination he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country either tuscan roman venetian piedmontese or neapolitan and so fall in with some one of those many forms i say the same of philosophy she has so many faces so much variety and has said so many things that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there nihil tam absurde did potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum nothing can be said so absurd that has not been said before by some of the philosophers and i am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public forasmuch as though they are spun out of myself and without any pattern i know they will be found related to some ancient humour and some will not stick to say see whence he took it my manners are natural i have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them but weak as they are when it came into my head to lay them open to the worlds view and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb i went to adorn them with reasons and examples it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples i never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher

but to return to the soul inasmuch as plato has placed reason in the brain anger in the heart and concupiscence in the liver tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul than that he intended a division and separation of it as of a body into several members and the most likely of their opinions is that tis always a soul that by its faculty reasons remembers comprehends judges desires and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience one while straining or slacking the cordage one while hoisting the mainyard or removing the rudder by one and the same power carrying on several effects and that it is lodged in the brain which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul and tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body

                medium non deserit unquam
          coeli phoebus iter radiis tamen omnia lustrt

                phoebus neer deviates from the zodiacs way
          yet all things doth illustrate with his ray
as the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence and fills the world with them—

               ctera pars animas per totum dissita corpus
           paret et ad numen mentis momenque movetur

               the other part o th soul diffusd all oer
          the body does obey the reasons lore
some have said that there was a general soul as it were a great body whence all the particular souls were extracted and thither again return always restoring themselves to that universal matter—

               deum namque ire per omnes
          terrasque tractusque maris columque profundum
          hinc pecudes armenta viros genus omne ferarum
          quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas
          scilicet hue reddi deinde ac resoluta referri
          omnia nec morti esse locum

               for god goes forth and spreads throughout the whole
          heaven earth and sea the universal soul
          each at its birth from him all beings share
          both man and brute the breath of vital air
          to him return and loosd from earthly chain
          fly whence they sprung and rest in god again
           spurn at the grave and fearless of decay
           dwell in high heaven and star th ethereal way
others that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it others that they were produced from the divine substance others by the angels of fire and air others that they were from all antiquity and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them others make them to descend from the orb of the moon and return thither the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son after a like manner and produced with all other natural things taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers

               instillata patris virtus tibi
          fortes creantur fortibus et bonis

               thou hast thy fathers virtues with his blood
          for still the brave spring from the brave and good
and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks but moreover a resemblance of humours complexions and inclinations of the soul—

                denique cur acris violentia triste leonum
          seminium sequitur dolus vulpibus et fuga cervis
          a patribus datur et patrius pavor incitt artus
          si non certa suo quia semine seminioque
          vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto

               for why should rage from the fierce lions seed
          or from the subtle foxs craft proceed
          or why the timrous and flying hart
          his fear and trembling to his race impart
          but that a certain force of mind does grow
           and still increases as the bodies do
that thereupon the divine justice is grounded punishing in the children the faults of their fathers forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children and that the ill government of their will extends to them moreover that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence and that they had been some other thins out of the body they would retain some memory of their first being the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing reasoning and remembering being considered—

               si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur
          cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus
          nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus

               for at our birth if it infused be
          why do we then retain no memory
          of our foregoing life and why no more
          remember any thing we did before
for to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be we must suppose them allknowing even in their natural simplicity and purity by these means they had been such being free from the prison of the body as well before they entered into it as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember being got in the body as plato said that what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false forasmuch in the first place as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned secondly that which she knew being in her purity was a true knowledge knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence that image and conception having never been planted in her to say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties that they are there utterly extinct is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past and the immortality to come—

               nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas
          omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum
          non ut opinor ea ab letho jam longior errat

               for if the mind be changed to that degree
          as of past things to lose all memory
          so great a change as that i must confess
          appears to me than death but little less
furthermore tis here with us and not elsewhere that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid and of the life of man only that she is to render an account it had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers to have disarmed her in order in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time peradventure but an hour or two or at the most but a century which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being it were an unreasonable disproportion too to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life plato to defend himself from this inconvenience will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years relatively to human duration and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits by this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things as also her life according to the opinion of epicurus and democritus which has been the most received in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom and that according as the body grew more capable they saw it increase in vigour as the other did that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest and in time its better strength and maturity and after that its declension and old age and at last its decrepitude—

               gigni pariter cum corpore et una
          crescere sentimus pariterque senescere mentem

               souls with the bodies to be born we may
          discern with them t increase with them decay
they perceived it to be capable of divers passions and agitated with divers painful motions whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness capable of alteration and change of cheerfulness of stupidity and languor and subject to diseases and injuries as the stomach or the foot

               mentem sanari corpus ut grum
            ceraimus et flecti medicin posse videmus

                sick minds as well as bodies we do see
           by medcines virtue oft restored to be
dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever laid asleep by the application of some medicaments and roused by others—

               corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est
           corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat

               there must be of necessity we find
          a nature thats corporeal of the mind
          because we evidently see it smarts
            and wounded is with shafts the body darts
they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog and in that condition to have no stability of reason no sufficiency no virtue no philosophical resolution no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of socrates to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations and so to annihilate them ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge—

               vis animal conturbatur et divisa seorsum
          disjectatur eodem illo distracta veneno

               the power of the souls disturbed and when
          that once is but sequestered from her then
           by the same poison tis dispersed abroad
and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old a poison sufficient to make all philosophy if it were incarnate become furious and mad insomuch that cato who ever disdained death and fortune could not endure the sight of a lookingglass or of water overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling by the contagion of a mad dog into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia—

              vis morbi distracta per artus
          turbat agens animam spumantes quore salso
         ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und

              throughout the limbs diffused the fierce disease
         disturbs the soul as in the briny seas
         the foaming waves to swell and boil we see
          stirred by the winds impetuosity
now as to this particular philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience or if the search of that costs too dear by an infallible defeat in totally depriving himself of all sentiment but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself and in its full power capable of reason and deliberation but not at all proper for this inconvenience where in a philosopher the soul becomes the soul of a madman troubled overturned and lost which many occasions may produce as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself or a wound in a certain part of the person or vapours from the stomach any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain

                morbis in corporis avius errat
          spe animus dementit enim deliraque fatur
          interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum
         ternumque soporem oculis mi tuque cadenti

         for when the bodys sick and ill at ease
         the mind doth often share in the disease
          wonders grows wild and raves and sometimes by
         a heavy and a stupid lethargy
         is overcome and cast into a deep
         a most profound and everlasting sleep
the philosophers methinks have not much touched this string no more than another of equal importance they have this dilemma continually in their mouths to console our mortal condition the soul is either mortal or immortal if mortal it will suffer no pain if immortal it will change for the better—they never touch the other branch what if she change for the worse and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments but thereby they make themselves a good game these are two omissions that i often meet with in their discourses i return to the first

this soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good so constant and so firm our fine human wisdom must here yield and give up her arms as to the rest they also considered by the vanity of human reason that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal was unimaginable—

              quippe etenim mortale terao jungere et una
         consentire putare et fungi mutua posse
         desipere est quid enim diversius esse putandum est
         aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque
         quam mortale quod est immortali atque perenni
          junctum in concilio svas tolerare procellas

               the mortal and th eternal then to blend
         and think they can pursue one common end
         is madness for what things more diffrent are
         distinct in nature and disposed to jar
         how can it then be thought that these should bear
         when thus conjoined of harms an equal share
moreover they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body—

         simul ovo fessa fatiscit

         fatigued together with the weight of years
which according to zeno the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us for he looks upon it as a fainting and fall of the soul as well as of the body contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere and what they perceived in some that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life they attributed to the variety of diseases as it is observable in men at the last extremity that some retain one sense and some another one the hearing and another the smell without any manner of defect or alteration and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire—

              non alio pacto quam si pes cum dolet gri
         in nullo caput interea sit forte dolore

              so often of the gout a man complains
         whose head is at the same time free from pains
the sight of our judgment is to truth the same that the owls eyes are to the splendour of the sun says aristotle by what can we better convince him than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light for the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul which cicero says was first introduced according to the testimony of books at least by pherecydes

syrius in the time of king tullus though some attribute it to thales and others to others tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and

reservation the most positive dogmatists are fain in this point principally to fly to the refuge of the academy no one doubts what aristotle has established upon this subject no more than all the ancients in general who handle it with a wavering belief rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium a thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers he conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult unintelligible sense and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself

two things rendered this opinion plausible to them one that without the immortality of souls there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory which is a consideration of wonderful

repute in the world the other that it is a very profitable impression as plato says that vices when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice are still within the reach of the divine which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being and has to the utmost of his power provided for it there are monuments for the conservation of the body and glory to preserve the name he has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself impatient of his fortune and to prop himself by his inventions the soul by reason of its anxiety and impotence being unable to stand by itself wanders up and down to seek out consolations hopes and foundations and alien circumstances to which she adheres and fixes and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her relies more willingly and with greater assurance upon them than upon herself but tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short and how weak their arguments are when they go about to prove it by human reason somnia sunt non docentis sed optantis they are dreams not of the teacher but wisher says one of the ancients by which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident since that even then when it is fallen into his hand he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it and that his reason has not force to make use of it all things produced by our own meditation and understanding whether true or false are subject to incertitude and controversy twas for the chastisement of our pride and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity that god wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of babel whatever we undertake without his assistance whatever we see without the lamp of his grace is but vanity and folly we corrupt the very essence of truth which is uniform and constant by our weakness when fortune puts it into our possession what course soever man takes of himself god still permits it to come to the same confusion the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed nimrods presumption and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure perdam sapientiam sapientium et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent the diversity of idioms and tongues with which he disturbed this work what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom and to very good effect too for what would hold us if we had but the least grain of knowledge this saint has very much obliged me ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humilitatis exercitatio est aut elationis attritio the very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption to what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly

but to return to my subject it was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to god only and to the favour of his grace for the truth of so noble a belief since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude let us ingenuously confess that god alone has dictated it to us and faith for tis no lesson of nature and our own reason and whoever will inquire into his own being and power both within and without without this divine privilege whoever shall consider man impartially and without flattery will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth the more we give and confess to owe and render to god we do it with the greater christianity that which this stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice had it not been better that he had held it from god cum de animarum otemitate disserimus non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos aut colentium utor hc public persuasione when we discourse of the immortality of souls the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers is of no small advantage i make use of this public persuasion now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was let us omit the stoics usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus diu mansuros aiunt animos semper negant they give us a long life as also they do to crows they say our soul shall continue long but that it shall continue always they deny who give to souls a life after this but finite the most universal and received fancy and that continues down to our times in various places is that of which they make pythagoras the author not that he was the original inventor but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation that souls at their departure out of us did nothing but shift from one body to another from a lion to a horse from a horse to a king continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation and he himself said that he remembered he had been thalides since that euphorbus afterwards hermotimus and finally from pyrrhus was passed into pythagoras having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years and some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven and come down again—

              o pater aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est
         sublimes animas iterumque ad tarda reverti
          corpora qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido

                o father is it then to be conceivd
         that any of these spirits so sublime
         should hence to the celestial regions climb
          and thence return to earth to reassume
          their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb
          for wretched life whence does such fondness come
origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate the opinion that varro mentions is that after four hundred and forty years revolution they should be reunited to their first bodies chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited plato who professes to have embraced this belief from pindar and the ancient poets that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation for which the soul is prepared having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal as its life here is but temporal concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven of hell of the world through all which it has passed repassed and made stay in several voyages are matters for her memory observe her progress elsewhere the soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned that which has lived ill removes into a woman and if it do not there reform is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution and that it has by the force of reason purged itself from those gross stupid and elementary qualities it was polluted with but i will not omit the objection the epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another tis a pleasant one they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world for the souls turned out of their old habitation would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging and they further demand how they shall pass away their time whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them or on the contrary if more animals should be born than die the body they say would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive

              denique comrabia ad veneris partusque ferarum
         esse animas prsto deridiculum esse videtur
         et spectare immortales mortalia membra
         innumero numro certareque prproperanter
          inter se qu prima potissimaq insinueter

              absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget
         or bear their young a thousand souls do wait
         expect the falling body fight and strive
         which first shall enter in and make it live
others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased with it to animate serpents worms and other beasts which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members and even out of our ashes others divide them into two parts the one mortal the other immortal others make it corporeal and nevertheless immortal some make it immortal without
sense or knowledge there are others even among ourselves who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned as plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression we are told says he and steadfastly should believe that the souls of virtuous men both according to nature and the divine justice become saints and from saints demigods and from demigods after they are perfectly as in sacrifices of purgation cleansed and purified being delivered from all passibility and all mortality they become not by any civil decree but in real truth and according to all probability of reason entire and perfect gods in receiving a most happy and glorious end but who desires to see him—him who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers lay about him with greater boldness and relate his miracles upon this subject i refer him to his treatise of the moon and of the demon of socrates where he may as evidently as in any other place whatever satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom even as we tired and worn out with a long course of life return to infancy and dotage see here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul

neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts let us choose out one or two examples for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors let us first know whether at least they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another for as to their first production it is no wonder if in a thing so high and so long since past human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed archelaus the physician whose disciple and favourite socrates was according to aristoxenus said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime expressed by the heat of the earth pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood plato that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone raising his argument from this that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work alcmeon that it is part of the substance of the brain and that it is so says he is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise democritus that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body epicurus an extract from soul and body aristotle an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood the last which is diffused over our members others that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals which they judge by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood wherein there seems to be more likelihood could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion now to bring this seed to do its work how many contrary opinions do they set on foot aristotle and democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm and that tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion and that contributes nothing at all to generation galen on the contrary and his followers believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation here are the physicians the philosophers the lawyers and divines by the ears with our wives about the dispute for what term women carry their fruit and i for my part by the example of myself stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child the world is built upon this experience there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies and yet we cannot agree

here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself in his corporal than in his spiritual part we have proposed himself to himself and his reason to his reason to see what she could say i think i have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself and who understands not himself in himself in what can he quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere qui sui nesciat as if he could understand the measure of any other thing that knows not his own in earnest protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things that never knew so much as his own and if it be not he his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage now he being so contrary in himself and one judgment so incessantly subverting another this favourable proposition was but a mockery which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser when thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible

you for whom i have taken the pains contrary to my custom to write so long a discourse will not refuse to support your sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing wherewith you are every day instructed and in this will exercise both your wit and learning for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy tis a desperate thrust wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his and a secret sleight which must be very rarely and then very reservedly put in practice tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another you must not die to be revenged as gobrias did for being closely grappled in combat with a lord of persia darius coming in sword in hand and fearing to strike lest he should kill gobrias he called out to him boldly to fall on

though he should run them both through at once i have known desperate weapons and conditions of single combat and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both censured for unjust the portuguese in the indian sea took certain turks prisoners who impatient of their captivity resolved and it succeeded by striking the nails of the ship one against another and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded to blow up and reduce themselves their masters and the vessel to ashes we here touch the outplate and utmost limits of sciences wherein the extremity is vicious as in virtue keep yourselves in the common road it is not good to be so subtle and cunning remember the tuscan proverb—

i advise you that in all your opinions and discourses as well as in your manners and all other things you keep yourself moderate and temperate and avoid novelty i am an enemy to all extravagant ways you who by the authority of your grandeur and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you but here is as much as you will stand in need of

epicurus said of the laws that the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another and plato affirms that without laws we should live like beasts our wit is a wandering dangerous and temerarious utensil it is hard to couple any order or measure to it in those of our own time who are endued with any rare excellence above others or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners and tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable in study as in all the rest we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art it is curbed and fettered by religions laws customs sciences precepts mortal and immortal penalties and yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize a various and difform body incapable of being either bound or held in earnest there are few souls so regular firm and well descended as are to be trusted with their own conduct and that can with moderation and without temerity sail in the liberty of their own judgments beyond the common and received opinions tis more expedient to put them under pupilage wit is a dangerous weapon even to the possessor if he knows not how to use it discreetly and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given to keep his looks down and before his feet and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him and therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path let it be what it will than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty but if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence at the expense both of your soul and his own to avoid this dangerous plague which is every day laid in your way to infect you this preservative in the extremest necessity will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company

the liberty then and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain but now that men go all one way qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt ut etiam qu non probant cogantur defendere who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree so that the schools have but one pattern and a like circumscribed institution and discipline we no more take notice what the coin weighs and is really worth but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it the alloy is not questioned but how much it is current for in like manner all things pass we take physic as we do geometry and tricks of hocuspocus enchantments and lovespells the correspondence of the souls of the dead prognostications domifications and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers stone all things pass for current pay without any manner of scruple or contradiction we need to know no more but that mars house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand that of venus in the thumb and that of mercury in the little finger that when the tableline cuts the tubercle of the forefinger tis a sign of cruelty that when it falls short of the middle finger and that the natural medianline makes an angle with the vital in the same side tis a sign of a miserable death that if in a woman the natural line be open and does not close the angle with the vital this denotes that she shall not be very chaste i leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies

theophrastus said that human knowledge guided by the senses might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree but that being arrived to first and extreme causes it must stop short and retire by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things tis a moderate and gentle opinion that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things and that it has certain measures of power beyond which tis temerity to employ it this opinion is plausible and introduced by men of well composed minds but tis hard to limit our wit which is curious and greedy and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces having experimentally found that wherein one has failed the other has hit and that what was unknown to one age the age following has explained and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould but are formed and perfected by degrees by often handling and polishing as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form what my force cannot discover i do not yet desist to sound and to try and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again by turning and heating it i lay open to him that shall succeed me a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease and make it more maniable and supple for him

as much will the second do for the third which is the cause that the difficulty ought not to make me despair and my own incapacity as little for tis nothing but my own

man is as capable of all things as of some and if he confesses as theophrastus says the ignorance of first causes let him at once surrender all the rest of his knowledge if he is defective in foundation his reason is aground disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles if this aim do not stop his career he runs into an infinite irresolution non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi

one thing can no more or less be comprehended than another because the definition of comprehending all things is the same now tis very likely that if the soul knew any thing it would in the first place know itself and if it knew any thing out of itself it would be its own body and case before any thing else if we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy

when are we to expect that they will be agreed we are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow or weight to stones if man do not know himself how should he know his force and functions it is not perhaps that we have not some real knowledge in us but tis by chance forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way after the same manner and by the same conduct it has not wherewithal to distinguish them nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood

the academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone thrown by the hand than of that of the eighth sphere and to avoid this difficulty and strangeness that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others and received into their judgment this faculty that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another they allowed him this propension interdicting all resolution the pyrrhonian opinion is more bold and also somewhat more likely for this academic inclination and this propension to one proposition rather than another what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that if our understanding be capable of the form lineaments port and face of truth it might as well see it entire as by halves springing and imperfect this appearance of likelihood which makes them rather take the left hand than the right augments it multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred to a thousand ounces it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy and determine one choice one entire truth but why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude if they know not the truth how should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence either we can absolutely judge or absolutely we cannot if our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation if they only pull and drive tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation what appearance soever they may seem to present us and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate upright and inflexible without tottering or without agitation inter visa vera aut falsa ad animi assensum nihil interest amongst things that seem whether true or false it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind that things do not lodge in us in their form and essence and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority we sufficiently see because if it were so we should receive them after the same manner wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy and are seated in us as we please now if on our part we received any thing without alteration if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means these means being common to all men this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand from one to another and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world amongst so many as there are that would be believed by men with an universal consent but this that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us or that may not be makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves which is a sign that i seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men

let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things for this is truly presupposed that men i mean the most knowing the best bom and of the best parts are not agreed about any one thing not that heaven is over our heads for they that doubt of every thing do also doubt of that and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads and these two opinions are without comparison the stronger in number

besides this infinite diversity and division through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure how variously do we judge of things—how often do we alter our opinions what i hold and believe today i hold and believe with my whole belief all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion and become responsible to me for it at least as much as in them lies i could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than i do this i am wholly and entirely possessed with it but has it not befallen me not only once but a hundred a thousand times every day to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments and in the same condition which i have since judged to be false a man must at least become wise at his own expense if i have often found myself betrayed under this colour if my touch proves commonly false and my balance unequal and unjust what assurance can i now have more than at other times is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide nevertheless let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief as into a vessel other and other opinions yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one for this we must abandon goods honour life health and all

    posterior res ilia reperta
         perdit et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne

         the last things we find out are always best
          and make us to disrelish all the rest
whatever is preached to us and whatever we learn we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives tis a mortal hand that presents it to us tis a mortal hand that accepts it the things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion the sole mark of truth which also we do not see with our own eyes nor receive by our own means that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if god for this end did not prepare it if god did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it at least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes we ought to remember that whatever we receive into the understanding we often receive things that are false and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived

now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences it is certain that our apprehensions our judgment and the faculties of the soul in general suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body which alterations are continual are not our minds more sprightly ou memories more prompt and quick and our thoughts more lively in health than in sickness do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy do you believe that catulluss verses or those of sappho please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous amorous young man cleomenes the son of anexandridas being sick his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed i believe it said he neither am i the same man now as when i am in health being now another person my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before in our courts of justice this word is much in use which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour gentle and mild gaudeat de bon fortun  let him rejoice in his good fortune for it is most certain that mens judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation more sharp and severe and at others more facile easy and inclined to excuse he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout jealousy or theft by his man having his whole soul possessed with anger it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way that venerable senate of the areopagites used to hear and determine by night for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice the very air itself and the serenity of heaven will cause some mutation in us according to these verses in cicero—

              tales sunt hominnm mentes quali pater ipse
         jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras

              mens minds are influencd by th external air
         dark or serene as days are foul or fair
tis not only fevers debauches and great accidents that overthrow our judgments—the least things in the world will do it and we are not to doubt though we may not be sensible of it that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a mans whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs that i believe the physicians that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order

as to what remains this malady does not very easily discover itself unless it be extreme and past remedy forasmuch as reason goes always lame halting and that too as well with falsehood as with truth and therefore tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes i always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason this reason of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject is an instrument of lead and of wax ductile pliable and accommodate to all sorts of biases and to all measures so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it how uprightly soever a judge may mean if he does not look well to himself which few care to do his inclination to friendship to relationship to beauty or revenge and not only things of that weight but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another and that without reasons permission puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects or some shadow of like vanity may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause and make the balance dip

i that watch myself as narrowly as i can and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself like one that has no great business to do elsewhere

              i care not whom the northern clime reveres

dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness i find in myself my foot is so unstable and unsteady i find myself so apt to totter and reel and my sight so disordered that fasting i am quite another man than when full if health and a fair day smile upon me i am a very affable goodnatured man if a corn trouble my toe i am sullen out of humour and not to be seen the same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard and another easy and the same way one while shorter and another longer and the same form one while more another less agreeable i am one while for doing every thing and another for doing nothing at all and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time i have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself either i am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me and by and by i am as merry as a cricket when i take a book in hand i have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages and such as have struck my soul let me light upon them at another time i may turn and toss tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass even in my own writings i do not always find the air of my first fancy i know not what i would have said and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense because i have lost the first that was better i do nothing but go and come my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams—

very often as i am apt to do having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own my mind bending and applying itself that way does so engage me that way that i no more discern the reason of my former belief and forsake it i am as it were misled by the side to which i incline be it what it will and carried away by my own weight every one almost would say the same of himself if he considered himself as i do preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition take ourselves a deeper impression of it and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state you only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer by which you find him indifferent which side he takes have you feed him well that he may relish it the better does he begin to be really concerned and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding he discovers a new light in your business and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so nay i do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger or the interest of reputation may not have made some men even at the stake maintain the opinion for which at liberty and amongst friends they would not have burned a finger the shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the bodys passions can do much in it but its own can do a great deal more to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action like a ship in the middle of the sea to which the winds hare denied their assistance and whoever should maintain this siding with the peripatetics would do us no great wrong seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from and stand in need of this impulse of the passions valour they say cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger semper ajax fortis fortissimus tamen in furore ajax was always brave but most when in a fury neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry nay the advocate it is said is to inspire the judges with indignation to obtain justice

irregular desires moved themistocles and demosthenes and have pushed on the philosophers to watching fasting and pilgrimages and lead us to honour learning and health which are all very useful ends and this meanness of soul in suffering anxiety and trouble serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience and to make us sensible of the scourge of god and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences compassion is a spur to clemency and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear and how many brave actions by ambition how many by presumption in short there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation may not this be one of the reasons that moved the epicureans to discharge god from all care and solicitude of our affairs because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions or have they thought otherwise and taken them for tempests that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur null ne minima quidem aura fluctus commovente sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur quum perturbatis nulla est qua moveri queat as it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it

what varieties of sense and reason what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with what assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace if our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things what security can we expect from it

is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions and nearest approaching the divinity when they are furious mad and beside themselves we better ourselves by the privation of our reason and drilling it the two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods and there to foresee the course of destiny are fury and sleep

this is pleasant to consider by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason we become virtuous by its extirpation occasioned by madness or the image of death we become diviners and prophets i was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy which makes it confess contrary to its own proposition that the most calm composed and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself our wisdom less wise than folly our dreams are worth more than our meditation and the worst place we can take is in ourselves but does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters when dismissed from man so clearsighted so great and so perfect and whilst it is in man so terrestrial ignorant and dark is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark terrestrial and ignorant man and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed

i being of a soft and heavy complexion have no great experience of these vehement agitations the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden without giving it leisure to recollect itself but the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men though it proceed leisurely and with a measured progress does evidently manifest to those who have tried to oppose its power the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion i have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it for i am so far from being one of those that invite vices that i do not so much as follow them if they do not haul me along i perceived it to spring grow and increase in spite of my resistance and at last living and seeing as i was wholly to seize and possess me so that as if rousing from drunkenness the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be i evidently saw the advantages of the object i desired grow and increase and expand by the influence of my imagination and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside but this fire being evaporated in an instant as from a flash of lightning i was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight another state and another judgment the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me which of the two most truly pyrrho knows nothing about it we are never without sickness agues have their hot and cold fits from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering as much as i had advanced so much i retired—

now from the knowledge of this volubility of mine i have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me for what appearance soever there may be in novelty i do not easily change for fear of losing by the bargain and as i am not capable of choosing i take other mens choice and keep myself in the station wherein god has placed me i could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling thus have i by the grace of god preserved myself entire without anxiety or trouble of conscience in the ancient faith of our religion amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced the writings of the ancients the best authors i mean being full and solid tempt and carry me which way almost they will he that i am reading seems always to have the most force and i find that every one in his turn is in the right though they contradict one another the facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony the heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion all the world were of that belief till cleanthes the samian or according to theophrastus nicetas of syracuse took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac and copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences what use can we make of this if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion and who knows but that a third a thousand years hence may over throw the two former

              sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum

               thus evry thing is changed in course of time

         to which some other thing despised before
          succeeds and grows in vogue still more and more

so that when any new doctrine presents itself to us we have great reason to mistrust and to consider that before that was set on foot the contrary had been generally received and that as that has been overthrown by this a third invention in time to come may start up which may damn the second before the principles that aristotle introduced were in reputation other principles contented human reason as these satisfy us now what patent have these people what particular privilege that the career of our invention must be stopped by them and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them they are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were when any one presses me with a new argument i ought to believe that what i cannot answer another can for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar and we are all of the vulgar would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock for their souls being so easy to be imposed upon and without any resistance must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before he that finds himself weak ought to answer according to practice that he will speak with his counsel or refer himself to the wiser from whom he received his instruction how long is it that physic has been practised in the world tis said that a new comer called paracelsus changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules and maintains that till now it has been of no other use but to kill men i believe he will easily make this good but i do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience we are not to believe every one says the precept because every one can say all things a man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds which he would evidently demonstrate to me if i would give him the hearing after i had with some patience heard his arguments which were all full of likelihood of truth what then said i did those that sailed according to theophrastus make way westward when they had the prow towards the east did they go sideward or backward thats fortune answered he but so it is that they were mistaken i replied that i had rather follow effects than reason now these are things that often interfere with one another and i have been told that in geometry which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience as jacques pelletier told me at my own house that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet which nevertheless he affirmed though extended to infinity could never arrive to touch one another and the pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience and tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects for they affirm that we do not move that we do not speak and that there is neither weight nor heat with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things ptolemy who was a great man had established the bounds of this world of ours all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge it had been pyrrhonism a thousand years ago to doubt the science of cosmography and the opinions that every one had received from it it was heresy to admit the antipodes and behold in this age of ours there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered not an island or single country but a division of the world nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before the geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found all is seen—

         nam quod adest prosto placet et pollere videtur

         whats present pleases and appears the best
but it remains to be seen whether as ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say and whether it is not more likely that this great body which we call the world is not quite another thing than what we imagine

plato says that it changes countenance in all respects that the heavens the stars and the sun have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see changing east into west the egyptian priests told herodotus that from the time of their first king which was eleven thousand and odd years since and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life the sun had four times altered his course that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another that the beginning of the world is undetermined aristotle and cicero both say the same and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity is mortal and renewed again by several vicissitudes calling solomon and isaiah to witness to evade those oppositions that god has once been a creator without a creature that he has had nothing to do that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work and that consequently he is subject to change in the most famous of the greek schools the world is taken for a god made by another god greater than he and composed of a body and a soul fixed in his centre and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference divine infinitely happy and infinitely great infinitely wise and eternal in him are other gods the sea the earth the stars who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance sometimes meeting sometimes retiring from one another concealing and discovering themselves changing their order one while before and another behind heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire and by the order of destiny was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire and then to be again renewed and apuleius says of men sigillatim mortales cunctim perpetui that they are mortal in particular and immortal in general alexander writ to his mother the narration of an egyptian priest drawn from their monuments testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite and comprising the birth and progress of other countries cicero and diodorus say that in their time the chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years aristotle pliny and others that zoroaster flourished six thousand years before platos time plato says that they of the city of sais have records in writing of eight thousand years and that the city of athens was built a thousand years before the said city of sais epicurus that at the same time things are here in the posture we see they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds which he would have delivered with greater assurance had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the west indies with ours present and past in so many strange examples

in earnest considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity i have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions and of savage manners and beliefs which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation the human mind is a great worker of miracles but this relation has moreover i know not what of extraordinary in it tis found to be in names also and a thousand other things for they found nations there that for aught we know never heard of us where circumcision was in use where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only without men where our fasts and lent were represented to which was added abstinence from women where our crosses were several ways in repute here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures there they were erected and particularly that of st andrew to protect themselves from nocturnal visions and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments elsewhere there was found one of wood of very great height which was adored for the god of rain and this a great way in the interior there was seen an express image of our penance priests the use of mitres the celibacy of priests the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language and this fancy that the first god was driven away by a second his younger brother that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins their territory changed and their natural condition made worse that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven that but few families escaped who retired into caves on high mountains the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in having shut up together with themselves several sorts of animals that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs which returning clean and wet they judged that the water was not much abated afterwards sending out others and seeing them return dirty they issued out to repeople the world which they found only full of serpents in one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead in rifling the sepultures for riches saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin the traffic by exchange and no other way fairs and markets for that end dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes the use of falconry according to the nature of their hawks tyrannical subsidies nicety in gardens dancing tumbling tricks music of instruments coats of arms tenniscourts dice and lotteries wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty physic no otherwise than by charms the way of writing in cypher the belief of only one first man the father of all nations the adoration of one god who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity fasting and penitence preaching the laws of nature and the ceremonies of religion and that vanished from the world without a natural death the theory of giants the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages and drinking to the utmost religious ornaments painted with bones and dead mens skulls surplices holy water sprinkled wives and servants who present themselves with emulation burnt and interred with the dead husband or master a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate no part being left for the younger but obedience the custom that upon promotion to a certain office of great authority the promoted is to take upon him a new name and to leave that which he had before another to strew lime upon the knee of the newborn child with these words

from dust thou earnest and to dust thou must return as also the art of augury the vain shadows of our religion which are observable in some of these examples are testimonies of its dignity and divinity it is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world by a certain imitation but in these barbarians also as by a common and supernatural inspiration for we find there the belief of purgatory but of a new form that which we give to the fire they give to the cold and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness and this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments and clipped off the prepuce after the mahometan and jewish manner there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air and of this other diversity that whereas we to honour kings and festivals put on the best clothes we have in some regions to express their disparity and submission to their king his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits and entering his palace throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him but to proceed—

if nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs judgments and opinions of men as well as all other things if they have their revolution their season their birth and death like cabbage plants if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them if we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air upon the climate and upon the soil where we are bom and not only the colour the stature the complexion and the countenances but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum sed etiam anirum facit the climate is of great efficacy not only to the strength of bodies but to that of souls also says vegetius and that the goddess who founded the city of athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent as the egyptian priests told solon athenis tenue colum ex quo etiam acutiores putantur attici crassum thebis itaque pingues thebani et valentes the air of athens is subtle and thin whence also the athenians are reputed to be more acute and at thebes more gross and thick wherefore the thebans are looked upon as more heavywitted and more strong in such sort that as fruits and animals grow different men are also more or less warlike just temperate and docile here given to wine elsewhere to theft or uncleanness here inclined to superstition elsewhere to unbelief in one place to liberty in another to servitude capable of one science or of one art dull or ingenious obedient or mutinous good or bad according as the place where they are seated inclines them and assume a new complexion if removed like trees which was the reason why cyrus would not grant the persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even saying that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft if we see one while one art and one belief flourish and another while another through some celestial influence such an age to produce such natures and to incline mankind to such and such a propension the spirits of men one while gay and another gray like our fields what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal seeing that a wise man may be mistaken and a hundred men and a hundred nations nay that even human nature itself as we believe is many ages wide in one thing or another what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken or that in this very age of ours she is not so

methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility this ought not to be forgotten that man cannot by his own wish and desire find out what he wants that not in fruition only but in imagination and wish we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it and satisfy itself—

              quid enim ratione timemus
          aut cupimus quid tain dextro pede concipis ut te
         conatus non poniteat votique peracti

              for what with reason do we speak or shun
         what plan how happily soer begun
         that when achieved we do not wish undone
and therefore it was that socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him and the private and public prayer of the lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the supreme power—

              conjugium petimus partumqu uxoris at illis
         notum qui pueri qualisque futura sit uxor

              we ask for wives and children they above
         know only when we have them what theyll prove
and christians pray to god thy will be done that they may not fall into the inconvenience the poet feigns of king midas he prayed to the gods that all he touched might be turned into gold his prayer was heard his wine was gold his bread was gold the feathers of his bed his shirt his clothes were all gold so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire and endowed with an intolerable benefit and was fain to unpray his prayers

              attonitus novitate mali divesque miserque

              astonished at the strangeness of the ill

         he wishes now he could his wealth evade
         and hates the thing for which before he prayed
to instance in myself being young i desired of fortune above all things the order of st michael which was then the utmost distinction of honour amongst the french nobles and very rare she pleasantly gratified my longing instead of raising me and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it she was much kinder to me for she brought it so low and made it so cheap that it stooped down to my shoulders and lower cleobis and bito trophonius and agamedes having requested the first of their goddess the last of their god a recompense worthy of their piety had death for a reward so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us god might grant us riches honours life and even health to our own hurt for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us if he sends us death or an increase of sickness instead of a cure vvrga tua et baculus tuus ipsa me consolata sunt thy rod and thy staff have comforted me he does it by the rule of his providence which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do and we ought to take it in good part as coming from a wise and most friendly hand

there is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers as about the question of the sovereign good of man whence by the calculation of varro rose two hundred and eightyeight sects qui autem de summo bono dissentit de tot philosophies ratione disputt for whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme good disputes upon the whole matter of philosophy

              trs mihi conviv prope dissentire videntur

nature should say the same to their contests and debates some say that our wellbeing lies in virtue others in pleasure others in submitting to nature one in knowledge another in being exempt from pain another in not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances and this fancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient pythagoras

              nil admirari prope res est una numici
         solaque qu possit facere et servare beatum

              not to admires the only art i know
         can make us happy and can keep us so
which is the drift of the pyrrhonian sect aristotle attributes the admiring nothing to magnanimity and arcesilaus said that constancy and a right inflexible state of judgment were the true good and consent and application the sin and evil and there it is true in being thus positive and establishing a certain axiom he quitted pyrrhonism for the pyrrhonians when they say that ataraxy which is the immobility of judgment is the sovereign good do not design to speak it affirmatively but that the same motion of soul which makes them avoid precipices and take shelter from the cold presents them such a fancy and makes them refuse another

how much do i wish that whilst i live either some other or justus lipsius the most learned man now living of a most polite and judicious understanding truly resembling my turnebus had both the will and health and leisure sufficient carefully and conscientiously to collect into a register according to their divisions and classes as many as are to be found of the opinions of the ancient philosophers about the subject of our being and manners their controversies the succession and reputation of sects with the application of the lives of the authors and their disciples to their own precepts in memorable accidents and upon exemplary occasions what a beautiful and useful work that would be

as to what remains if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the rules of our manners upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves for that which our reason advises us to as the most likely is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country as was the advice of socrates inspired as he says by a divine counsel and by that what would it say but that our duty has no other rule but what is accidental truth ought to have a like and universal visage if man could know equity and justice that had a body and a true being he would not fetter it to the conditions of this country or that it would not be from the whimsies of the persians or indians that virtue would receive its form there is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the laws since i was born i have known those of the english our neighbours three or four times changed not only in matters of civil regimen which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed with but in the most important subject that can be namely religion at which i am the more troubled and ashamed because it is a nation with whom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and acquaintance that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our ancient kindred and here with us at home i have known a thing that was capital to become lawful and we that hold of others are likewise according to the chance of war in a possibility of being one day found guilty of hightreason both divine and human should the justice of our arms fall into the power of injustice and after a few years possession take a quite contrary being how could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine being and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of their own contrivance useful as a bond to their society than declaring as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction that every ones true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he chanced to be o god what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign creator for having disabused our belief from these wandering and arbitrary devotions and for having seated it upon the eternal foundation of his holy word but what then will philosophers say to us in this necessity that we follow the laws of our country that is to say this floating sea of the opinions of a republic or a prince that will paint out justice for me in as many colours and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves i cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible what kind of virtue is that which i see one day in repute and that tomorrow shall be in none and which the crossing of a river makes a crime what sort of truth can that be which these mountains limit to us and make a lie to all the world beyond them

but they are pleasant when to give some certainty to the laws they say that there are some firm perpetual and immovable which they call natural that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being and of these some reckon three some four some more some less a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest now they are so unfortunate for what can i call it else but misfortune that of so infinite a number of laws there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations they are i say so miserable that of these three or four select laws there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned not only by one nation but by many now the only likely sign by which they can argue or infer some natural laws is the universality of approbation for we should without doubt follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us and not only every nation but every private man would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law but let them produce me one of this condition proctagoras and aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator and that these laid aside the honest and the good lost their qualities and remained empty names of indifferent things thrasymachus in plato is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior there is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem as in lacedemon dexterity in stealing marriages between near relations are capitally interdicted amongst us they are elsewhere in honour—

              gentes esse ferantur
         in quibus et nato genitrix et nata parenti
         jungitur et pietas geminato crescit amore

              there are some nations in the world tis said
         where fathers daughters sons their mothers wed
         and their affections thereby higher rise
         more firm and constant by these double ties
the murder of infants the murder of fathers the community of wives traffic of robberies license in all sorts of voluptuousness in short there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other

it is credible that there are natural laws for us as we see them in other creatures but they are lost in us this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command as to shuffle and confound the face of things according to its own vanity and inconstancy nihil itaque amplius nostrum est quod nostrum dico artis est therefore nothing is any more truly ours what we call ours belongs to art subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds one nation considers a subject in one aspect and stops there another takes it in a different point of view

there is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father and yet the people whose ancient custom it was so to do looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture storing up in themselves and as it were in their own marrow the bodies and relics of their fathers and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh by means of nourishment and digestion it is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers remains to the corruption of the earth and the nourishment of beasts and worms

lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity diligence boldness and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own and believed that from this double institution of assaulting and defending advantage was to be made for military discipline which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another mans goods

dionysius the tyrant offered plato a robe of the persian fashion long damasked and perfumed plato refused it saying that being born a man he would not willingly dress himself in womens clothes but aristippus accepted it with this answer that no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage his friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit for laying it no more to heart that dionysius had spit in his face fishermen said he suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon diogenes was washing cabbages and seeing him pass by if thou couldst live on cabbage said he thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant to whom aristippus replied and if thou knewest how to live amongst men thou wouldst not be washing cabbages thus reason finds appearances for divers effects tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left—

              bellum o terra hospita portas
         bello armantur eqni bellum hc armenta minantur
         sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti

         spes est pacis

         war war is threatened from this foreign ground
               my father cried where warlike steeds are found
         yet since reclaimed to chariots they submit
         and bend to stubborn yokes and champ the bit
         peace may succeed to war
solon being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and unprofitable tears for the death of his son it is for that reason that i the more justly shed them said he because they are powerless and unprofitable socratess wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance oh how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death why replied he hadst thou rather they should execute me justly we have our ears bored the greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery we retire in private to enjoy our wives the indians do it in public the scythians immolated strangers in their temples elsewhere temples were a refuge—

               inde furor vulgi quod numina vicinorum
         odit quisque locus cum solos credat habendos
         esse deos quos ipse colit

              thus tis the popular fury that creates
         that all their neighbours gods each nation hates
         each thinks its own the genuine in a word
         the only deities to be adored
i have heard of a judge who coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt bartolus and aldus and some point controverted with many contrarieties writ in the margin of his book a question for a friend that is to say that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit twas only for want of wit that he did not write a question for a friend throughout the advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit in so infinite a science depending upon the authority of so many opinions and so arbitrary a subject it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary and itself contrary to that at another time of which we see very frequent examples owing to that practice admitted amongst us and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice of not abiding by one sentence but running from judge to judge and court to court to decide one and the same cause

as to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue tis not necessary to be insisted upon therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds arcesilaus said that in venery it was no matter where or with whom it was committed et obsccenas voluptates si natura requirit non genere aut loco aut ordine sed forma otate jigur metiendas epicurus putat ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur queeramus ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint and obscene pleasures if nature requires them epicurus thinks are not to be measured either by race kind place or rank but by age shape and beauty neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved these last two stoical quotations and the reproach that dicarchus threw into the teeth of plato himself upon this account show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom

laws derive their authority from possession and custom tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning they grow great and ennoble themselves like our rivers by running on but follow them upward to their source tis but a little spring scarce discernable

that swells thus and thus fortifies itself by growing old do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent so full of dignity awe and reverence you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people who weigh and reduce every thing to reason and who admit nothing by authority or upon trust have their judgments often very remote and differing from those of the public it is no wonder if people who take their pattern from the first image of nature should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path as for example few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages and most of them have been for having wives in common and without obligation they would refuse our ceremonies chrysippus said that a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults aye and without his breeches for a dozen of olives
that philosopher would hardly have advised clisthenes to have refused hippoclides the fair agarista his daughter for having seen him stand on his head upon a table metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation in the presence of a great auditory in his school and kept himself hid in his own house for shame till crates coming to visit him and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty by falling to try with him who should sound most cured him of that scruple and withal drew him to his own stoical sect more free than that more reserved one of the peripatetics of which he had been till then that which we call decency not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private the stoics call foppery and to mince it and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature custom and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions they reputed a vice the other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of venus to draw them out of the private oratory to expose them to the view of the people and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them modesty is a thing of weight secrecy reservation and circumspection are parts of esteem pleasure did very ingeniously when under the mask of virtue she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets trodden under foot and exposed to the public view wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places that was confined to one but moreover by the difficulty to incite wild and idle people to this vice—

              mochus es aufidi qui vir
         scvine fuisti
         rivalis fuerat qui tuus ille vir est
          cur alina placet tibi qu tua non placet uxor
         numquid securus non potes arrigere
this experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples—

              nullus in urbe fuit tot qui tangere vellet
         uxorem gratis cciliane tuam
         dum licuit sed nunc positis custodibus ingens
         turba fututorum est ingeniosus homo es
a philosopher being taken in the very act and asked what he was doing coldly replied i am planting man no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic

it is i suppose out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the cynics but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only to maintain the impudence of their schools profession and that to eject what shame had withheld and restrained it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade but he had not thoroughly examined their debauches for diogenes playing the beast with himself in public wished in the presence of all that saw him that he could fill his belly by that exercise to those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street he made answer because i am hungry in the open street the women philosophers who mixed with their sect mixed also with their persons in all places without reservation and hipparchia was not received into cratess society but upon condition that she should in all things follow the practice and customs of his rule these philosophers set a great price upon virtue and renounce all other discipline but the moral and yet in all their actions they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage and above the laws and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only and the conservation of the liberty of others

heraclitus and protagoras forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick and pleasant to the sound the rudder crooked in the water and straight when out and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects argued thence that all subjects had in themselves the causes of these appearances and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick mans taste and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water and so of all the rest which is to say that all is in all things and consequently nothing in any one for where all is there is nothing

this opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing whether bitter or sweet straight or crooked that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over into the cleanest purest and most perfect words that can possibly be how many lies and falsities have we suggested what heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words a person of dignity who would approve to me by authority the search of the philosophers stone wherein he was head over ears engaged lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the bible upon which he said he first founded his attempt for the discharge of his conscience for he is a divine and in truth the idea was not only pleasant but moreover very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science

by this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired there is no fortuneteller if we have this authority but if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words he may make him like the sibyls say what he will there are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that either obliquely or in a direct line an ingenious wit will find out in every subject some air that will serve for his purpose therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use let the author but make himself master of that to busy posterity about his predictions which not only his own parts but the accidental favour of the matter itself may do for him and as to the rest express himself whether after a foolish or a subtle manner somewhat obscurely or contradictorily tis no matter—a number of wits shaking and sifting him will bring out a great many several forms either according to his meaning or collateral or contrary to it which will all redound to his honour he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents this it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all that has brought several writings in vogue and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations nay as many as we please

is it possible that homer could design to say all that we make him say and that he designed so many and so various figures as that the divines lawgivers captains philosophers and all sorts of men who treat of sciences how variously and opposite soever should indifferently quote him and support their arguments by his authority as the sovereign lord and master of all offices works and artisans and counsellorgeneral of all enterprises whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person and a particular friend of mine has there found out in favour of our religion and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was homers design and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time and what he has found in favour of our religion there very many anciently have found in favour of theirs do but observe how plato is tumbled and tossed about every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself and making him take what side they please they draw him in and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives and make him according to the different course of things differ from himself every one makes him disavow according to his own sense the manners and customs lawful in his age because they are unlawful in ours and all this with vivacity and power according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter from the same foundation that heraclitus and this sentence of his had that all things had in them those forms that we discern democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion—that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter the pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter or whether the one or the other or both for these always gained the highest point of dubitation the cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us as pain and pleasure acknowledging neither sound nor colour but certain affections only that we receive from them and that mans judgment had no other seat protagoras believed that what seems true to every one is true to every one the epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses and in the knowledge of things and in pleasure plato would have the judgment of truth and truth itself derived from opinions and the senses to belong to the wit and cogitation

this discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses in which lies the greatest foundation and prof of our ignorance whatsoever is known is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower for seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will not by the constraint of another as it would happen if we knew things by the power and according to the law of their essence now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses they are our masters—

                via qua munita fidei
          proxima fert humanum in pectus templaque mentis

              it is the surest path that faith can find
         by which to enter human heart and mind
science begins by them and is resolved into them after all we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound odour light taste measure weight softness hardness sharpness colour smoothness breadth and depth these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge and according to some science is nothing else but sense he that could make me contradict the senses would have me by the throat he could not make me go further back the senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge—

               invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam
          notitiam veil neque sensus posse refelli
           quid majore fide porro quam sensus haberi debet

              of truth whateer discoveries are made
          are by the senses to us first conveyed
         nor will one sense be baffled for on what
         can we rely more safely than on that
let us attribute to them the least we can we must however of necessity grant them this that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed cicero says that chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein whereupon cameades who maintained the contrary side boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of chrysippus to controvert and confute him and therefore thus cried out against him o miserable thy force has destroyed thee there can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm that light does not shine and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron which are things conveyed to us by the senses neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty

the first consideration i have upon the subject of the senses is that i make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses i see several animals who live an entire and perfect life some without sight others without hearing who knows whether to us also one two three or many other senses may not be wanting for if any one be wanting our examination cannot discover the defect tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration not so much as one sense in the discovery of another—

                 an poterunt oculos aures reprehendere an aures
            tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris
          an confutabunt nares oculive revincent

                can ears the eyes the touch the ears correct
           or is that touch by tasting to be checkd
          or th other senses shall the nose or eyes
           confute in their peculiar faculties
they all make the extremest limits of our ability—

               seorsum cuique potestas divisa est sua vis cuique est

              each has its power distinctly and alone
         and every senses power is its own
it is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see impossible to make him desire sight or to regret his defect for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the souls being contented and satisfied with those we have considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection if there be any such thing it is impossible to say any thing to this blind man either by reasoning argument or similitude that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light colour or sight theres nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence those that are born blind whom we hear wish they could see it is not that they understand what they desire they have learned from us that they want something that there is something to be desired that we have which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences but yet they know not what it is nor apprehend it at all

i have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own they brought him a child to which he was godfather which having taken into his arms good god said he what a fine child how beautiful to look upon what a pretty face it has he will say like one of us this room has a very fine prospect—it is clear weather—the sun shines bright and moreover being that hunting tennis and butts are our exercises and he has heard so he has taken a liking to them will ride ahunting and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear one cries out to him heres a hare when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride and afterwards when they tell him the hare is killed he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are he will take a tennisball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket he will shoot with a harquebuss at random and is contented with what his people tell him that he is over or wide

who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity for want of some sense and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us what do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence and that several effects of animals which exceed our capacity are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours we seize an apple with all our senses we there find redness smoothness odour and sweetness but it may have other virtues besides these as to heat or binding which no sense of ours can have any reference unto is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things as for the loadstone to attract iron and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight and when it grows to be towards day and that makes them crow accordingly that teaches chickens before they have any experience of the matter to fear a sparrowhawk and not a goose or a peacock though birds of a much larger size that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them and makes them not to fear a dog to arm themselves against the mewing a kind of flattering voice of the one and not against the barking a shrill and threatening voice of the other that teaches wasps ants and rats to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them and inspires the stag elephant and serpent with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure there is no sense that has not a mighty dominion and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges if we were defective in the intelligence of sounds of harmony and of the voice it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science for besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense how many arguments consequences and conclusions do we draw to other things by comparing one sense with another let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him what a darkness and blindness in the soul he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense or of two or three should we be so deprived would be we have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence

the sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us if they fail in their report if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage we have nothing else to hold by from this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed that every subject has in itself all we there find that it has nothing in it of what we think we there find and that of the epicureans that the sun is no bigger than tis judged by our sight to be—

                quidquid id est nihilo fertur majore figura
         quam nostris oculis quam cemimus esse videtur

              but be it what it will in our esteems
         it is no bigger than to us it seems
that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near and less to him that is more remote are both true—

              nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum
         proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli

              yet that the eyes deluded we deny
         charge not the minds faults therefore on the eye
and resolutely that there is no deceit in the senses that we are to lie at their mercy and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find even to the inventing of lies and other flams if it come to that rather than accuse the senses timagoras vowed that by pressing or turning his eye he could never perceive the light of the candle to double and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion and not from the instrument the most absurd of all absurdities with the epicureans is to deny the force and effect of the senses—

                  proinde quod in quoquo est his visum tempore verum est
            et si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam
            cur ea qu fuerint juxtim quadrata procul sint
            visa rotunda tamen prstat rationis egentem
            beddere mendose causas utriusque figur
           quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam
            et violare fidem primam et convellere tota
            fundamenta quibus nixatur vita salusque
            non modo enim ratio ruat omnis vita quoque ipsa
           concidat extemplo nisi credere sensibus ausis
            procipitesque locos vitare et ctera qu sint
           in genere hoc fugienda

                that what we see exists i will maintain
          and if our feeble reason cant explain
            why things seem square when they are very near
            and at a greater distance round appear
           tis better yet for him thats at a pause
          t assign to either figure a false cause
          than shock his faith and the foundations rend
         on which our safety and our life depend
         for reason not alone but life and all
         together will with sudden ruin fall
         unless we trust our senses nor despise
         to shun the various dangers that arise
this so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable foolish and mad but that it is yet better that man to set a greater value upon himself make use of any other remedy how fantastic soever than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him he cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge but they are uncertain and falsifiable in all circumstances tis there that he is to fight it out to the last and if his just forces fail him as they do to supply that defect with obstinacy temerity and impudence in case what the epicureans say be true viz that we have no knowledge if the senses appearances be false and if that also be true which the stoics say that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge we shall conclude to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects that there is no science at all

as to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us in the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us which comes from a place behind—

              exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes
         classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus idem
         apparent et longe divolsi licet ingens
         insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur
         et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur
         qnos agimns proter navim velisque volamus
         ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit
         flamine equi corpus transversum ferre videtur
         vis et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim

               and rocks i th seas that proudly raise their head
         though far disjoined though royal navies spread
         their sails between yet if from distance shown
         they seem an island all combind in one
         thus ships though driven by a prosperous gale
         seem fixd to sailors those seem under sail
         that ride at anchor safe and all admire
         as they row by to see the rocks retire
         thus when in rapid streams my horse hath stood
         and i lookd downward on the rolling flood
         though he stood still i thought he did divide
         the headlong streams and strive against the tide
         and all things seemd to move on every side
take a musketball under the forefinger the middle finger being lapped over it it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time for that the senses are very often masters of our reason and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false is frequently seen i set aside the sense of feeling that has its functions nearer more lively and substantial that so often by the effects of the pains it helps the body to subverts and overthrows all those fine stoical resolutions and compels him to cry out of his belly who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—that the colic and all other pains and diseases are indifferent things not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue there is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches the variety of ornaments and order of our ceremonies and in hearing the solemn music of our organs and the grace and devout harmony of our voices even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions for my part i do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of horace or catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion and zeno had reason to say that the voice was the flower of beauty one would once make me believe that a certain person whom all we frenchmen know had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice and therefore philoxenus was not so much to blame hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his saying i break what is thine because thou corruptest what is mine to what end did those men who have with a firm resolution destroyed themselves turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed and that those who for their health desire and command incisions to be made and cauteries to be applied to them cannot endure the sight of the preparations instruments and operations of the surgeon being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey that this rouge came from spain and this pearlpowder from the ocean sea our sight will nevertheless compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason for in this there is nothing of its own—

               auferinrar cultu gemmis auroque teguntur
         crimina pars minima est ipsa puella sni
         spe ubi sit quod ames inter tarn multa requiras
         decipit hac oculos gide dives amor

               by dress were won gold gems and rich brocades
          make up the pageant that your heart invades
          in all that glittering figure which you see
         the far least part of her own self is she
         in vain for her you love amidst such cost
         you search the mistress in such dress is lost
what a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses that make narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow

              cunctaque miratur quibus est mirabilis ipse
         se cupit imprudens et qui probat ipse probatur
         dumque petit petitur pariterque accendit et ardet

         and inconsiderately himself desird

         who seeks is sought th inflamer is inflamd
and pygmalions judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman

              oscnla dat reddique putat sequi turque tenetque
         et credit tactis digitos insidere membris
         et metuit pressos veniat ne livor in artus

              he kisses and believes hes kissed again
         seizes and twixt his arms his love doth strain
         and thinks the polishd ivory thus held

         and has a timorous fear lest black and blue

put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron hang him on the top of the high tower of notre dame at paris he will see by manifest reason that he cannot possibly fall and yet he will find unless he has been used to the plumbers trade that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples if they are made with open work although they are of stone and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers of breadth sufficient to walk upon there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground i have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts and though i am one who am not the most subject to be afraid i was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling though i stood above my length from the edge of the precipice and could not have fallen unless i would where i also observed that what height soever the precipice was provided there were some tree or some jutting out of a rock a little to support and divide the sight it a little eases our fears and gives greater assurance as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit to that one cannot look without dizziness which is a manifest imposture of the sight and therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes to free the soul from being diverted by them and that he might philosophize at greater liberty but by the same rule he should have dammed up his ears that theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us and finally should have deprived himself of all his other senses that is to say of his life and being for they have all the power to command our soul and reason fit etiam sope specie qudam sope vocum gravitate et cantibus ut pettantur animi vehementius sope etiam cura et timor for it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight by the quality and sound of the voice or by singing and ofttimes also by grief and fear physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury i have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron as also to hear chewing near them or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose will move some people even to anger and hatred of what use was that piping prompter of gracchus who softened raised and moved his masters voice whilst he declaimed at rome if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory in earnest there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind

the same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them the soul also some times has its revenge they lie and contend which should most deceive one another what we see and hear when we are transported with passion we neither see nor hear as it is—

               et solem geminum et duplices se ostendere thebas

              thebes seems two cities and the sun two suns
the object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is

              multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus
         esse in deliciis summoque in honore vigere

              hence tis that ugly things in fancied dress
         seem gay look fair to lovers eyes and please
and that we hate more ugly to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast our senses are not only depraved but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul how many things do we see that we do not take notice of if the mind be occupied with other thoughts

               in rebus quoque apertis noscere possis
         si non advertas animum proinde esse quasi omni
         tempore semot fuerint longeque remot

               nay even in plainest things unless the mind
         take heed unless she sets herself to find
         the thing no more is seen no more belovd
         than if the most obscure and most removd
it would appear that the soul retires within and amuses the powers of the senses and so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood

they who have compared our lives to a dream were perhaps more in the right than they were aware of when we dream the soul lives works and exercises all its faculties neither more nor less than when awake but more largely and obscurely yet not so much neither that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun but as betwixt night and shade there she sleeps here she slumbers but whether more or less tis still dark and cimmerian darkness we wake sleeping and sleep waking i do not see so clearly in my sleep but as to my being awake i never found it clear enough and free from clouds moreover sleep when it is profound sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies which are waking dreams and worse than dreams our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought our action is not another sort of dreaming and our waking a certain kind of sleep

if the senses be our first judges it is not ours that we are alone to consult for in this faculty beasts have as great or greater than we it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man others that of seeing others that of feeling others that of touch and taste democritus said that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man but betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds it kills the serpent—

              tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est
          ut quod aliis cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum
         spe etenim serpens hominis contacta saliv
         disperit ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa

               and in those things the difference is so great
         that whats ones poison is anothers meat
         for serpents often have been seen tis said
         when touchd with human spittle to go mad
         and bite themselves to death
what quality shall we attribute to our spittle as it affects ourselves or as it affects the serpent by which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for

pliny says there are certain seahares in the indies that are poison to us and we to them insomuch that with the least touch we kill them which shall be truly poison the man or the fish which shall we believe the fish of the man or the man of the fish one quality of the air infects a man that does the ox no harm some other infects the ox but hurts not the man which of the two shall in truth and nature be the pestilent quality to them who have the jaundice all things seem yellow and paler than to us—

              lurida prterea fiunt qucunque tuentur arquati

               besides whatever jaundicd eyes do view
         looks pale as well as those and yellow too
they who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody what do we know but that these humours which thus alter the operations of sight predominate in beasts and are usual with them for we see some whose eyes are yellow like us who have the jaundice and others of a bloody colour tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us which of the two shall make a right judgment for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only hardness whiteness depth and sharpness have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us and nature has equally designed them for their use when we press down the eye the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down this length therefore is perhaps the true form of that body and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state if we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us—

               bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis
         et duplices hominum facis et corpora bina

              one lamp seems double and the men appear
         each on two bodies double heads to bear
if our ears be hindered or the passage stopped with any thing we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do animals likewise who have either the ears hairy or but a very little hole instead of an ear do not consequently hear as we do but receive another kind of sound we see at festivals and theatres that opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux all things in the place appear to us green yellow or violet—

              et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela
         et ferrugina cum magnis intenta theatris
         per malos vulgata trabesque trementia pendent
         namque ibi consessum caveai subter et omnem
         scenai speciem patrum matrumque deorumque
         inficiunt coguntque suo volitare colore

              thus when pale curtains or the deeper red
         oer all the spacious theatre are spread
         which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear
         and the loose curtains wanton in the air
         whole streams of colours from the summit flow
         the rays divide them in their passage through
         and stain the scenes and men and gods below
tis likely that the eyes of animals which we see to be of divers colours produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes

we should therefore to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses be first agreed with beasts and secondly amongst ourselves which we by no means are but enter into dispute every time that one hears sees or tastes something otherwise than another does and contests as much as upon any other thing about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us a child by the ordinary rule of nature hears sees and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old and he than one of threescore the senses are in some more obscure and dusky and more open and quick in others we receive things variously according as we are and according as they appear to us those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers which are called endless feathers no eye can discern their size or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge and on the other contract and come so a point even when the ring is being turned round the finger yet when you feel them they seem all of an equal size now our perception being so uncertain and so controverted it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify and this foundation being shaken all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin what do our senses themselves hinder one another a picture seems raised and embossed to the sight in the handling it seems flat to the touch shall we say that musk which delights the smell and is offensive to the taste is agreeable or no there are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body that are hurtful to another honey is pleasant to the taste but offensive to the sight they who to assist their lust used in ancient times to make use of magnifyingglasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more to which of their senses did they give the prize—whether to the sight that represented the members as large and great as they would desire or to the feeling which represented them little and contemptible are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions and have the subjects themselves nevertheless but one as we see in the bread we eat it is nothing but bread but by being eaten it becomes bones blood flesh hair and nails—

                ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes
        disperit atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se

                as meats diffusd through all the members lose
        their former state and different things compose
the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk leaf and fruit and the air being but one is modulated in a trumpet to a thousand sorts of sounds are they our senses i would fain know that in like manner form these subjects into so many divers qualities or have they them really such in themselves and upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence moreover since the accidents of disease of raving or sleep make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful the wise and those that are awake is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding and our natural humours have also wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition and accommodate them to themselves as well as when they are disordered—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it as well as the intemperate and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other he whose mouth is out of taste says the wine is flat the healthful man commends its flavour and the thirsty its briskness now our condition always accommodating things to itself and transforming them according to its own posture we cannot know what things truly are in themselves seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses where the compass the square and the rule are crooked all propositions drawn thence and all buildings erected by those guides must of necessity be also defective the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce—

                 denique ut in fabric si prava est rgula prima
         normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit
         et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum
        omnia mendose fieri atque obstipa necessum est
        prava cubantia prona supina atque absona tecta
        jam ruere ut qudam videantuxvelle ruantque
        prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis
        sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est
        falsaque sit falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est

                but lastly as in building if the line
        be not exact and straight the rule decline
        or level false how vain is the design
        uneven an illshapd and tottering wall
        must rise this part must sink that part must fall
        because the rules were false that fashiond all
        thus reasons rules are false if all commence
        and rise from failing and from erring sense
as to what remains who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences as we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other free from all choice and affection which cannot be amongst christians just so it falls out in this for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age being himself a party in the case if young there is the same exception if healthful sick asleep or awake he is still the same incompetent judge we must have some one exempt from all these propositions as of things indifferent to him and by this rule we must have a judge that never was

to judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects we ought t have a deciding instrument to verify this instrument we must have demonstration to verify this demonstration an instrument and here we are round again upon the wheel and no further advanced seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute being full of uncertainty themselves it must then be reason that must do it but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason and so we run back to all infinity our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange but is conceived by the mediation of the senses and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject but only their own passions by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject but only of the passion and sufferance of sense which passion and subject are different things wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject and to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects as they who never knew socrates cannot when they see his picture say it is like him now whoever would notwithstanding judge by appearances if it be by all it is impossible because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies as we by experience see shall some select appearances govern the rest you must verify this select by another select the second by a third and thus there will never be any end to it finally there is no constant existence neither of the objects being nor our own both we and our judgments and all mortal things are evermore incessantly running and rolling and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation

we have no communication with being by reason that all human nature is always in the middle betwixt being bom and dying giving but an obscure appearance and shadow a weak and uncertain opinion of itself and if perhaps you fix your thought to apprehend your being it would be but like grasping water for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold so seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another reason that there looks for a real substance finds itself deceived not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent because that every thing is either entering into being and is not yet arrived at it or begins to die before it is bom plato said that bodies had never any existence but only birth conceiving that homer had made the ocean and thetis father and mother of the gods to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation motion and variation the opinion of all the philosophers as he says before his time parmenides only excepted who would not allow things to have motion on the power whereof he sets a mighty value pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable the stoics that there is no time present and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past heraclitus that never any man entered twice into the same river epicharmus that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now and that he who was invited overnight to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited considering that they are no more the same men but are become others and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition for by the suddenness and quickness of the change it one while disperses and another reunites it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays as being at an end but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another as human seed is first in the mothers womb made a formless embryo after delivered thence a sucking infant afterwards it becomes a boy then a youth then a man and at last a decrepit old man so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before—

             mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas
        ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet
        nec manet ulla sui similis res omnia migrant
        omnia commutt natura et vertere cogit

            for time the nature of the world translates
        and from preceding gives all things new states
        nought like itself remains but all do range
        and nature forces every thing to change
and yet we foolishly fear one kind of death whereas we have already passed and do daily pass so many others for not only as heraclitus said the death of fire is generation of air and the death of air generation of water but moreover we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves manhood dies and passes away when age comes on and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a fullgrown man infancy in youth and the first age dies in infancy yesterday died in today and today will die in tomorrow and there is nothing that remains in the same state or that is always the same thing and that it is so let this be the proof if we are always one and the same how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing and by and by with another how comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things that we praise or condemn them how comes it to pass that we have different affections and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought for it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions and that which suffers mutation does not remain the same and if it be not the same it is not at all but the same that the being is does like it unknowingly change and alter becoming evermore another from another thing and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves taking that which seems for that which is for want of well knowing what that which is is but what is it then that truly is that which is eternal that is to say that never had beginning nor never shall have ending and to which time can bring no mutation for time is a mobile thine and that appears as in a shadow with a matter evermore flowing and running without ever remaining stable and permanent and to which belong those words before and after has been or shall be which at the first sight evidently show that it is not a thing that is for it were a great folly and a manifest falsity to say that that is which is not et being or that has already ceased to be and as to these words present instant and now by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time reason discovering does presently destroy it for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past being of necessity to consider it divided in two the same happens to nature that is measured as to time that measures it for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other but all things are either born bearing or dying so that it were sinful to say of god who is he only who is that he was or that he shall be  for those are terms of declension transmutation and vicissitude of what cannot continue or remain in being wherefore we are to conclude that god alone is not according to any measure of time but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity not measured by time nor subject to any declension before whom nothing was and after whom nothing shall be either more new or more recent but a real being that with one sole now fills the for ever and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone without our being able to say he has been or shall be without beginning and without end to this so religious conclusion of a pagan i shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition for the close of this long and tedious discourse which would furnish me with endless matter what a vile and abject thing says he is man if he do not raise himself above humanity tis a good word and a profitable desire but withal absurd for to make the handle bigger than the hand the cubic longer than the arm and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach is both impossible and monstrous or that man should rise above himself and humanity for he cannot see but with his eyes nor seize but with his hold he shall be exalted if god will lend him an extraordinary hand he shall exalt himself by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial it belongs to our christian faith and not to the stoical virtue to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis1embed"
