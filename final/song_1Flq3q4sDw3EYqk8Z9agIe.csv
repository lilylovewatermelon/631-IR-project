i was walking down a one way street
just a looking for someone to meet
one woman who was looking for a man

and im wondering wondering if youll stay for the night
so im coming i dont want to be lonely baby please tell me

now the feeling is beginning to grow
and the meaning is something you only know
if you believe it take my hand and ill take your heart

i want to love you all over

chorus
do you believe in love
