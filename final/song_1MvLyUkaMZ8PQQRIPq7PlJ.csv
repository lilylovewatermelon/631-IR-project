good love will last until you die

when i woke up this morning
autumn leaves just pass me by
saw this couple just crying
and in my mind i wonder why
i could tell it was special
cause something felt so true yeah
thats the thing about true love
that is the way i wanna be happy with you

good love will make you cry
good love will last until you die

now im speaking as a woman
raised with a mothers love
she said you better recognize
the truth from lies
its in the eyes
gotta look beyond what you see
its so much deeper that visually
lets come together just you and me
look and see through the trees
the journey of
you might also likegood love will make you cry
good love will last until you die

love can make you warm
or it can make you very cold
if you listen to your heart
the truth will unfold
when you find that honey honey
that touches you on sight
you should never fight that feeling
cause good loves so right

good love will make you cry
good love will last until you dieembed"
