yo i had to reinvent i put the v in vent
i put the heat in vents man i been competin since
i look beyond what people sayin and i see intent
then i just sit back and decipher what they really meant
cherish these nights cherish these people
life is a movie but therell never be a sequel
and im good with that as long as im peaceful
as long as seven years from now im takin my daughter to preschool
cherish these days man do they go quick
just yesterday i swear it was 06
ten years ago thats when you proposed
i looked down yes i suppose

prechorus
all things go all things go
all things go all things go

chorus
i feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
while we keep waitin for a moment to live for
so cant nobody ever tell me that im wrong
cause ima ride out wit you still the night is young
and we keep goin we go we go we go
we wake back up and do it all again and we know we know
said fuck the world we ridin til the end
when all is said and done look what weve become oh we go
i just want you to know that i did it for you

i lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
his sister said he wanted to stay with me but i didnt invite him
why didnt he ask or am i just buggin
cause since i got fame they dont act the same
even though they know that i love em
family ties broken before me
niggas tryna kill him he aint even call me
and thats the reflection of me
yes i get it i get it was all me
ill pop a pill and remember
the look in his eyes the last day he saw me

prechorus
all things go all things go
all things go all things go

chorus
i feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
while we keep waitin for a moment to live for
so cant nobody ever tell me that im wrong
cause ima ride out wit you still the night is young
and we keep goin we go we go we go
we wake back up and do it all again and we know we know
said fuck the world we ridin til the end
when all is said and done look what weve become oh we go
i just want you to know that i did it for you
verse 3
lemme make this clear im not difficult im just bout my business
im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
even the ones that hurt me the most i still show forgiveness
i love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact
id give it all if somehow i could just rekindle that
she never understands why im so overprotective
the more i work the more i feel like somehow theyre neglected
i want caiah to go to college just to say we did it
my child with aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
so in some ways i feel like caiah is the both of them
its like hes caiahs little angel lookin over him
and i know jelani will always love me and ill always love him
and im just his little sister not nicki minaj when im around him
gee we did it lets leave this imprint
just finished writin this is the pinkprint

outro
all things go all things go
