burr
since when are you a democraticrepublican
burr
since being one put me on the up and up again

hamilton
no one knows who you are or what you do

burr
they don’t need to know me
they don’t like you

hamilton
excuse me

burr
oh wall street thinks you’re great
you’ll always be adored by the things you create
but upstate—

hamilton
wait
burr
—people think you’re crooked
schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so i took it

hamilton
i’ve always considered you a friend

burr
i don’t see why that has to end
hamilton
you changed parties to run against my fatherinlaw

burr
i changed parties to seize the opportunity i saw
i swear your pride will be the death of us all
beware it goeth before the fall9embed"
