holding back no
go without you
i dont wanna be with you
uh uh ayy 40 what that is

verse 1
lil wooski aint your average teen he see the opps gon bang it out
he know exactly how to hit they block like thats his favorite route
ayy lil nigga if you send some shots you better make it count
rps touch his brain cells rearrange his scalp
they killed lamp he took three with him they all know what your name about
aint see you in so long its like your voice is slowly fadin out
love my niggas right or wrong no i would never trade em out
aint thuggin cause he mean it these lil niggas in a race for clout
block died we threw up xs timtim died we thrеw up ts
twin nem died we bangin ls i wish that thеy aint never leave
for killa ks to the brain im scorin if i catch the gs
forever stuntin like im durb i keep a few tricks up my sleeve

interlude
god i know im nothin like them
im just different im built different
i feel as if we all got a purpose and we all special in some way
but me my potential is unmatched
im the chosen one
but only timell tell long live the guys
uh
you might also likeverse 2
say fuck the opposites but deep down we really all alike
since the elementary our elders gave us small advice
this shit could lead to death and jail its crazy how they all was right
i was playin aau with ed it was ball is life
wish i couldve warned him in advance fore he lost his life
game time call troopers for backup before we call for christ
was real to him whole time while he sharpened his knife
he put it in my back for racks aint know his heart had a price
everything done in the dark gon come to light
tryna choose your thoughts over your feelings thats the hardest fight
had to prove em wrong they said my dreams was out of sight
now its 50k up in my jeans on chartered flights
and we rock the hardest ice

outro
holding back no
go without you
i dont wanna be with you yeah12embed"
