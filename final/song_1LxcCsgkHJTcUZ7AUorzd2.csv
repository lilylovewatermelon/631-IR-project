its funny when you find yourself
lookin from the outside
im standin here but all i want
is to be over there
why did i let myself believe
miracles could happen
cause now i have to pretend
that i dont really care

chorus gabriella
i thought you were my fairytale
my dream when im not sleepin
a wish upon a star thats comin true
but everybody else could tell
that i confused my feelings with the truth
when there was me and you

verse 2 gabriella
i swore i knew the melody
that i heard you singin
and when you smiled you made me feel
like i could sing along
but then you went and changed the words
now my heart is empty
im only left with usedtobes
and once upon a song
you might also likechorus gabriella
now i know youre not a fairytale
and dreams were meant for sleepin
and wishes on a star just dont come true
cause now even i can tell
that i confused my feelings with the truth
because i liked the view
when there was me and you

bridge gabriella
i cant believe that i could be so blind
its like you were floatin while i was fallin
and i didnt mind

outro gabriella
because i liked the view oohooh oohoohooh
i thought you felt it too
when there was me and youembed"
