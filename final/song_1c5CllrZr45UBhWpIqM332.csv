do you mind if i wild out
a little
cause im just a little drunk and i wanna come party with you
a little
can i look into your eyes
i can tell that youre high too
but thats okay baby cause i just wanna party with you

chorus
cause when we hit the peak baby
i just wanna party with you
all night

verse 2
someone hold my phone cause i cant hold my tongue
cause if i get too drunk baby then im gonna ruin the fun
thats not your problem its because ive seen too much baby
sorry if i get a little ptsd

chorus

all night
because you make me happy

because you make everything
