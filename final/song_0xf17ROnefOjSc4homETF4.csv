with not a mark upon his silky hide
teach him he can trust me like a brother
one day we´ll saddle up and ride

and we´re gonna ride we´re gonna ride
ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
with the devil close behind
we´re gonna ride

i´m gonna find me a reckless woman
razor blade and dice in her eyes
just a touch of sadness in her fingers
thunder and lightning in her thighs

and we´re gonna ride we´re gonna ride
ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
with the devil close behind
we´re gonna ride

i´m gonna chase the sky forever
with the woman and the stallion and the wind
the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
before we ever pass this way again

and we´re gonna ride we´re gonna ride
ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
with the devil close behind
we´re gonna rideyou might also likeembed"
