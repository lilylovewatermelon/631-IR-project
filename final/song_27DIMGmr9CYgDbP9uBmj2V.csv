hmm i got a feelin she keeps me in the dark
i gotta keep my eye on her she aint no walk in the park
i bought her this but she want that she she she want it all
you see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad
i got a little tip from the word on the block
people sayin i shouldnt get involved
but i didnt judge or try to change it cause you are who you are
im like a drug shes addicted to me she cant keep me now
she always makin plans today come and find me tomorrow
goodbye girl

chorus she wants revenge
shes too invested in the hours that pass her by
id pay attention if i thought it was worth the time
id tell her easy but her hands they find a way
confusing passion for the love he never gave
fall back on reasons that we know wont stand a chance
watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
id tell her easy but her hands they find a way
confusing passion for the love he never gave

verse 2 timbaland
i couldnt get rid of shorty if i wanted cause she was down
but i was tired of playin the role like i aint know that she get around
somethin bout this girl fascinates me
shes the type that like to hang with the stars
the way she makes me feel and sedates me
who knew we would take it this far
everywhere that i try to go she got a wanted poster with my face on it
soon as i walk out the do there it is wanted poster with my face on it
cant blame myself when its not my fault cause nothin is promised
at least i can say i was honest  goodbye girl
