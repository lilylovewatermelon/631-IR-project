roll the clip and run it back im really like that
im really not friendly i need my credit niggas hate that
i need the numbers
i need the data got you talkin crazy
abracadabra you niggas sideshow
im bobbin like psycho
you gassin like texaco
infection like microbe
you test it i might go
you push it i might pop
im fuckin on heartthrobs
i got your favorite rapper blocked
i heard the dick was whack
your favorite athlete screamin text me back
i make no exception
the lesser part of me loves all the cap
he screamin get back togеther
im screamin back of the bus trick
hawaii for wеather
booty softer than leather
these hoes is featherweight
i wipe my phone and gave some dome i beat the case
them ho accusations weak
them bitch accusations true
you hatin from nosebleeds i wish you well
