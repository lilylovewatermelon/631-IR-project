september took the tourists and settled in for good
we could hear the trains again
brooklyn girls in scarves
summer left and no one said a word
and wed open your window and stay in your bed
all day til the streetlights came on

what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms
what happened to feeling cheap radio songs
what happened to thinking that the world was flat
what happened

so up on 59th steet right before the rains
lovers catching taxis going downtown
im talking to whats left of you
im watching what i say
counting all the freckles on your perfect face
you open your window i sit on your bed
just waiting for right words to come

so what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms
what happened to feeling cheap radio songs
what happened to thinking that the world was flat
what happened to that
you might also likewas i wrong x2

so what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms
what happened to feeling cheap radio songs
what happened to thinking that the world was flat
what happened to thatembed"
