verse 1
and for us to survive we need to uprise our people yup
must sanitize the thought of demise or freedom yup
like allstate youre in good hands with me though
taking our children they got us searchin like for nemo yuh
i wont take no shit from the government ah woah
they been had plans for this wasnt suddenly ah woah
and any time i can i take the systems hand and crumble it ah ah
whenever you can make a difference yell it out dont mumble it
i distract myself from the world to stay in my element
the heart i carry takes on the weight of good peoples negligence
so if the government dont give a shit you cant say that again
cause we already feel the same way about how they handle shit

bust up teeth for my lunch bitch with no discussion
