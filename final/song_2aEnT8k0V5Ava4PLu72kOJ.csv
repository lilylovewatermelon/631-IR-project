lay your head down
hold on to my lovin
were both gonna need it now
take it easy mama
lay your head down
rest your head on my shoulder
its a long way into town

its hard
when youre alone
its hard
when everybodys free

take it easy mama
lay your head down
hold on to my lovin
were both gonna need it now
take it easy mama
lend me your smile
let your falling head come down
ground me with your smile

its hard
when youre alone
its hard
when everybodys free
its hard
when youre alone
its hard
when everybodys stoned
