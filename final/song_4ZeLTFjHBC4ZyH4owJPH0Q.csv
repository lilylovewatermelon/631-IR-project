he gets up before the dawn
packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
its another day in the dusty haze
those burnin rays are wearin down his body
the diesels worth the price of gold
its the cheapest grain hes ever sold
but hes still holdin on

chorus
he just takes the tractor another round
and pulls the plow across the ground
and sends up another prayer
he says lord i never complain i never ask why
please dont let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky

verse 2
that hail storm back in 83
sure did take a toll on his family
but he stayed strong and carried on
just like his dad and granddad did before him
on his knees every night
he prays please let my crops and children grow
cause thats all hes ever known

he just takes the tractor another round
and pulls the plow across the ground
and sends up another prayer
he says lord i never complain i never ask why
please dont let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky
and he takes the tractor another round another round
another round another round another round
and he takes the tractor another round another round
he says i never complain i never ask why
please dont let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky
