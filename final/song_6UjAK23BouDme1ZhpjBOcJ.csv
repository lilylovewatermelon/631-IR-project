sometimes when i lie
i know youre on to me
sometimes i dont mind
how hateful that i can be
sometimes i dont try
to make you happy
i dont know why i do
the things i do to you but

chorus
sometimes i dont wanna be better
sometimes i cant be put back together
sometimes i find it hard to believe
theres someone else who could be
just as messed up as me

verse 2
sometimes dont deny
that everything is wrong
sometimes rather die
than to admit its my fault
sometimes when you cry
i just dont care at all
i dont know why i do
the things i do to you but

sometimes i dont wanna be better
sometimes i cant be put back together
sometimes i find it hard to believe
theres someone else who could be
just as messed up as me

guitar solo

bridge
i want someone to hurt
like the way i hurt
its sick but it makes me feel better
sometimes i cant hide
the demons that i face
sometimes dont deny
im sometimes sinner sometimes saint

chorus
sometimes i dont want to be better
everything is wrong forever
sometimes i cant be put back together
sometimes its gone forever
sometimes i find it hard to believe
theres someone else who could be
just as messed up as me
just as messed up as me1embed"
