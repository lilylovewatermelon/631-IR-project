the same sky the same clouds the same dirt
the same ground we all live and die on
the same song the same beat the same car
the same street we run down our dreams on

chorus
and were lost and were found were up and were down
were all just american crazy
were left and were right were black and were white
were all just american crazy
just american crazy

verse 2
straight as and dropouts up north and down south
we all bleed the same blood
paycheck to paycheck sun up to sun set
were lovers and leavers and were sinners and believers

chorus
and were lost were found were up and were down
were all just american crazy
were left and were right were black and were white
were all just american crazy
just american crazy

chorus
were lost and were found were up and were down
were all just american crazy
were left were right were black and were white
