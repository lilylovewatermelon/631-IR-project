keep holding on
when my brains ticking like a bomb
guess the black thoughts
have come again to get me
sweet bitter words
unlike nothing i have heard
sing along mockingbird
you dont affect me

refrain
thats right
deliver it to my heart
please strike
be deliberate deliberate

chorus
wait im coming undone
irate im coming undone
too late im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate
wait im starting to suffocate
and soon i anticipate
im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate

choke choke again
i thought my demons were my friends
pity me in the end
theyre out to get me
since i was young
ive tasted sorrow on my tongue
and the sweet sugar gun
does not protect me

refrain
thats right
trigger between my eyes
please strike
make it quick now now

chorus
wait im coming undone
irate im coming undone
too late im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate
wait im starting to suffocate
and soon i anticipate
im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate
bridge
im trying to hold it together
head is lighter than a feather
looks like im not getting better
not getting better

chorus
wait im coming undone
irate im coming undone
too late im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate
wait im starting to suffocate
and soon i anticipate
im coming undone
what looks so strong so delicate17embed"
