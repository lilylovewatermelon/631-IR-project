dont take yourself so seriously
look at you all dressed up for someone you never see
youre here for a reason but you dont know why
youre split and uneven your hands to the sky
surrender yourself

chorus
and i wonder why i tear myself down to be built back up again
oh i hope somehow ill wake up young again
all thats left of myself holes in my false confidence
and now i lay myself down and hope i wake up young again

postchorus
hope i wake up young again

verse 2
dont let those demons in again
i fill the void up with polished doubt fake sentiment
surrender yourself

chorus
and i wonder why i tear myself down to be built back up again
oh i hope somehow ill wake up young again
all thats left of myself holes in my false confidence
and now i lay myself down and hope i wake up young again

why wont you take me seriously

chorus
and i wonder why i tear myself down to be built back up again
oh i hope somehow ill wake up young again
all thats left of myself holes in my false confidence
and now i lay myself down and hope i wake
i wonder why i tear myself down to be built back up again
oh i hope somehow i wake up young again
all thats left of myself holes in my false confidence
and now i lay myself down and hope i wake up young again
