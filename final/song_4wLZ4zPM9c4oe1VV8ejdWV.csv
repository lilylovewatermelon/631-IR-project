another summer day has come and gone away
in paris and rome but i wanna go home mmm
may be surrounded by a million people i
still feel all alone
i just wanna go home
oh i miss you you know
and ive been keeping all the letters that i wrote to you
each one a line or two
im fine baby how are you
well i would send them but i know that its just not enough
my words were cold and flat
and you deserve more than that
another aeroplane another sunny place
im lucky i know but i wanna go home
mmm i got to go home

chorus
let me go home
im just too far from where you are
i wanna come home

verse 2
and i feel just like im living someone elses life
its like i just stepped outside
when everything was going right
and i know just why you could not come along with me
that this was not your dream
but you always believed in me
another winter day has come and gone away
in either paris or rome and i wanna go home
let me go home
and im surrounded by a million people i
i still feel alone
oh let me go home
oh i miss you you know

and baby im done

let me go home

outro
itll all be alright
