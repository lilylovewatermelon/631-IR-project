you got your way with me now didnt you
and i dont know why
things you do are things weve done before
dont you be looking at me darling with your sneaky eyes
now what could you be looking at me for

prechorus
sometimes when im lonely i close my eyes
some nights when i cant sleep i fantasize
hard to believe that youre right here tonight
im going out of my mind

chorus
oh i think this could be the one night
i give into this fight
boy i just might cause you rule my head
i cant stop the motion
hold me be the way you told me
whisper something so sweet
this could be the night
wrong feels so right
this could be the night
wrong feels so right so right so right

verse 2
its breaking my heart to see you lover and i dont know why
things you say are things youve said before
instead of the truth i swear youd stick a needle in your eye
now what can you be looking at me for

bridge
tell me what was i supposed to do with that type of attention
i gave all that i had to you
you forget to mention
when you say that your heart is true
its just an invention but not your intention no no

its just an invention but not your intention no no
