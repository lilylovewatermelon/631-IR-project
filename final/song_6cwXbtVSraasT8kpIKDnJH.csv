let that hate dissolve flyest niggas in the party

verse
she a model girl i put my hands all on her body
i dont do average girl she ride me cause she feelin gnarly
i got a backwood i be smokin like im bob marley
take a puff skrrt off fast like im in a rari
i be on some shit that people never seen before
he said he down to ride but switched up that is not your bro
she said she fuck with you but talkin bout you on the low
im just sayin shorty choosin gotta watch your hoe
takin chances that they told me that i shouldnt take
now i sit back and laugh at them cause they was full of hate
and time is money we cant talk if it aint bout the cake
now you an actor fake bitch just get out my face

chorus
i just wanna ball tell my haters that im sorry
yeah i want it all tell me who is gonna stop me
let that hate dissolve flyest niggas in the party
i step in this bitch feelin like im john gotti
i just wanna ball tell my haters that im sorry
yeah i want it all tell me who is gonna stop me
let that hate dissolve flyest niggas in the party
i step in this bitch feelin like im john gottiyou might also like8embed"
