you knocked me sideways
when you said that you were leaving
it knocked me over
when you cried and told the truth
and it left me speechless
the secrets youve been keeping
youre running now cause someones chasing you

and you bought a ticket
but you dont know where youre going
and you wont tell me
for fear ill follow suit
and youre trying to save me
from your past of bad decisions
but my decisions always gonna be
to follow you to follow you

never letting go til my lungs stop breathing
