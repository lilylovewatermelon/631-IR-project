how do i make you fall in love with me
and how would i let you know i care
and how would i say that the man youre laying with
is not the man that should be laying there

verse 1
how would a boy like me put it
a man with some sense probably wouldnt
but i dont give a damn i am not a smart man
im gonna say some words i shouldnt

verse 2
and i had a dream i was falling
and maybe thats a fucked up metaphor
maybe it just means when i meet you in my dreams
nothing stops me from going through the floor

verse 3
and i know all the bad things about you
but i still think youre the purest of our kind
i remember being younger with an awful pining hunger
for a good that a boy could never find
and a fear of a man so left behind

verse 4
so i guess ill just love you from the window
while youre dancing with the charmers in the room
and ill sneak out that door like i have a time before
and just let that lost loving loom
and just let that lost loving loom

and how do i make you fall in love with me
is it lost in the emptiness of apathy
should i fight for it like war should i nail it down to boards
or do i live in a love im dying for

outro
and how do i make you fall in love with me
and how do i let you know i care
and how would i say that the man youre laying with
is not the man that should be laying thereembed"
