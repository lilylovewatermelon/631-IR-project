dear mother can you hear me whinin
its been three whole weeks since that i have left your home
this sudden fear has left me tremblin
cause now it seems that i am out here on my own
and im feelin so alone

chorus
pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i wanna take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

verse 2
a gunshot rings out at the station
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
it makes me wonder why im still here
for some strange reason its now feelin like my home
and im never gonna go

chorus
pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i wanna take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

verse 3
dear mother can you hear me laughin
its been six whole months since that i have left your home
it makes me wonder why im still here
for some strange reason its now feelin like my home
and im never gonna go

chorus
pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i wanna take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise
