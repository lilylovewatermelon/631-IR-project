a little country church on a two lane road
a bride and a groom coming out the door
white lace dress and a red bouquet
just married written on a blue chevrolet

chorus
dont that make you want to fall in love
dont that look like a picture of us
a match made in heaven if there ever was
dont that make you want to fall
that just makes me want to give you my heart
ever forever needs a place to start
gotta be a sign from up above
dont that make you want to fall in love

verse 2
old folks sitting in a front porch swing
still holding hands like they were sixteen
fifty good years theyre a lovers dream
darling that could be you and me

chorus
dont that make you want to fall in love
dont that look like a picture of us
a match made in heaven if there ever was
dont that make you want to fall
that just makes me want to give you my heart
ever forever needs a place to start
gotta be a sign from up above
dont that make you want to fall in love
yeah yeah
well now dont that make you want to fall in lovesee kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeembed"
