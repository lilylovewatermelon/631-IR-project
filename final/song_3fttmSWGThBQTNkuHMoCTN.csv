ill lay me down tonight
much further down
swim in the calm tonight
this art does drown

chorus
what follows me as the whitest lace of light
will swallow whole just begs to be imbrued
what follows has led me to this place
where i belong with all erased
what follows

verse 2
all insects sing tonight
the coldest sound
id send gods grace tonight
could it be found

chorus
what follows me as the whitest lace of light
will swallow whole just begs to be imbrued
what follows has led me to this place
where i belong with all erased

bridge
ill lay me down tonight
much further down
watch stars go out tonight
on sinking ground
you might also likeill lay me down ill lay me down

chorus
what follows me as the whitest lace of light
will swallow whole just begs to be imbrued
what follows has led me to this place
where i belong with all erased

outro
what follows will swallow whole
what follows will swallow wholeembed"
