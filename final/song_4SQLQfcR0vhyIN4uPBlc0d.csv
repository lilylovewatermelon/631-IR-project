i get up i get down
and im jumpin around
and the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
been a hell of a ride
but im thinking its time to grow
bang bang bang
so i got an apartment across from the park
put quinoa in my fridge
still im not feeling grown
been a hell of a ride
but im thinking its time to go
bang bang bang here we go

pretend you know this song everybody

im way too old to try so whatever
