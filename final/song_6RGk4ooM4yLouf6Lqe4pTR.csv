verse 1
were painted as monsters borracho cansado
and do you know what the people say
i pluck from the garden of wretched beliefs
i offer a rose and smile with harmless teeth

prechorus 1
then slick back my hair you know the devils in there
alone in the garden
like lumbering giants in a shameful parade
we came to ruin all and make a rotten trade
and make you roll over
so roll over
get over

refrain
scattered all on the shore
surely theyre washed away

chorus 1
feeling somewhat deserving of what will be someday
no i can never stay melancholy ive the memory of your face
no i can never stay melancholy for long
before i move on
you might also likeverse 2
were unwanted strangers exploited and dangerous
unable to hide or even dream of it
¿cómo estás parting the seas
were lepers who stroll why you afraid sweety

prechorus 2
i slick back my hair you know the devils in there
so keep one eye open baby
were so easy to spot lepers riding atop
pachyderms made of germs
elephants broken and screaming and all
roll over
are we comin over

refrain
scattered all on the shore
surely theyre washed away
scattered all on the shore
surely theyre washed away
away away

chorus 2
feeling somewhat deserving of what will be someday
no i can never stay melancholy ive the memory of your face
im alone in the garden of long lost hopeful plans
no i can never stay anything for long
bridge
so come on move
roll over
are we comin over
here we go
