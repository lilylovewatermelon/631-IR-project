when i came down the dawn poured into me
i shook em up the walls came crumbling
my fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
my stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
now painting rainbows on my ugly face
i built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
but i ascend and serve my feverish need
within the confines of such chemistry

prechorus
its the way i see
everything i need
its no way to be

chorus
let this be our little secret
no one needs to know were feeling
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
but i feel alive and i feel it in me
up and up i keep on climbing
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
higher higher higher higher

my face blew up at such a casual sight
the smattered colours of ecstatic fright
the rush above me to oblivion
outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
how come it takes some people so damn long
he tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
the citrus drawing out the seasons stains

prechorus
watch the basin drain
as your life lines wane
and you cant explain
as your friends complain
youve caused all this pain
and you proudly shame
your whole familys name

chorus
let this be our little secret
no one needs to know were feeling
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
but i feel alive and i feel it in me
up and up i keep on climbing
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
bridge
mother i can tell what youve been thinking
staring at the stars on your ceiling
thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
and now ive hit the mark
stabbing at the dark
and i cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

chorus
let this be our little secret
no one needs to know were feeling
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
but i feel alive and i feel it in me
up and up i keep on climbing
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
let this be our little secret
no one needs to know were feeling
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
but i feel alive and i feel it in me
up and up i keep on climbing
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher11embed"
