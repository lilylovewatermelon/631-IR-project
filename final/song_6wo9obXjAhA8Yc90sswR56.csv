no if ands buts or maybes
so you want to be her baby
i can read your face like a book
yeah it looks easy to love her but believe me brother
its harder than it looks

chorus
shes as pretty as a picture
every bit as funny as she is smart
got a smile thatll hold you together
and a touch thatll tear you apart
when shes yours she brings the sunshine
when shes gone the world goes dark
yeah shes heaven on the eyes
but boy shes hell on the heart yeah

verse 2
yeah shes good when shes bad
shes cute when shes mad
and she does all the wrong things right
yeah boy its a fact when theyre made like that
you aint ever gonna sleep at night

chorus
shes as pretty as a picture
every bit as funny as she is smart
got a smile thatll hold you together
and a touch thatll tear you apart
when shes yours she brings the sunshine
when shes gone the world goes dark
yeah shes heaven on the eyes
but boy shes hell on the heart
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
once you feel her touch and youve felt that rush
its going to mess up your head
but heres the kicker son
your old tickers going to beat you half to death

chorus
shes as pretty as a picture
every bit as funny as she is smart
got a smile thatll hold you together
and a touch thatll tear you apart
when shes yours she brings the sunshine
when shes gone the world goes dark
yeah shes heaven on the eyes
but boy shes hell on the heart8embed"
