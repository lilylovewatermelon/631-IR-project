ignoring a loss of sight
afraid to blink i might lose the sun
but dont make this out to be more than it isnt
behind every lie theres a burden within
yes youre my sight

bridge
this suffering
thats kept within
disposable men
lost

verse 2
inside he was negative
this place once more was underground
so look and connect were refusing to rust
healing has to begin in the past

chorus
so dont fake this dont fake this
dont fake this dont

bridge
this suffering you you
thats kept within you you
disposable men you you
