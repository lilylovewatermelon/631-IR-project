bitch fuck uh uh fuck
you have a question

verse 1 tyler the creator
how many cars can i buy til i run outta drive
how much drive can i have until i run outta road
how much road can they pave until i run outta land
how much land can it be until i run in the ocean
niggas go with the motions and all the plans
see i was never into the beaches and all the sands
see i was in the woods with flowers rainbows and posies
fallin outta my pocket but yall want to know if i swam to cool down
how much cooler can i get until i run out of fans
how many fans can i have until they turn on the ac
if the ac blow up well then im tnt im gone

bridge rex orange county
im gone and im finished
and i aint seen my friends in a minute
guessing nothing lasts forever
yeah nothing lasts forever
nothing sticks together
sick of sitting in doubt
please let me figure this out out
see tyler the creator liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likeverse 2 tyler the creator
shout out to the girls that i led on
for occasional head and always keepin my bed warm
and tryin their hardest to keep my head on straight
and keepin me up enough til i had thought i was airborne
how many raps can i write til i get me a chain
how many chains can i wear til im considered a slave
how many slaves can it be til nat turner arise
how many riots can it be until them black lives matter
niggas clickclack splatter pew pew that nigga
life a game of basketball you better shoot that nigga
cause if that cop got trigger he better pull yeah
cause when i get pulled over i usually play it cool skrt
cause i know what im drivin is usually paid in full
and my ego and possessions will not let me be one nah
because i got a mansion my mansion got some rooms
them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views yup
them views get some stares and my backyard does too
and if you walk to the bottom youll prolly see a pool
you better not drown keep them ten toes up
cause if them ten toes down that mean that you fucked up
and thats what i swim in

outro rex orange county
and if i drown and dont come back
whos gonna know maybe then ill know
and if i crash and dont come back
whos gonna know maybe then ill know
and if i fall and dont come back
whos gonna know maybe then ill know
im wondering if i dont come back
maybe then ill know
dont come back
dont come back
ayy dont come back
dont come back
