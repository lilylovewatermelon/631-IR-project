you say that youre leavin but i dont think i can let go
when you put the phone down i began to cry
what are you to do when the person that you love just says no
boy get yourself together move on with your life

prechorus sam smith
so im gonna play my favourite rhythm
gotta get you out my system
i would do anything to keep you off my mind
im gonna have to call my sisters
be around the ones who listen
anything to drown you out tonight

chorus sam smith  the dap kingshorns
baby you make me crazy
whyd you have to fill my heart with sorrow
save me make it all hazy
so i dont think about you til tomorrow

verse 2
it wasnt enough but you couldve had the guts to face me
it would have meant so much if youd looked me in the eye
oh why do i always fall for the ones who have no courage
i must see some kind of beauty in their lies
