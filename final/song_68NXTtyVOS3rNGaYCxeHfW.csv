afraid to be myself
alone i cant be loved
i stare through your soul
to find something meaningful
something that cant grow old

chorus
i know where you are and why youre there
its making it hard to disappear
i see you in the walls where i sleep
your tight grip it suffocates me

verse 2
picked last
im a reject
at least i was loved
when i was a kid
im feeling the distance
its so hard to talk when you turn away
in your home i dont feel safe

chorus
i know where you are and why youre there
its making it hard to disappear
i see you in the walls where i sleep
your tight grip it suffocates me
you might also likebridge
no ones deserving
to have this feeling
so overwhelming
to feel this away
