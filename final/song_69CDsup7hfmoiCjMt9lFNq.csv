this hidden thing
that you dont see
they call them skeletons
but dont be scared of them
cause youre still you
and im still me
its all irrelevant
we all got skeletons

prechorus
you could tell me everything
and then we could forget it
baby you could show me all your demons in a minute
it could be a battle
when the words come back around around
we dont ever got to tell a lie
and then relive it
i could show you demons
only you could take a minute
show me that youll be there
when the walls come crashing down

chorus
when youre holding back the words
cause youre afraid of being hurt
just let love in
just let love in
oh were only skin and bone
we dont have to be alone
just let love in
just let love in
i just let love in
just let love in

sink or swim
what will it be
we all got skeletons
set them free
but now im over it
and im under you
so tell me everything
take a trip to the moon

chorus
oh when youre holding back the words
cause youre afraid of being hurt
just let love in
just let love in
oh were only skin and bone
we dont have to be alone
just let love in
just let love in
i just let love in
just let love in

you could tell me everything

baby you could show me all your demons in a minute

when the words come back around around
we dont ever got to tell a lie
and then relive it
i could show you demons
only you could take a minute
tell me that youll be there
when the walls come crashing down down
chorus
oh when youre holding back the words
cause youre afraid of being hurt
just let love in
just let love in
oh were only skin and bone
we dont have to be alone
just let love in
just let love in
i just let love in
just let love in
i just let love in
