emotions inside us troubling
the hatred inside us escalating
the sickness inside us keeps you weak
the masses inside of us suffering they are bleeding
the calling inside us sick with greed
the voices calling to us deafening were not listening

chorus 1
cannot receive the obvious
line up cattle and cut the necks
swat at the flies omit disgust

verse 2
the leaders inside us posturing
the pollution inside of us suffocating me
the science inside us menacing
the will thats inside of us its dying end is coming

chorus 2
cannot receive the obvious
line up cattle and cut the necks
drain us of life and cleanse the mess

bridge
cleanse the mess cleanse the mess
cleanse the mess cleanse the mess
wash me off inside
wash me off inside
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likewere killing ourselves were killing ourselves
were killing ourselves killers
god damn we fucked up the circumstance
too late to save us from ourselves
callous minds against trust and confidence
too late to give a damn now
too late to save us from ourselves
too late to make it all go away
too late to beg pardons from the mother
too late to give a damn
its too late to save us from ourselves
its too late to make it all go away
its too late to beg pardons from the mother
its too late to give a damn now well sit and wait
wait wait wait for the coming of the end
wait for the coming the killing the ending the plight of man
deserving no mercy expelling by gods hand
its okay the ending its over no more pain
no more pain no more pain
emotion the hatred the sickness the calling

chorus 1
cannot receive the obvious
line up cattle and cut the necks
swat at the flies omit disgust
outro
drain us of life and cleanse the mess3embed"
