when the dogwoods start to bloom
and the crickets hum their tune
thats usually about the time
that i feel most alive
but the news has all been bad
and the whole world seems so sad
i aint had much else going on
so i sat down and wrote this song

chorus
i miss my mom i miss my dad
miss the road i miss my band
giving hugs and shaking hands
its a mystery i suppose
just how long this thing goes
but therell be crowds and therell be shows
and there will be light after dark
some day when we arent six feet apart

verse 2
first thing that im gonna do
slide on in some corner booth
and take the whole damn family out
buy my buddies all a round
pay some extra on the tab
catch a movie catch a cab
watch a ball game from the stands
probably overwash my hands
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
i miss my mom i miss my dad
miss the road i miss my band
giving hugs and shaking hands
well its a mystery i suppose
just how long this thing goes
but therell be crowds and therell be shows
and there will be light after dark
some day when we arent six feet apart

chorus
i miss my mom i miss my dad
i miss the road i miss my band
giving hugs and shaking hands
well its a mystery i suppose
just how long this thing goes
but therell be crowds and therell be shows
and there will be light after dark
some day when we arent six feet apart

outro
there will be light after dark
some day when we arent six feet apart1embed"
