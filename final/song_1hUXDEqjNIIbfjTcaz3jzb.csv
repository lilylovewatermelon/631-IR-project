maybe one day ill fall in a bookstore
into the arms of a guy
well sneak into bars
and gaze at the stars
surrounded by fireflies

verse 2
oh id like to sleep in til two on a sunday
and listen to the bluebirds sigh
get soaked in the rain
and smile through the pain
slow dance under stormy skies

chorus
maybe im just old fashioned
read too many fairytales
its no wonder ive had no luck
no ones ever good enough
i want a love like ive seen in the movies
thats why ill never fall in love
