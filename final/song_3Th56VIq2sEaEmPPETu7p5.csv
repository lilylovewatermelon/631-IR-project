its just another night and im starin at the moon
i saw a shootin star and thought of you
i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
if you were here id sing to you

prechorus
youre on the other side as the skyline splits in two
im miles away from seeing you
but i can see the stars from america
i wondered do you see them too

chorus
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home

verse 2
i can hear your heart on the radio beat
theyre playin chasing cars and i thought of us
back to the time you were lying next to me
i looked across and fell in love

so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew
everything led back to you
so can you see the stars over amsterdam
youre the song my heart is beatin to

chorus
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home

outro
and oh i know
and oh i know
and oh
i can see the stars
from america58embed"
