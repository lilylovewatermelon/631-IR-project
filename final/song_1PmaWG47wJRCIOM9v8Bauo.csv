tonight bleeding from the holes in my face
but i dont want to give it away

and if you ask me to stay you know thats where i will be
wont ever do that again dont wanna do that again

verse 2
you call me baby blue
for all the evil schemes i pull
we sit and watch the waves break
i made a lot of mistakes
