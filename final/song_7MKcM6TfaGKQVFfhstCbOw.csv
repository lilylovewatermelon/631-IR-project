old pirates yes they rob i
sold i to the merchant ships
minutes after they took i
from the bottomless pit
but my hand was made strong
by the hand of the almighty

these songs of freedom
cause all i ever have

none but ourselves can free our minds
have no fear for atomic energy
cause none of them can stop the time
how long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look
ooh some say its just a part of it
weve got to fulfill the book
