get off of work and we meet down at our spot
we had a patio with a view of a parkin lot

had christmas lights in the middle of june
all hung up like i was on you

prechorus
i say hey hey baby do you wanna come over
you say no way then you move in closer

next thing i know you were in my tshirt right there
your hair messed up like a gunsnroses video
