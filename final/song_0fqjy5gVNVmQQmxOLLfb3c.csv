theres an ocean inside my head
waves that dont ever rest
this kind of beauty aint ordinary
you look but do you really see

prechorus
wont you take your time on me
cause we got nowhere else to be

chorus
well go dancing in the kitchen
you fall in my arms
baby wont you let your phone keep ringing
are you thinking what im thinking
wont you take your time on me
oh oh oh
on me
oh oh

verse 2
ill let you figure me out
tear all my fences down
weve been so tired
asleep on our feet
chasing things well never keep
see vance joy liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus
wont you take your time on me
cause we got nowhere else to be

chorus
well go dancing in the kitchen
you fall in my arms
baby wont you let your phone keep ringing
are you thinking what im thinking
we could walk away with nothing
we could go too far
ill admit i never saw you coming
now i see your colors running
wont you take your time on me
wont you take your time on me
oh oh oh
on me
oh oh

outro
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me
and you know my heart well its waiting for your call
take your time on me3embed"
