i cant understand
why you want this to end
i know i got to take a stand
ill never be some kind of friend

when the one love you had left you hurting so bad

love will make it shine
it will light up your way turning your night into day

a new sun will rise
love will make it shine

no more tears to cry
hope will free my mind
a new sun will rise
