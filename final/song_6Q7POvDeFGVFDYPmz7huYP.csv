youre red soaking wet
im right next to you
youre red soaking wet
lets writhe let me see you trip
one move that will keep you wet
lets fall in a long sadistic trance
put the keys in our hands

chorus
guns razors knives
fuck with me
guns razors knives

verse 2
youre red soaking wet
im right next to you
youre red soaking wet
lets sail in this sea of charms
lets drown underneath the stars
lets drink with our weapons in our hands
lets sleep in this trance

chorus
guns razors knives
fuck with me
guns razors knives
