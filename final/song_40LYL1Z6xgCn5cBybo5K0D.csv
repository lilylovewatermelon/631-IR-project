there are moments that the words don’t reach
there is suffering too terrible to name
you hold your child as tight as you can
and push away the unimaginable
the moments when you’re in so deep
it feels easier to just swim down

angelicaensemble
the hamiltons move uptown
and learn to live with the unimaginable

hamilton
i spend hours in the garden
i walk alone to the store
and it’s quiet uptown
i never liked the quiet before
i take the children to church on sunday
a sign of the cross at the door
and i pray
that never used to happen before

angelica and women
if you see him in the street walking by
himself talking to himself have pity
you might also likehamilton
philip you would like it uptown
it’s quiet uptown

angelica and women
he is working through the unimaginable

all men except hamilton
his hair has gone grey he passes every day
they say he walks the length of the city

hamilton
you knock me out i fall apart

company except hamilton and eliza
can you imagine

hamilton
look at where we are
look at where we started
i know i don’t deserve you eliza
but hear me out that would be enough
if i could spare his life
if i could trade his life for mine
he’d be standing here right now
and you would smile and that would be enough
i don’t pretend to know
the challenges we’re facing
i know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
and you need time
but i’m not afraid
i know who i married
just let me stay here by your side
that would be enough
company except hamilton and eliza
if you see him in the street walking by her
side talking by her side have pity

hamilton
eliza do you like it uptown it’s quiet uptown

company except hamilton and eliza
he is trying to do the unimaginable
see them walking in the park long after dark
taking in the sights of the city

hamilton
look around look around eliza

company except hamilton and eliza
they are trying to do the unimaginable

angelica
there are moments that the words don’t reach
there is a grace too powerful to name
we push away what we can never understand
we push away the unimaginable
they are standing in the garden
alexander by eliza’s side
she takes his hand
eliza
it’s quiet uptown

company except hamilton and eliza
forgiveness can you imagine
forgiveness can you imagine
if you see him in the street walking by her
side talking by her side have pity
they are going through the unimaginable40embed"
