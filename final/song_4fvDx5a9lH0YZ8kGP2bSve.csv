my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day deep into the sea
but takes a little piece of me a little piece of me

verse 1
oh its so beautiful out and i cant see why were not allowed to be
up in the sky with the birds counting the flowers
and oh my powers have failed me again when i cant see beginning to end
though i try and test it again through the hours

prechorus
wandering stars in the blue could not be born cause of you
wandering stars in the blue could not be born cause of you

chorus
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
deeper every day deep into the sea
a little piece of me a little piece of me

verse 2
oh why cant i be green as the grass beneath my feet
as fresh as the dew hits the ground in the morning
and not yellow like bumble bees please take me off my knees
my knees i dont wanna be red forever
