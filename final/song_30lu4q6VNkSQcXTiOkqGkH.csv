and hoping that its me thats floating through your mind
floating through your mind
then i get that feeling trying to stop my hands from shaking
staring at the ceiling and kneeling and making deals with the man above
yeah with the man above

oh i i
im wondering where you are tonight

i wring the sheets out when im sweating
soaking wet pacing chasing the visions
and wishing that i could kiss
instead of missing you
yeah instead of missing you
cant catch my breath kinda feels like im suffocating my minds a wreck
at best i think my heart is breaking down on me
breaking down on me

oh i i
im wondering where you are tonight
i i tell me will we ever get it right
i i im wondering where you are tonight

can you feel me when i reach for you
hear me when i say your name
see me walking through your door
or are we just too far away
too far away
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also liketell me when im out of sight am i out of mind
do you count the seconds and minutes just wanna speed up time
girl are you missing me all the ways im missing you
could you tell me how the hell im suppose to make it through

oh i i
im wondering where you are tonight
i i tell me will we ever get it right
i i im wondering where you are tonight
wondering where you are tonight

sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night thinking
drinking and smoking and hoping
i wring the sheets out when im sweating
soaking wet pacing chasing the visions and wishing yeah
cant catch my breath kinda feels like im suffocating my minds a wreck
at best i think my heart is breaking down on me
down on me
wondering where you are tonightembed"
