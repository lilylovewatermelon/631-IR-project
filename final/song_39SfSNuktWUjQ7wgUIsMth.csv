they took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
i said mary anne youre better than the world
they did a lot of things right on this girl

had a lot of girlfriends
i should have known them
click your heels and count back from three
do you wanna go back
you should have known that
the butterfly in reverse here is me

mary anne youre better than the world
they took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
i said mary anne youre better than the world
they did a lot of things right on this girl

whered you wanna go to
with nothing beside you
but webbing and curfews and rain
and everything that hurts you
is locked up inside you
like butterflies with wings
and other perfect things

we go swimming in the sunshine
dangling from clotheslines
separate and fall into me
and did you ever seen me
me absolutely
me but all you but still me
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likemary anne youre better than the world
they took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
i said mary anne youre better than the world
they did a lot of things right on this girlembed"
