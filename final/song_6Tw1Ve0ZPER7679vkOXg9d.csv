i breeze through the day
an nothin much seems to get in my way
i dont have a care at all
you walk in the room
its always the same you call out my name
i turn you smile an i fall

verse 2
im at home at night
just me an the moon were doin all right
when out of the blue you call
i hang up the phone
i lay down in bed youre still in my head
i dream you smile an i fall

bridge
oh what could this feelin be
could it really be love and its happening to me
oh yeah yeah

verse 3
the closer you get
the harder it is to keep it together
i dont have a chance at all
its out of my hands
oh but what can i do im crazy for you
we touch you smile an i fall

we touch you smile an i fallembed"
