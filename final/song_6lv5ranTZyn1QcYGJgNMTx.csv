hillbilly blood runnin through my veins
black cold soul and a mountain of pain
jug of white lightning crossin my lips
hillbilly blood dont give a shit

verse 2
hillbilly blood the river runs red
finger on the trigger and a pound of lead
chopper in the air searchin my land
a copperhead bites i dont give a goddamn

chorus
all the tongues at the tent revival
been spittin in the devils eye
there aint livin theres just survival
doesnt matter if you do or die
the way it is is the way it was
hillbilly blood hillbilly blood

verse 3
hillbilly blood thick as the night
fog lays heavy on the mornin light
pike county sheriff trackin my scent
nobody gonna know wherе it went

all the tongues at thе tent revival
been spittin in the devils eye
there aint livin theres just survival
doesnt matter if you do or die
and the way it is is the way it was
