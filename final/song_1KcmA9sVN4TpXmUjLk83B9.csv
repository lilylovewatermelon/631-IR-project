ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
i am god motherfuckers better bow down

verse 1 lil murder
dead bodies all around hunnid rounds out
smell it in the air everytime im fuckin round town
lay em down one by one i pick em off without sound
cock the hammer back brains splat hauled off on a bloody mat
chain snatched i like the way it shines when im back in black
blood diamonds glisten hear the victims yell why
got the choir singin all the songs of fuckin hell
as i hear the voices swell i know the demons wish me well
bath salts in the nose feel like eatin a fuckers face
now im speeding in the bronco like its 1998
take away the cameras motherfucker now its war time
behind enemy lines ptsd just means im high
bring me life bring me life so i can end it on my own time
meetin the reaper all day tryna take me off the frontlines
i just want some peace of mind sick and tired of feelin tired

verse 2 7th ward lord
i declare war armageddon let us swarm
ill bring the fuckin storm bury me in uniform
units form under the rising sun
g59 the tide has come
wash the blood unite as scum
fill the air with tyrant dust
tonight we die grey flags wave em high
point your guns up at the sky yelling we know god has died
palm trees drip with fuckin fire smoke and ash all in my eyes
its war time all the fucking time
now who wanna die
follow me we can see the other side
and if anyones in the way rip out their spine
leave em behind and repeat til we die
grey59 army we bleed til we dry
enemies nothin but enemies
kill em all burn it all down no new friends
well piss on their graves and then claim its our legacy
we were all doomed written in our destiny
peace it will never be
at least til i am deceased underneath the ground
shoot off a round watch me bleed
got the lead separatin my head tag my feet
bury me in the sea and try not to forget me
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeoutro 7th ward lord  the 60s
ill become a ghost and haunt you daily
hell no we wont go hell no we wont go
taunt you til you remember me daily
hell no we wont go hell no we wont go21embed"
