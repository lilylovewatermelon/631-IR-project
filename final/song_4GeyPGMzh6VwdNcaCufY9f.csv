well i wanna send a postcard
from the edge of a place i’ve never been
and i wanna make love hard
under the stars in the back of a beatup old k10
and i wanna love a girl who
doesn’t worry about the pictures when we kiss
and wake up one day and not be so hit and miss
and lay in bed all day and call that shit pure bliss

chorus
cuz i’m movin’ at god speed
only god and my mama know what i need
and i feel the hardwood floors on my knees
as i beg you just to take it easy on me
i’m movin’ at god speed

verse 2
well i wanna see the road melt
into the mountains away as i drive
and make it out of this damn town alive
and not let the dreams i shouldered die

chorus
cuz i’m movin’ at god speed
only god and my mama know what i need
and i feel the hardwood floors on my knees
as i beg you just to take it easy on me
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 3
well i wanna die an old man
messed up stories of me and my old friends
and laugh about how we all thought it won’t end
how we all wind up where we began

chorus
movin’ at god speed
where only god and our mamas know what we need
and we feel the hardwood floors on our knees
as we beg the world to bring us to our feet
cuz i’m moving at god speed
only god and my mama know what i need
and i feel the hardwood floors on my knees
as i beg you just to take it easy on me
i’m movin’ at god speedembed"
