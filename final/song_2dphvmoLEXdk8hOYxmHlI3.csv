two three four
thats a bit fast
one two three

verse 1 chris martin
they were sittin they were sittin on the strawberry swing
every moment was so precious
they were sittin they were talkin on the strawberry swing
everybody was for fightin
wouldnt wanna waste a thing

chorus chris martin
cold cold water bring me round
now my feet wont touch the ground
cold cold water what you say
when its such its such a perfect day
its such a perfect day

verse 2 chris martin
i remember we were walkin up to strawberry swing
i cant wait till the mornin
wouldnt wanna change a thing

chorus chris martin
