verse 3 kelis
give me the chance to dance romance
dont run im not the sun ha
so much at stake oh bad choice of words
but im not the gun shut up
with silver bullets
and i can count one two three
plus i make great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches van helsing

outro kelis
for richer or poorer
through sickness and in health
til death do us part
til death do us part
you only live once
well not in our case
cause we live forever4embed"
