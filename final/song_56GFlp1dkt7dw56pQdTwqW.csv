well ask if we can have six in
if not well have to have two
well youre comin up at our end arent ya
so ill get one with you
wont he let us have six in
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no though
he didnt have to be rude
you see her with the green dress
she talked to me at the bar
well how come its already twopound fifty
weve only gone about a yard
didnt you see she were gorgeous
she were beyond belief
but this lad at the side drinkin his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef

chorus 1
and im sitting going backwards
and i didnt want to leave
i said its high green mate
via hillsborough please

verse 2
well how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank
oh no you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squarin up proper shoutin
bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing thatd seem so silly
but not when theyve both had a few
you might also likebridge
well calm down temper temper
you shouldnt get so annoyed
well youre actin like a silly little boy
oh they wanted to be men
and do some fightin in the street
he said no surrender no chance of retreat

instrumental break

chorus 2
and so why are they in the taxi
cause i didnt wanna leave
i said its high green mate
via hillsborough please

verse 3
drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around are you sure
went for it but the red light was showin
and red light indicates doors are secure22embed"
