my friends are all hurting from moments and regrets
and charity laced with a lie
and still we keep hoping to fix all the defects
and strengthen these seminal ties
we go on together for better or worse
our history is too real to hate
now and forever we stay until morning
and promise to fight for our fate

chorus
til we die til we die

verse 2
the start of the journey is every bit worth it
i cant let you down anymore
the sky is still clearing were never afraid
and the consequence opens the door
ive never stopped to trying ive never stopped to feeling
like family is much more than blood
dont go on without me the piece that i represent
compliments each and every one

chorus
til we die til we die
we wont be forgotten well never give in
this war weve achieved has allowed us to win
til we die til we die

my last true confession will open your eyes
ive never known trust like the nine
let it be spoken let it be screamed
theyll never ever take us alive

chorus
til we die til we die
we wont be forgotten well never give in
this war weve achieved has allowed us to win
carry on carry on

bridge
well never be broken we wont be denied
our war is the pressure we need to unite
well never be broken we wont be denied
our war is the pressure we need to unite

chorus
til we die til we die
we wont be forgotten well never give in
this war weve achieved has allowed us to win
carry on carry on
well never be broken we wont be denied
our war is the pressure we need to unite
til we die til we die
outro
til we die til we die
til we die til we die5embed"
