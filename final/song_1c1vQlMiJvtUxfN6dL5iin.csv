there was a time i was down down
i didnt know what to do
i was just stumbling around around
thinking things could not improve
i couldnt look on the bright side
of anything at all
thats when you gave me a call

chorus
now i feel better better
better than before
i feel better better
better now im not down anymore

verse 2
and there were times i was sure so sure
i couldnt turn it around
i couldnt care any more
about the good things i found
thats when you gave me a reason
to make me smile again
only have to see you and then

chorus
i feel better better
better than before
i feel better better
now im not down anymore
i feel better better
better than before
i feel better better
now im not down anymore

life sometimes seems to get the best of you
like everything just brings you down
just when you think theres nothing you can do
a friendly face will bring you around
and youll feel better

chorus
youll feel better youll feel better
better than before
youll feel better much better
no you wont be down anymore
