verse 2 50 cent
 is always focused we move around with the toasters
push the rock to the smokers warning do not approach us
we in the club with the pokers steppin in gucci loafers
stuntin in testerossas stylin in front of vultures
ma quickly to call us baddest bitches they know us
after the show they blow us and do all type of shit for us
now i can speak for me cause me everywhere i be
niggas know im a g got it locked got the keys
we moving bundles of d sippin on hennessy
buck rollin the trees banks countin the cheese

verse 3 young buck
im out on bond but the forty still on me
bouncin round like lil jon thinkin bout my dead homies
watch i hit need a lick and gon get me a brick
i keep on losin shootin dice and im sick of this shit
clientele still poppin so the junkies keep comin
and my neighbors is watchin but we still gettin money
on this block till the sun drop i dont have a home
i will not stop sellin rocks thug till im gone
got a couple old schools and some iced out jewels
some gunit shoes body full of tatooes
bout to stomp me a bitch put the pump to his lips
tell him talk that shit now yall wanna trip
i keep it dirty on the east coast dirty on the west
just a dirty lil nigga with a glock and a vest
banks tell me you dont like em and you know what ima do nigga
