and when you give me your clothes
and when were lovers at last
fresh air perfume in your nose

there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass

and when you give me your house
when were all brothers at last
there will be food in our mouths

chorus
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass
there will be teeth in the grass

when were all brilliant and fast
when all tomorrows are gone
