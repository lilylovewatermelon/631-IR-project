0kfTOGpi5eZCBxcRF5LFIh,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together - Commentary,Taylor Swift,4jTYApZPMapg56gRycOn0D,"5 contributorsoctober 2019 cover taylor swift lyricstaylor swift bursts into her mom’s nashville kitchen smiling looking remarkably like taylor swift that redlip classic thing check “i need someone to help dye my hair pink” she says and moments later her ends match her sparkly nail polish sneakers and the stripes on her buttondown it’s all in keeping with the pastel aesthetic of her new album lover blackleather combattaylor from her previous album cycle has handed back the phone around the blackgranite kitchen island all is calm and normal as swift’s mom dad and younger brother pass through her mom’s two dogs one very small one very large pounce upon visitors with slurping glee it could be any 29yearold’s weekend visit with her parents if not for the madness looming a few feet down the hall

in an airy terrace 113 giddy weepy shaky stillindisbelief fans are waiting for the start of one of swift’s secret sessions sacred rituals in swiftdom she’s about to play them her seventh album asyet unreleased on this sunday afternoon in early august and offer copious commentary also she made cookies just before the session swift sits down in her mom’s study where she “operates the google” per her daughter to chat for a few minutes the blackwalled room is decorated with blackandwhite classicrock photos including shots of bruce springsteen and unsurprisingly james taylor there are also more recent shots of swift posing with kris kristofferson and playing with def leppard her mom’s favorite band

in a corner is an acoustic guitar swift played as a teenager she almost certainly wrote some wellknown songs on it but can’t recall which ones “it would be kind of weird to finish a song and be like ‘and this moment i shall remember’” she says laughing “‘this guitar hath been anointed with my sacred tuneage”

the secret session itself is as the name suggests deeply offtherecord it can be confirmed that she drank some white wine since her glass pops up in some instagram pictures she stays until 5 am chatting and taking photos with every one of the fans five hours later we continue our talk at length in swift’s nashville condo in almost exactly the same spot where we did one of our interviews for her 2012 rolling stone cover story she’s hardly changed its whimsical decor in the past seven years one of the few additions is a pool table replacing the couch where we sat last time so it’s an oldtaylor time capsule there’s still a huge bunny made of moss in one corner and a humansize birdcage in the living room though the view from the latter is now of generic new condo buildings instead of just distant green hills swift is barefoot now in paleblue jeans and a blue buttondown tied at the waist her hair is pulled back her makeup minimal

how to sum up the past three years of taylor swift in july 2016 after swift expressed discontent with kanye west’s “famous” kim kardashian did her best to destroy her unleashing clandestine recordings of a phone conversation between swift and west in the piecemeal audio swift can be heard agreeing to the line “…me and taylor might still have sex” we don’t hear her learning about the next lyric the one she says bothered her — “i made that bitch famous” — and as she’ll explain there’s more to her side of the story the backlash was well swift and overwhelming it still hasn’t altogether subsided later that year swift chose not to make an endorsement in the 2016 election which definitely didn’t help in the face of it all she made reputation — fierce witty almostindustrial pop offset by love songs of crystalline beauty — and had a wildly successful stadium tour somewhere in there she met her current boyfriend joe alwyn and judging by certain songs on lover the relationship is serious indeed

lover is swift’s most adult album a rebalancing of sound and persona that opens doors to the next decade of her career it’s also a welcome return to the sonic diversity of 2012’s red with tracks ranging from the st vincentassisted überbop “cruel summer” to the unbearably poignant countryfied “soon you’ll get better” with the dixie chicks and the “shake it off”worthy pep of “paper rings”

she wants to talk about the music of course but she is also ready to explain the past three years of her life in depth for the first time the conversation is often not a light one she’s built up more armor in the past few years but still has the opposite of a poker face — you can see every microemotion wash over her as she ponders a question her nose wrinkling in semiironic offense at the term “oldschool pop stars” her preposterously blue eyes glistening as she turns to darker subjects in her worst moments she says “you feel like you’re being completely pulled into a riptide so what are you going to do splash a lot or hold your breath and hope you somehow resurface and that’s what i did and it took three years sitting here doing an interview — the fact that we’ve done an interview before is the only reason i’m not in a full body sweat”

when we talked seven years ago everything was going so well for you and you were very worried that something would go wrong

yeah i kind of knew it would i felt like i was walking along the sidewalk knowing eventually the pavement was going to crumble and i was gonna fall through you can’t keep winning and have people like it people love “new” so much — they raise you up the flagpole and you’re waving at the top of the flagpole for a while and then they’re like “wait this new flag is what we actually love” they decide something you’re doing is incorrect that you’re not standing for what you should stand for you’re a bad example then if you keep making music and you survive and you keep connecting with people eventually they raise you a little bit up the flagpole again and then they take you back down and back up again and it happens to women more than it happens to men in music

it also happened to you a few times on a smaller scale didn’t it

i’ve had several upheavals in my career when i was 18 they were like “she doesn’t really write those songs” so my third album i wrote by myself as a reaction to that then they decided i was a serial dater — a boycrazy maneater — when i was 22 and so i didn’t date anyone for like two years and then they decided in 2016 that absolutely everything about me was wrong if i did something good it was for the wrong reasons if i did something brave i didn’t do it correctly if i stood up for myself i was throwing a tantrum and so i found myself in this endless mockery echo chamber it’s just like — i have a brother who’s two and a half years younger and we spent the first half of our lives trying to kill each other and the second half as best friends you know that game kids play i’d be like “mom can i have some water” and austin would be like “mom can i have some water” and i’m like “he’s copying me” and he’d be like “he’s copying me” always in a really obnoxious voice that sounds all twisted that’s what it felt like in 2016 so i decided to just say nothing it wasn’t really a decision it was completely involuntary

but you also had good things happen in your life at the same time — that’s part of reputation

the moments of my true story on that album are songs like “delicate” “new year’s day” “call it what you want” “dress” the onetwo punch baitandswitch of reputation is that it was actually a love story it was a love story in amongst chaos all the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside that was the battle raging on that i could see from the windows and then there was what was happening inside my world — my newly quiet cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time    it’s weird because in some of the worst times of my career and reputation dare i say i had some of the most beautiful times — in my quiet life that i chose to have and i had some of the most incredible memories with the friends i now knew cared about me even if everyone hated me the bad stuff was really significant and damaging but the good stuff will endure the good lessons — you realize that you can’t just show your life to people
meaning
i used to be like a golden retriever just walking up to everybody like wagging my tail “sure yeah of course what do you want to know what do you need” now i guess i have to be a little bit more like a fox

do your regrets on that extend to the way the “girl squad” thing was perceived

yeah i never would have imagined that people would have thought “this is a clique that wouldn’t have accepted me if i wanted to be in it” holy shit that hit me like a ton of bricks i was like “oh this did not go the way that i thought it was going to go” i thought it was going to be we can still stick together just like men are allowed to do the patriarchy allows men to have bro packs if you’re a male artist there’s an understanding that you have respect for your counterparts

whereas women are expected to be feuding with each other

it’s assumed that we hate each other even if we’re smiling and photographed together with our arms around each other it’s assumed there’s a knife in our pocket

how much of a danger was there of falling into that thought pattern yourself

the messaging is dangerous yes nobody is immune because we’re a product of what society and peer groups and now the internet tells us unless we learn differently from experience

you once sang about a star who “took the money and your dignity and got the hell out” in 2016 you wrote in your journal “this summer is the apocalypse” how close did you come to quitting altogether

i definitely thought about that a lot i thought about how words are my only way of making sense of the world and expressing myself — and now any words i say or write are being twisted against me people love a hate frenzy it’s like piranhas people had so much fun hating me and they didn’t really need very many reasons to do it i felt like the situation was pretty hopeless i wrote a lot of really aggressively bitter poems constantly i wrote a lot of think pieces that i knew i’d never publish about what it’s like to feel like you’re in a shame spiral and i couldn’t figure out how to learn from it because i wasn’t sure exactly what i did that was so wrong that was really hard for me because i cannot stand it when people can’t take criticism so i try to selfexamine and even though that’s really hard and hurts a lot sometimes i really try to understand where people are coming from when they don’t like me and i completely get why people wouldn’t like me because you know i’ve had my insecurities say those things — and things 1000 times worse

but some of your former critics have become your friends right

some of my best friendships came from people publicly criticizing me and then it opening up a conversation hayley kiyoko was doing an interview and she made an example about how i get away with singing about straight relationships and people don’t give me shit the way they give her shit for singing about girls — and it’s totally valid like ella — lorde — the first thing she ever said about me publicly was a criticism of my image or whatever but i can’t really respond to someone saying “you as a human being are fake” and if they say you’re playing the victim that completely undermines your ability to ever verbalize how you feel unless it’s positive so ok should i just smile all the time and never say anything hurts me because that’s really fake or should i be real about how i’m feeling and have valid legitimate responses to things that happened to me in my life but wait would that be playing the victim

how do you escape that mental trap

since i was 15 years old if people criticized me for something i changed it so you realize you might be this amalgamation of criticisms that were hurled at you and not an actual person who’s made any of these choices themselves and so i decided i needed to live a quiet life because a quiet personal life invites no discussion dissection and debate i didn’t realize i was inviting people to feel they had the right to sort of play my life like a video game
“the old taylor can’t come to the phone right now why because she’s dead” was funny — but how seriously should we take it

there’s a part of me that definitely is always going to be different i needed to grow up in many ways i needed to make boundaries to figure out what was mine and what was the public’s that old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with i think that’s gone but it was definitely just like a fun moment in the studio with me and jack antonoff where i wanted to play on the idea of a phone call — because that’s how all of this started a stupid phone call i shouldn’t have picked up

it would have been much easier if that’s what you’d just said
it would have been so so great if i would have just said that laughs

some of the lover iconography does suggest old taylor’s return though
i don’t think i’ve ever leaned into the old version of myself more creatively than i have on this album where it’s very very autobiographical but also moments of extreme catchiness and moments of extreme personal confession

did you do anything wrong from your perspective in dealing with that phone call is there anything you regret

the world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it because nothing ever just happens like that without some leadup some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch that was not just a singular event basically i got really sick of the dynamic between he and i and that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things

i started to feel like we reconnected which felt great for me — because all i ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me when someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — i just so badly wanted that respect from him and i hate that about myself that i was like “this guy who’s antagonizing me i just want his approval” but that’s where i was and so we’d go to dinner and stuff and i was so happy because he would say really nice things about my music it just felt like i was healing some childhood rejection or something from when i was 19 but the 2015 vmas come around he’s getting the vanguard award he called me up beforehand — i didn’t illegally record it so i can’t play it for you but he called me up maybe a week or so before the event and we had maybe over an hourlong conversation and he’s like “i really really would like for you to present this vanguard award to me this would mean so much to me” and went into all the reasons why it means so much because he can be so sweet he can be the sweetest and i was so stoked that he asked me that and so i wrote this speech up and then we get to the vmas and i make this speech and he screams “mtv got taylor swift up here to present me this award for ratings” his exact words “you know how many times they announced taylor was going to give me the award ’cause it got them more ratings” and i’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife and this chill ran through my body i realized he is so twofaced that he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes but then he wants to look cool get up in front of everyone and talk shit and i was so upset he wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room i wouldn’t go so then he sent this big big thing of flowers the next day to apologize and i was like “you know what i really don’t want us to be on bad terms again so whatever i’m just going to move past this” so when he gets on the phone with me and i was so touched that he would be respectful and like tell me about this one line in the song

the line being “   me and taylor might still have sex”

nods and i was like “ok good we’re back on good terms” and then when i heard the song i was like “i’m done with this if you want to be on bad terms let’s be on bad terms but just be real about it” and then he literally did the same thing to drake he gravely affected the trajectory of drake’s family and their lives it’s the same thing getting close to you earning your trust detonating you i really don’t want to talk about it anymore because i get worked up and i don’t want to just talk about negative shit all day but it’s the same thing go watch drake talk about what happened west denied any involvement in pushat’s revelation of drake’s child and apologized for sending “negative energy” toward drake

when did you get to the place that’s described on the opening track of lover “i forgot that you existed”

it was sometime on the reputation tour which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career that tour put me in the healthiest most balanced place i’ve ever been after that tour bad stuff can happen to me but it doesn’t level me anymore the stuff that happened a couple of months ago with scott borchetta would have leveled me three years ago and silenced me i would have been too afraid to speak up something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception i used to hang my entire identity on which i now know is incredibly unhealthy

what was the actual revelation
it’s almost like i feel more clear about the fact that my job is to be an entertainer it’s not like this massive thing that sometimes my brain makes it into and sometimes the media makes it into where we’re all on this battlefield and everyone’s gonna die except one person who wins it’s like “no do you know what katy is going to be legendary gaga is going to be legendary beyoncé is going to be legendary rihanna is going to be legendary because the work that they made completely overshadows the myopia of this 24hour news cycle of clickbait” and somehow i realized that on tour as i was looking at people’s faces we’re just entertaining people and it’s supposed to be fun

it’s interesting to look at these albums as a trilogy 1989 was really a reset button

oh in every way i’ve been very vocal about the fact that that decision was mine and mine alone and it was definitely met with a lot of resistance internally
after realizing that things were not all smiles with your former label boss scott borchetta it’s hard not to wonder how much additional conflict there was over things like that

a lot of the best things i ever did creatively were things that i had to really fight — and i mean aggressively fight — to have happen but you know i’m not like him making crazy petty accusations about the past    when you have a business relationship with someone for 15 years there are going to be a lot of ups and a lot of downs but i truly legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had and so even though we had a lot of really bad times and creative differences i was going to hang my hat on the good stuff i wanted to be friends with him i thought i knew what betrayal felt like but this stuff that happened with him was a redefinition of betrayal for me just because it felt like it was family to go from feeling like you’re being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of “oh i was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most”

he accused you of declining the parkland march and manchester benefit show

unbelievable here’s the thing everyone in my team knew if scooter braun brings us something do not bring it to me the fact that those two are in business together after the things he said about scooter braun — it’s really hard to shock me and this was utterly shocking these are two very rich very powerful men using 300 million of other people’s money to purchase like the most feminine body of work and then they’re standing in a woodpanel bar doing a tacky photo shoot raising a glass of scotch to themselves because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that i didn’t even see it coming and i couldn’t say anything about it

in some ways on a musical level lover feels like the most indieish of your albums

that’s amazing thank you it’s definitely a quirky record with this album i felt like i sort of gave myself permission to revisit older themes that i used to write about maybe look at them with fresh eyes and to revisit older instruments — older in terms of when i used to use them because when i was making 1989 i was so obsessed with it being this concept of eighties big pop whether it was eighties in its production or eighties in its nature just having these big choruses — being unapologetically big and then reputation there was a reason why i had it all in lowercase i felt like it wasn’t unapologetically commercial it’s weird because that is the album that took the most amount of explanation and yet it’s the one i didn’t talk about in the reputation secret sessions i kind of had to explain to my fans “i know we’re doing a new thing here that i’d never done before” i’d never played with characters before for a lot of pop stars that’s a really fun trick where they’re like “this is my alter ego” i had never played with that before it’s really fun and it was just so fun to play with on tour — the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotionalturmoil record

“daylight” is a beautiful song it feels like it could have been the title track

it almost was i thought it might be a little bit too sentimental

and i guess maybe too onthenose

right yeah way too onthenose that’s what i thought because i was kind of in my head referring to the album as daylight for a while but lover to me was a more interesting title more of an accurate theme in my head and more elastic as a concept that’s why “you need to calm down” can make sense within the theme of the album — one of the things it addresses is how certain people are not allowed to live their lives without discrimination just based on who they love
for the more organic songs on this album like “lover” and “paper rings” you said you were imagining a wedding band playing them how often does that kind of visualization shape a song’s production style

sometimes i’ll have a strange sort of fantasy of where the songs would be played and so for songs like “paper rings” or “lover” i was imagining a weddingreception band but in the seventies so they couldn’t play instruments that wouldn’t have been invented yet i have all these visuals for reputation it was nighttime cityscape i didn’t really want any — or very minimal — traditional acoustic instruments i imagined old warehouse buildings that had been deserted and factory spaces and all this industrial kind of imagery so i wanted the production to have nothing wooden there’s no wood floors on that album lover is like completely just a barn wood floor and some ripped curtains flowing in the breeze and fields of flowers and you know velvet

how did you come to use high school metaphors to touch on politics with “miss americana  the heartbreak prince”

there are so many influences that go into that particular song i wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections and i wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist and so i was thinking about a traditional american high school where there’s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated and i think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better

i feel like your fall out boy fandom might’ve slipped out in that title

i love fall out boy so much their songwriting really influenced me lyrically maybe more than anyone else they take a phrase and they twist it “loaded god complexcock it and pull it” when i heard that i was like “i’m dreaming”

you sing about “american stories burning before me” do you mean the illusions of what america is

it’s about the illusions of what i thought america was before our political landscape took this turn and that naivete that we used to have about it and it’s also the idea of people who live in america who just want to live their lives make a living have a family love who they love and watching those people lose their rights or watching those people feel not at home in their home i have that line “i see the highfives between the bad guys” because not only are some really racist horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly and it’s horrific

you’re in this weird place of being a blond blueeyed pop star in this era — to the point where until you endorsed some democratic candidates rightwingers and worse assumed you were on their side

i don’t think they do anymore yeah that was jarring and i didn’t hear about that until after it had happened because at this point i for a very long time i didn’t have the internet on my phone and my team and my family were really worried about me because i was not in a good place and there was a lot of stuff that they just dealt with without telling me about it which is the only time that’s ever happened in my career i’m always in the pilot seat trying to fly the plane that is my career in exactly the direction i want to take it but there was a time when i just had to throw my hands up and say “guys i can’t i can’t do this i need you to just take over for me and i’m just going to disappear”

are you referring to when a whitesupremacist site suggested you were on their team

i didn’t even see that but like if that happened that’s just disgusting there’s literally nothing worse than white supremacy it’s repulsive there should be no place for it really i keep trying to learn as much as i can about politics and it’s become something i’m now obsessed with whereas before i was living in this sort of political ambivalence because the person i voted for had always won we were in such an amazing time when obama was president because foreign nations respected us we were so excited to have this dignified person in the white house my first election was voting for him when he made it into office and then voting to reelect him i think a lot of people are like me where they just didn’t really know that this could happen but i’m just focused on the 2020 election i’m really focused on it i’m really focused on how i can help and not hinder because i also don’t want it to backfire again because i do feel that the celebrity involvement with hillary’s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways

you took a lot of heat for not getting involved does any part of you regret that you just didn’t say “fuck it” and gotten more specific when you said to vote that november

totally yeah i regret a lot of things all the time it’s like a daily ritual

were you just convinced that it would backfire

that’s literally what it was yeah it’s a very powerful thing when you legitimately feel like numbers have proven that pretty much everyone hates you like quantifiably that’s not me being dramatic and you know that

there were a lot of people in those stadiums

it’s true but that was two years later    i do think as a party we need to be more of a team with republicans if you’re wearing that red hat you’re one of them and if we’re going to do anything to change what’s happening we need to stick together we need to stop dissecting why someone’s on our side or if they’re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly we need to not have the right kind of democrat and the wrong kind of democrat we need to just be like “you’re a democrat sick get in the car we’re going to the mall”

here’s a hard question for you as a superfan what did you think of the game of thrones finale

oh my god i’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this so clinically our brain responds to our favorite show ending the same way we feel when a breakup occurs i read that there’s no good way for it to end no matter what would have happened in that finale people still would have been really upset because of the fact that it’s over

i was glad to see you confirm that your line about a “list of names” was a reference to arya

i like to be influenced by movies and shows and books and stuff i love to write about a character dynamic and not all of my life is going to be as kind of complex as these intricate webs of characters on tv shows and movies

there was a time when it was

that’s amazing

but is the idea that as your own life becomes less dramatic you’ll need to pull ideas from other places

i don’t feel like that yet i think i might feel like that possibly when i have a family if i have a family pauses i don’t know why i said that but that’s what i’ve heard from other artists that they were very protective of their personal life so they had to draw inspiration from other things but again i don’t know why i said that because i don’t know how my life is going to go or what i’m going to do but right now i feel like it’s easier for me to write than it ever was

you don’t talk about your relationship but you’ll sing about it in wildly revealing detail what’s the difference for you

singing about something helps you to express it in a way that feels more accurate you cannot no matter what put words in a quote and have it move someone the same way as if you heard those words with the perfect sonic representation of that feeling    there is that weird conflict in being a confessional songwriter and then also having my life you know 10 years ago be catapulted into this strange popculture thing

i’ve heard you say that people got too interested in which song was about who which i can understand — at the same time to be fair it was a game you played into wasn’t it
i realized very early on that no matter what that was going to happen to me regardless so when you realize the rules of the game you’re playing and how it will affect you you got to look at the board and make your strategy but at the same time writing songs has never been a strategic element of my career but i’m not scared anymore to say that other things in my career like how to market an album are strictly strategic and i’m sick of women not being able to say that they have strategic business minds — because male artists are allowed to and so i’m sick and tired of having to pretend like i don’t mastermind my own business but it’s a different part of my brain than i use to write

you’ve been masterminding your business since you were a teenager

yeah but i’ve also tried very hard — and this is one thing i regret — to convince people that i wasn’t the one holding the puppet strings of my marketing existence or the fact that i sit in a conference room several times a week and come up with these ideas i felt for a very long time that people don’t want to think of a woman in music who isn’t just a happy talented accident we’re all forced to kind of be like “aw shucks this happened again we’re still doing well aw that’s so great” alex morgan celebrating scoring a goal at the world cup and getting shit for it is a perfect example of why we’re not allowed to flaunt or celebrate or reveal that like “oh yeah it was me i came up with this stuff” i think it’s really unfair people love new female artists so much because they’re able to explain that woman’s success there’s an easy trajectory look at the game of thrones finale i specifically really related to daenerys’ storyline because for me it portrayed that it is a lot easier for a woman to attain power than to maintain it

i mean she did murder   

it’s a total metaphor like obviously i didn’t want daenerys to become that kind of character but in taking away what i chose to take away from it i thought maybe they’re trying to portray her climbing the ladder to the top was a lot easier than maintaining it because for me the times when i felt like i was going insane was when i was trying to maintain my career in the same way that i ascended it’s easier to get power than to keep it it’s easier to get acclaim than to keep it it’s easier to get attention than to keep it

well i guess we should be glad you didn’t have a dragon in 2016   

fiercely i told you i don’t like that she did that but i mean watching the show though maybe this is a reflection on how we treat women in power how we are totally going to conspire against them and tear at them until they feel this — this insane shift where you wonder like “what changed” and i’ve had that happen like 60 times in my career where i’m like “ok you liked me last year what changed i guess i’ll change so i can keep entertaining you guys”
you once said that your mom could never punish you when you were little because you’d punish yourself this idea of changing in the face of criticism and needing approval — that’s all part of wanting to be good right whatever that means but that seems to be a real driving force in your life

yeah that’s definitely very perceptive of you and the question posed to me is if you kept trying to do good things but everyone saw those things in a cynical way and assumed them to be done with bad motivation and bad intent would you still do good things even though nothing that you did was looked at as good and the answer is yes criticism that’s constructive is helpful to my character growth baseless criticism is stuff i’ve got to toss out now

that sounds healthy is this therapy talking or is this just experience

no i’ve never been to therapy i talk to my mom a lot because my mom is the one who’s seen everything god it takes so long to download somebody on the last 29 years of my life and my mom has seen it all she knows exactly where i’m coming from and we talk endlessly there were times when i used to have really really really bad days where we would just be on the phone for hours and hours and hours i’d write something that i wanted to say and instead of posting it i’d just read it to her

i somehow connect all this to the lyric in “daylight” the idea of “so many lines that i’ve crossed unforgiven” — it’s a different kind of confession

i am really glad you liked that line because that’s something that does bother me looking back at life and realizing that no matter what you screw things up sometimes there are people that were in your life and they’re not anymore — and there’s nothing you can do about it you can’t fix it you can’t change it i told the fans last night that sometimes on my bad days i feel like my life is a pile of crap accumulated of only the bad headlines or the bad things that have happened or the mistakes i’ve made or clichés or rumors or things that people think about me or have thought for the last 15 years and that was part of the “look what you made me do” music video where i had a pile of literal old selves fighting each other

but yeah that line is indicative of my anxiety about how in life you can’t get everything right a lot of times you make the wrong call make the wrong decision say the wrong thing hurt people even if you didn’t mean to you don’t really know how to fix all of that when it’s like 29 years’ worth

to be mr “rolling stone” for a second there’s a springsteen lyric “ain’t no one leaving this world buddywithout their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody”

that’s really good no one gets through it unscathed no one gets through in one piece i think that’s a hard thing for a lot of people to grasp i know it was hard for me because i kind of grew up thinking “if i’m nice and if i try to do the right thing you know maybe i can just like ace this whole thing” and it turns out i can’t

it’s interesting to look at “i did something bad” in this context

you pointing that out is really interesting because it’s something i’ve had to reconcile within myself in the last couple of years — that sort of “good” complex because from the time i was a kid i’d try to be kind be a good person try really hard but you get walked all over sometimes and how do you respond to being walked all over you can’t just sit there and eat your salad and let it happen “i did something bad” was about doing something that was so against what i would usually do katy perry and i were talking about our signs    laughs of course we were

that’s the greatest sentence ever

laughs i hate you we were talking about our signs because we had this really really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff and i remember in the long talk she was like “if we had one glass of white wine right now we’d both be crying” because we were drinking tea we’ve had some really good conversations

we were talking about how we’ve had miscommunications with people in the past not even specifically with each other she’s like “i’m a scorpio scorpios just strike when they feel threatened” and i was like “well i’m an archer we literally stand back assess the situation process how we feel about it raise a bow pull it back and fire” so it’s completely different ways of processing pain confusion misconception and oftentimes i’ve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me do you know what i mean and so i can understand how people in my life would have been like “whoa i didn’t know that was how you felt” because it takes me a second

if you watch the video of the 2009 vmas i literally freeze i literally stand there and that is how i handle any discomfort any pain i stand there i freeze and then five minutes later i know how i feel but in the moment i’m probably overreacting and i should be nice then i process it and in five minutes if it’s gone it’s past and i’m like “i was overreacting everything’s fine i can get through this i’m glad i didn’t say anything harsh in the moment” but when it’s actually something bad that happened and i feel really really hurt or upset about it i only know after the fact because i’ve tried so hard to squash it “this probably isn’t what you think” that’s something i had to work on

you could end up gaslighting yourself

yeah for sure ’cause so many situations where if i would have said the first thing that came to my mind people would have been like “whoa” and maybe i would have been wrong or combative so a couple of years ago i started working on actually just responding to my emotions in a quicker fashion and it’s really helped with stuff it’s helped so much because sometimes you get in arguments but conflict in the moment is so much better than combat after the fact

well thanks

i do feel like i just did a therapy session as someone who’s never been to therapy i can safely say that was the best therapy sessionembed"
