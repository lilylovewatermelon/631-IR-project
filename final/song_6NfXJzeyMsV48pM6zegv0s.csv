i am a man of constant sorrow
ive seen trouble all my days
i bid farewell to old kentucky
the place where i was born and raised
the place where he was born and raised

for six long years ive been in trouble
no pleasure here on earth i found
for in this world im bound to ramble
i have no friends to help me now
he has no friends to help him now

its fare thee well my old true lover
i never expect to see you again
for im bound to ride that northern railroad
perhaps ill die upon this train
perhaps hell die upon this train

you can bury me in some deep valley
for many years where i may lay
then you may learn to love another
while i am sleeping in my grave
while he is sleeping in his grave
you might also likemaybe your friends think im just a stranger
my face you never will see no more
but there is one promise that is given
ill meet you on gods golden shore
hell meet you on gods golden shoreembed"
