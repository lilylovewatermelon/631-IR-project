this is bad
this is real

now i see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
strength of rastafari im hoping someday maybe
they dont obey their parents maybe they will obey me
future for the babies hopes for the babies
tomorrow for the babies no sorrow for the babies
babies having babies raising our babies
all of these young ladies give them thanks and praises
how long can she take it
dreams are full of maybes will she ever make it
hustles on a daily in the club a shake it
strip down til she naked dont ever mistake it
much too real to fake it need it then shell take it
shell do it for the babies a mothers love is sacred
now you dont ever fail me
a woman needs caring sharing love all the time no dont you ever fail me
a child needs loving caring…

is there no other option than adoption for you babies
youre raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
strength of rastafari im hoping someday maybe
they dont obey their parents maybe they will obey me
cowards play the game thing fathers do the brave thing
and thats participating
he keeps on concentrating
there is no debating
no running away thing
a new life is awakening
from his ejaculating
its in the oven baking
takes two for the making
hes right there through the cravings
and early morning waking
school and educating
sports and recreating karate and ballet thing
teenager of today thing
fathers still relating still communicating
and theyll always embrace him
cause they cannot replace him
see damian marley liveget tickets as low as 50a woman needs caring sharing love all the time no dont you ever fail me
cause they cannot replace him
a child needs loving caring…

and always do your best to keep a promise to your babies
and if you cant be good at least be honest to your babies
the strength of rastafari im hoping someday maybe
they dont obey their parents maybe they will obey me
history of the babies
beginning of the ages
youre flipping through the pages
and up and through the 80s
some are gang related drug affiliated
some intoxicated
headed for the snake pit
and papas locked in cages
and mamas lacking wages
and this is what theyre faced with
upon a daily basis
bleaching out dem faces
running from dem races
shooting up dem places
killing other babies
as bitter as the taste is
and words cannot explain it
just walk the narrow pavement
and speak of love not hatred1embed"
