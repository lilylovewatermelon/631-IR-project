hold up po me up yes
double the cup just to cut the stress in half
guess who the fuck left
after all is said and done regret the past
best move along got a long way to go ayy
i dont know i dont know i dont know aye

verse 1 norman atomic
shawty i dont mind but youre always on my mind
think about you all the time think about you all the time
where the fuck was i when this relationship dried
i was probably high to realize you left my side
i will finally give out and die finally give out and die
i would love it if you bring me flowers if you come by
if you come around

chorus anthony mars
uicide been on my mind
pour my heart on the concrete every fucking time
each time you left it feels like you died
depressed and i dont wanna go on any longer

verse 2 anthony mars
delusions keep me going
illusions keep me hoping
parachute woven from broken down
men are from mars but theres nothing but cold
grow up all alone
no fam no home
so i do drugs just to numb up
yeah i do drugs when i wanna
back off the xans five in the morning
aint tryna come down
aint tryna be sober

pour my heart on the concrete every fucking time68embed"
