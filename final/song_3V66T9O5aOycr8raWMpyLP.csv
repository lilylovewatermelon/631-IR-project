lets sit around and drink some saké
then we can argue bout the same things
talk about neighbors on our front porch
i wonder if they know were moving
hope they dont know my landlord personally
cause i never told him you moved in with me
but fuck him he kept my money

verse 2
i think your sisters are so pretty
got drunk and they forgot they met me
i made her laugh one time at dinner
she said im funny and then i thanked her
but i know im funny haha

verse 3
we go through phases when were over ours
right now we both wanna be rockstars
got you a bass last year on your birthday
the same one the guy from linkin park plays
but you look better with it anywayssee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 49you might also like3embed"
