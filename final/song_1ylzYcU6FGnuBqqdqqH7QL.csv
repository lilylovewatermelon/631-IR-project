life is my friend rake it up to take it in
wrap me in your cinnamon especially in michigan
well i could be your friend
white clouds im in a mitten full of fisherman
cmon huckleberry finn show me how to make her grin
well im in michigan

prechorus anthony kiedis
cry me a future where the revelations run amok
ladies and gentlemen
lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
uhuck uhuck

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
a rainy lithuanian whos dancing as an indian
painted in my tiger skin especially in michigan
double chins and bowling pins unholy presbyterians
land is full of medicine i find it when im slipping in
the tainted new librarian who fainted when she tucked you in
well im in michigan
lets float away like zeppelins on stoic gusts of northern wind

bridge anthony kiedis
cry me a future where the revelations run amok
ladies and gentlemen
lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
uhuck uhuck
out on the farm well be swimming with the mother duck
deep in the mitten
where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
uhuck uhuck

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
life is my friend underwater violins
order now from ho chi min a porcelain that comes in twins
throw me in the loony bin cause i can take it on the chin
when i’m in michigan
the cleavage of your pillow skin is moving like a violin

postchorus anthony kiedis
cry me a future where the revelations run amok
ladies and gentlemen
lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
uhuck uhuck

outro anthony kiedis
out on the farm well be swimming with the mother duck
deep in the mitten
where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
uhuck uhuck
