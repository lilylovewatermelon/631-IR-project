here we are at the end
say goodbye to all your friends
here we go watching the sun go round
sitting on a rooftop making time stop
i never want to come back down
never want to come down

chorus
its the end of the summer
its the end of it all
those days are gone
its over now
were moving on
its the end of the summer
but well see it all again
so hold on to this moment till then
its the end of the summer

verse 2
here we stand in the middle of an empty street
tell me where you want to go
ill tell you thats where i want to be
say goodbye to the warm breeze
we could be almost anywhere
ill miss you till the next time
i hope i see you there
i hope i see you back here

its the end of the summer
its the end of it all
those days are gone
its over now
were moving on
its the end of the summer
but well see it all again
so hold on to this moment till then
its the end of the summer

bridge
rides almost over
its getting colder
take one last look
before it passes by
before it passes you by

chorus
its the end of the summer
its the end of it all
those days are gone
its over now
were moving on
its the end of the summer
but well see it all again
