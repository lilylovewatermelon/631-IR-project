im too much or not enough
maybe everyone else is messed up
well anyway i cant seem to
stay in just one state of mind
waiting round for something better
im the one that wouldnt let her
now im back and forth
i get bored when shes no perfect find

chorus
cause its one thing or another
i dont even know why i bother
one thing just tears her down
cause its one thing or another
i dont even know why i bother
something i just cant get around

verse 2
consider the possibility that
youve been had but not by me
were just kids dont worry about this
my course is run and im so tired
until the next one comes inspired
i feel bad and i should
i made her sad and i knew it would

cause its one thing or another
i dont even know why i bother
one thing just tears her down
cause its one thing or another
i dont even know why i bother
something i just cant get around

i need to learn to wait in turn
cause now i just step blindly
and im only happy when
i can close my eyes and i just dive in
and forget about acting kindly
