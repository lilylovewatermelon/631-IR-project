as i’m getting older chip up on my shoulder
rolling through life to roll over and die
scat singing
missing hippie jon salad days are gone
remembering things just to tell ‘em so long
scat singing

chorus
oh mama actin’ like my life’s already over
oh dear act your age and try another year

verse 2
always feeling tired smiling when required
write another year off and kindly resign
scat singing
salad days are gone missing hippie jon
remember the days just to tell ‘em so long
scat singing

chorus
oh mama actin’ like my life’s already over
oh dear act your age and try another year
oh mama actin’ like my life’s already over
oh dear act your age and try another yearyou might also like33embed"
