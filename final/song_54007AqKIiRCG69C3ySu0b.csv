her daddy gave her her first pony
then taught her to ride
she climbed high in that saddle
fell i dont know how many times
he taught her a lesson that she learned
maybe a little too well

chorus
cowgirls dont cry
ride baby ride
lessons in life are going to show you in time
soon enough youre going to know why
its going to hurt every now and then
if you fall get back on again
cowgirls dont cry

verse 2
she grew up
she got married
never was quite right
she wanted a house a home and babies
he started coming home late at night
she didnt let him see it break her heart
she didnt let him see her fall apart

cowgirls dont cry
ride baby ride
lessons in life are going to show you in time
soon enough youre going to know why
its going to hurt every now and then
if you fall get back on again
cowgirls dont cry

verse 3
phone rang early one morning
her mommas voice shed been crying
said its your daddy you need to come home
this is it i think hes dying
she laid the phone down by his head
the last words that he said
