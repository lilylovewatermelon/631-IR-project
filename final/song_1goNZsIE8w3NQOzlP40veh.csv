verse 2
hate it when you tease
where you think youre goin when you comin back to me
you walked in im listening to stan on e yeah ecstasy
matter of fact theres a bridge that my car wants to meet
road trip on me itll be fun youll see
but you dont gotta sit in this trunk you can sit next to me
for me and stan we alike but he aint nicer than me
he was drunk drivin me im just straight percules

outro
my crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
as we hit the bridge thats just the start
not afraid to die as you can see
life isnt real loves makebelieve
my crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
as we hit the bridge thats just the start
not afraid to die as you can see
life isnt real loves makebelieve44embed"
