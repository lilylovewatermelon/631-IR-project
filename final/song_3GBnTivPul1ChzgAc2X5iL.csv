so may i have your attention
look in my direction
here you will see the sun never sets
no we do not have to worry
never in a hurry
onebyone the stars go to bed
and ill step into the spotlight again

chorus
can’t help myself
i’ve gotta be where the lights are shining down on me
i wanna feel the sun
so turn that walk into a run
gonna bring the party when i come
sing it out if you want to have some fun
and into the spotlight we will go
follow me cause baby life’s a show
into the spotlight
you will see it’s the only place to be chachacha

verse 2
oh the music’s like a magnet
the best thing on the planet
it’s pulling us together again
so let’s cause a commotion
soundwaves on the ocean
wake the moon and grab your best friend
let’s step into the spotlight again

turn it up if your downhearted
let the music get us started
gotta let it go once in a while
turn it up there’s nothing to it
when it’s done well just redo it
might as well have fun have fun in this life
