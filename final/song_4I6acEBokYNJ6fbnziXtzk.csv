and i stay awake just to fight
its so surreal there is no way out of here
im caught on both sides and this i know is clear
i dont know where you are
so why do i care
i know were both even
so whys it feel unfair
cuz ive been the one who stood by you
and ive been the one who waited in line
and gave up his time for you
and ive been the one youve soon forgotten
but you never seemed to care
no you never seemed to care
sometimes the bad and the good blend together
an open book is as predictable as the weather
and there are no new ways to reinvent this life
and there are no instructions on how to make it right
i dont know where you are
so why do i care
i know were both even
so whys it feel unfair
cuz ive been the one who stood by you
and ive been the one who waited in line
and gave up his time for you
and ive been the one youve soon forgotten
so youre covered still i wished you well
so you struggled sometimes we all need help
i know youll find yourself sooner or later
recover and just move on
cuz ive been the one who stood by you
and ive been the one who waited in line
and gave up his time for you
and ive been the one youve soon forgotten
