would you walk to the edge of the ocean
just to fill my jar with sand
just in case i get the notion
to let it run through my hand
let it run through my hand

chorus
well i dont want the whole world
the sun the moon and all their light
i just want to be the only girl
you love all your life
you love all your life

verse 2
would you catch a couple thousand fireflies
yeah and put them in a lamp to light my world
all dressed up in a tux and bow tie
hand delivered to a lonely girl
to a lonely lonely girl

chorus
well i dont want the whole world
the sun the moon and all their light
i just want to be the only girl
you love all your life
you love all your life

lately ive been writing desperate love songs
i mostly sing them to the wall
you could be the center piece of my obsession
if you would notice me at all yeah

chorus
well i dont want the whole world
the sun the moon and all their light
i just want to be the only girl
you love all your life
you love all your life

outro
you love all your life
