she really had me turnin on
i fought for hours just to try and speak
tell my babe i was the only one
dont you know how it feels
to live days and months and years
trapped inside a waking dream
i betcha you and i could step out tonight and try
to make it more than just a fantasy

we are fast youth going nowhere
burning this town like we dont care
nothing you say could ever put out our fire

we can pretend pretend for the weekend
we can pretend pretend for the weekend
outside the nights as young as us
tonight is just the two of us
pretend pretend for the weekend

i found my love it was just last week
she was smooth with her heart glasses on
i felt the fire fire was in my feet
lets be together now while were still young
baby dont you know how it feels
to live days and months and years
trapped inside a waking dream
i betcha you and i could step out tonight and try
to make it more than just a fantasy
you might also likewe are fast youth going nowhere
burning this town like we dont care
nothing you say could ever put out our fire

we can pretend pretend for the weekend
we can pretend pretend for the weekend
outside the nights as young as us
tonight its just the two of us
pretend pretend for the weekend

we are the ones that put on the show
i am the one that never let go
im never alone when im around you around you

we can pretend pretend for the weekend
we can pretend pretend for the weekend

nobody knows me like you
nobody knows me like you
we got a lot to get through
nobody knows me
nobody knows

outside the nights as young as us
tonight its just the two of us
pretend pretend for the weekendembed"
