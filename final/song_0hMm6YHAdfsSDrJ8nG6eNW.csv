in the world i be in
let the bandplay

verse 1
i guess you wonder where ive been
im searchin to find a love within
how you gon love me i dont love myself
all night flights im neglectin my health
im totin hammers chasin after death
said i was vibin this time
i got a thing for you baby i dont know what it is
everybody love to hate me i dont know what i did
ride on my face baby sit on my lip
i got yo water runnin mhmmhm
i want you to conceive my kid pee on this stick
i think i did me somethin last time i was here
im so committed i would die for what i live for
some people may not ever find what they dreamed of
so loyal for you ill go dive in the deep end
sometimes might even compromise what i believe in

chorus
i miss my brother cool im out here by myself it got me vulnerable
and i done been betrayed dont even care to hide it crossed me in my face
fucked over so much times it feels weird somebody keeps it real
youll switch on anything and anybody dawg if you aint ridin for this

i gave you all the game i gave you all the information to hurt me
sat down and taught you all the ways for you to hurt me
killin my liver with the liquor and the perkys
thanks for the losses and the gains on this journey
wanna kill my niggas but i really wanted help from em
i got some things buried i still aint never healed from it
you fooled me once you cant get the good me a second way
matter fact i lost track of myself in the first place

chorus
i miss my brother cool im out here by myself it got me vulnerable
im walkin round with my hands out beggin for love
i need anybody
god know peace and nothings private
i cant do nothin private
i miss my brother cool im out here by myself it got me vulnerable
you left me in the cold with nobody to warn me
nobody understood me cause nobody know me
came back to let you know that even though you hurt me i cant let you go2embed"
