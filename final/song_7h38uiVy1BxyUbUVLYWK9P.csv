idlest delilah
darling do ya like beige in your coffee tea a wild
wild breeze on a day a dawn
oft indeed a child smiles at me cause im made of yarn
dolly me am i ill trade a dollar for ya dime oh
idlest delilah
trout and trees remind me of my
darling d the diver
diver d was a satyr  a
father figurine
i made him run away with his stale lung
folly me am i oh idolless delilah
darling miss delilah
while youre wasting your days alone
all your friends are hired all your friendships are fading
dont try to cheat the dial dont look the other way
it could play out wrong
are you suicidal
are you in denial
idlest delilah
while youre wake hear my latest song
glad to see you smile
glad to see you so stable
whats all of these divided by the pile of peas on the nape of your
dolly me am i ill trade a dollar for your dime
ill take you
