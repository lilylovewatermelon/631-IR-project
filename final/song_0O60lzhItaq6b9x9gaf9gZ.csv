i know sometimes you need me to be tender
i dont give you much to go on
so im amazed at how you hold on to me
baby girl ive never been this close before
never opened up that door
im still finding my way

verse 2
something else that lovers do
when ive been by myself
never had to talk about
moving in with someone else

chorus
then you kiss my face
and it makes me smile
girl i want to lay with you
right here with you
for a little while
when i feel that rush
coming down all over me
youre as fas as i can see
thats tender as i wanna be
tender as i wanna be
girl its so tender

no maybe its that hard
to find someone to please me
or it could be that real true love
sometimes dont come easy
no it dont come easy

chorus
then you kiss my face
and it makes me smile
girl i want to lay with you
right here with you
for a little while
when i feel that rush
coming down all over me
youre as fas as i can see
thats tender as i wanna be
tender as i wanna be
girl its so tenderembed"
