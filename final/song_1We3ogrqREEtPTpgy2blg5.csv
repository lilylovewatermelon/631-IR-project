waking up to another life
no more sorrow and no more night
youre the light let it shine now let it shine now
burning bright cause were not ashamed
got a world to illuminate

shadows fade as you now arise
hope is here with no end in sight
youre the light let it shine now let it shine now

chorus
nothing can stand against us

we declare your kingdoms here
because our god is for us
were living in the promise
