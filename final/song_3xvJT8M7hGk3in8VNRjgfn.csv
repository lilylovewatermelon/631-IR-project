don’t make me feel this way
not right now
but i can see it in your face
and i can tell you
what you mean to me
but i’m afraid to
cause you might not agree
and i imagine that you heard
cause i don’t want to be the one to tell it first
oh i i i
oh i i i
i’ve never seen you like this
oh i i i
oh i i i
wanna give you one last kiss
oh see
things from my perspective
in many ways
it was my first time too
so don’t hate me
cause i’m that fool
i never meant to
be that cruel
and i imagine what you think
i prey to god that your
heart doesn’t sting
i don’t really wanna make things worse
this is the only way
i can keep from bursting
i wish you could see me
why don’t you look at me
i can’t call you on the phone
it’s been this long
and we’re so remote
so behave babe
i know your just fine
you haven’t escaped me
cause in this world i’m blindyou might also likeembed"
