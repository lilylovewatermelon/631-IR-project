verse drake  french montana
if you need me you can call me i stay busy makin money
you know what is on my mind all i think about is hunnids
i stay busy bzz workin on me
i stay busy with my business homie
i already hit her when you left her lonely
she is not the type that likes to take things slowly
slowly my mouth is goin off i dont know patience
i got a chance then my niggas got it too like its contagious
i see the future when i get wavy wavy god
but i couldnt picture bein champagne haan when i would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
i couldnt picture changes
when i was with ms creighton that lady hates me
couldnt picture wifin braden when i was pumpin gas on road trips to go from cincinnati on to dayton
i couldnt gauge it
i wanna thank god for workin way harder than satan
hes playin favourites it feels amazin yeah
