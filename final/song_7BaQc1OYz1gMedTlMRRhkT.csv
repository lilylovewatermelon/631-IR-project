i’ve been avoiding the void
but i can’t see the point
were you talkin to me
oh my eyes were closed i’m sorry

verse 2
when you talk in your sleep
you draw me out from underneath me
take your hand in my hand
bloodbrother ampersand

bridge
and the blood will flow
in the morning when my thoughts are flowing also
you only know what you notice
and no you don’t know me
if you’re askin how could i know
then you don’t know me or if i want it bad enough
with broken branches in your eyelids
and your iris a violent violet

outro
if you could see me now
