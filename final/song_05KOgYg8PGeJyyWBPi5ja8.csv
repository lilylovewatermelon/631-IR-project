is it the strength of your feelings
overthrowing your pain
youll see new heights you’ll be reaching
and is it today that you will find your new release
and in your wake ripple your sweet fate
and more chune for your headtop
so watch how you speak on my name you know

verse 1 drake
yeah i couldnt get a bill paid
you couldnt buy the real thing
i was stayin’ up at yo place
tryin to figure out the whole thing
i saw people doin things
almost gave up on the music thing
but we all so spoiled now
more life more everything
must have never had your phone tapped
all that yappin on the phone shit
you must really love the road life
all that never comin home shit
