they were hotter than hell
and ive been long gone couldnt you tell

the smoke in the air
couldnt hide my shame
saw it lit up on that silver screen

and ahh that fullbellied moon shes ashinin on me
yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea

and you came on strong like some running wave
and your beauty left me broke and hungry
left me begging to the birds for a bone or an offering
left me saying nothin nothin like i always say

and ahh that fullbellied moon shes ashinin on me
yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea

and those brokenhearted lovers
they got nothing on mesee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like1embed"
