cold is the water
it freezes your already cold mind
already cold cold mind
and death is at your doorstep
and it will steal your innocence
but it will not steal your substance

chorus
but you are not alone in this
and you are not alone in this
as brothers we will stand and well hold your hand
hold your hand

verse 2
and you are the mother
the mother of your baby child
the one to whom you gave life
and you have your choices
and these are what make man great
his ladder to the stars

chorus
but you are not alone in this
and you are not alone in this
as brothers we will stand and well hold your hand
hold your hand
you might also likeoutro
and i will tell the night
whisper lose your sight
but i cant move the mountains
for you8embed"
