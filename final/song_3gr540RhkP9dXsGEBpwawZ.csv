stuck to the dog pissin out both ends
i got a hundred lethal weapons that i call my friends
aint a person on earth who could take my life
i wish they would so a man could get some sleep at night
but my design is a mixture of descent and decay
i see a monster in the mirror fucking every day
can a man ever wash his hands of blood
perpetual déjà vu isnt that enough

prechorus
peel back the layers
and see what ive become
satisfied now i feel nothing
stay away i swear it wasnt me

verse 2
see if you can relish if you close both eyes
every time i make an issue of it someone dies
carried out like a hit man set in stone
dont know why i even bother to be left alone
in my opinion its a selfserving fuckedup phase
got a picture in my wallet that i keep in case i
gotta go gotta split gotta make it to a higher level than this
but i could be wrong what i say is wrong what i really want to say is
you might also likeprechorus
peel back the layers
and see what ive become
satisfied now i feel nothing
stay away i swear it wasnt me

chorus
run it doesnt matter
i need all the miracles that i can gather
run i cant pretend
i put myself in idle hands again

verse 3
heres how it ends just a bit too soon
riverdeep in all the shit i let myself get into
doesnt anybody like it here
blank looks television drama and no fear
let another person fuck with your mind
i bet you become the person who will fuck in time
man i just stopped caring the music is blaring
i feel you glaring why wont you stop staring

prechorus
peel back the layers
and see what ive become
satisfied now i feel nothing
stay away i swear it wasnt me
chorus
run it doesnt matter
i need all the miracles that i can gather
run i cant pretend
i put myself in idle hands again

outro
get the fuck off of meembed"
