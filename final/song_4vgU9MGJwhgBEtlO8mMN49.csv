lately i cant help but think
that our roads might take us down different phases
dont wanna complicate the rhythm that weve got
but im speechless
when everythings so pure can it be aimless
painless

prechorus
if you ever go all the songs that we like
will sound like bittersweet lullabies

chorus
lost in the blue
they dont love me like you do
those chills that i knew
they were nothing without you
and everyone else
they dont matter now
youre the one i cant lose
no one loves me like you do

verse 2
since i met you
all the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
consider what weve got
cause i can never take you for granted
is there another us on this whole planet

i dont wanna seem foolish
when im jumping into this
youre all that i see
