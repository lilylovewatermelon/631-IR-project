take a photograph itll be the last
not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here
i dont have a past i just have a chance
not a family or honest plea remains to say

chorus
rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

verse 2
is it you i want or just the notion of
a heart to wrap around so i can find my way around
safe to say from here youre getting closer now
we are never sad cause we are not allowed to be

chorus
rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

bridge
to lie here under you is all that i could ever do
to lie here under you is all

come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun4embed"
