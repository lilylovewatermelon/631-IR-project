hard days made me hard nights shaped me
i dont know they somehow saved me
and i know im making something
out of this life they called nothing

verse 1
i take what i want take what i need
they say its wrong but its right for me
i wont look down wont say im sorry
i know that only god can judge me

prechorus
and if i make it through the day will tomorrow be the same
am i just running in place
and if i stumble and i fall should i get up and carry on
will it all just be the same

chorus
because im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this
im going nowhere fast thats what they say
im troublesome im fallen im angry at my father
its me against this world and i dont care

postchorus
i dont care

and no one in this industry understands the life i lead
when i sing about my past its not a gimmick not an act
these critics and these trust fund kids try to tell me what punk is
but when i see them on the streets they got nothing to say

prechorus
and if i make it through the day will tomorrow be the same
am i just running in place
and if i stumble and i fall should i get up and carry on
will it all just be the same

chorus
because im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this
im going nowhere fast thats what they say
im troublesome im fallen im angry at my father
its me against this world and i dont care

bridge
i dont care i dont care no i dont care

im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this
