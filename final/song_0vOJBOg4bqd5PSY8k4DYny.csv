you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yourself through my eyes
youre so fake its all lies
was she good just what you liked
did you come how many times
tell the truth wait never mind

verse 1
i cant forgive i cant forget
i shouldve known youre full of it
im not upset im fucking pissed
i spelled it out youre illiterate
did you do the things you know i like
roll your tongue make her come twenty times
dont tell me to relax or try to get me back
im packing up your bags

chorus
you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yoursеlf through my eyes
youre so fakе its all lies
was she good just what you liked
did you come how many times
tell the truth wait never mind
see ​girl in red liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
never listen to a monologue
told by a lying fraud
i dont need to make sense
of all your bullshit reasons
did you listen to her heartbeat like you did with me
was it more than sex pure physicality
dont bother giving me any more bad apologies

chorus
you should know better now
to fuck it up and fuck around
see yourself through my eyes
youre so fake its all lies
was she good just what you liked
did you come how many times
tell the truth wait never mind

outro
she was a different kind made you feel satisfied
momentary happiness makes you feel alive
you had it all but you get easily seduced by
the things that rip me apart
im a safe bet but you get intrigued
by uncertainty and mystique
was i stupid enough to believe you would change that for me12embed"
