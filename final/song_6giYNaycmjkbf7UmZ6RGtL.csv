now you can call me tip drill they playing my song
throw a couple ones then she throw away her thongs
when she bust it open take a picture with my phone
she love my cologne 
now she jockin its goin down
slap the waitress on the booty tell her get another round
and when i make it rain money all over the ground
fresh force ones sean john button down
and then im like oh boy a clique fulla stars
big four fifth big dk and big cars
at the end of the day when its all said and done
i need four freaks cause i need more than one
