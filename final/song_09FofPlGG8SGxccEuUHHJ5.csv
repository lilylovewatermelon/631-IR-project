i’m walking a wire
feels like a thousand ways i could fall
to want is to buy but to live is to die
and you can’t take it all
when everything is said and done i won’t have one thing left
what happened to everything that ive ever known

chorus
cause all they gave me was this ticket to heaven
but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make
now i’m restless and i’m running from everything
i’m running from everything
i’m afraid it’s a little too late

verse 2
when soft voices lie innocence dies
now aint that a shame
and all your dreams
and all your money they don’t mean a thing
when everything is said and done
you won’t have one thing left
what happened to everything that ive ever known

chorus
cause all they gave me was this ticket to heaven
but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make
now i’m restless and i’m running from everything
i’m running from everything
i’m afraid it’s a little too late
you might also likerefrain
it’s a little too late

chorus
all they gave me was this ticket to heaven
but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make
now i’m restless and i’m running from everything
i’m running from everything
i’m afraid it’s a little too late
all they gave me was this ticket to heaven
but that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make
now i’m restless and i’m running from everything
i’m running from everything
i’m afraid it’s a little too lateembed"
