fuck your mind up waste time
iâ€™m prone to that do it all the time
keep your guard up or wait in line
you dont need me please believe me
this aint easy you know ive been feindin
let me unleash my demons on you

chorus
whats the word tell me what youve heard
dont tell me what to do just tell me when it hurts
when i get you to myself its murder
whats the word tell me what youve heard
dont tell me what to do just tell me when it hurts
when i get you to myself its murder

verse 2
what you mean you and me im here all by myself
you around shes around lets be polite and not leave her out
what the fuck you call this hopeless not romantic
i aint got no kids so dont be so childish
you be wildin i be wildin too
but not like you shit maybe a little like you
maybe we aint so different maybe i be trippin too

chorus
whats the word tell me what youve heard
dont tell me what to do just tell me when it hurts
when i get you to myself its murder
whats the word tell me what youve heard
dont tell me what to do just tell me when it hurts
when i get you to myself its murder

if he was a winner
girl you wouldnt have to worry bout a damn thing
if i was up in it shit i bet a pound that id put it down
make you forget that you was ever with him
and i hate talking bout my stroke game
but girl im giving you the whole thing
i could put like 25 on your finger five for your shades
so you cant see these other niggas
they wont call you again thats enough
i could see youre wasting time
would you pay it out to me youre in the wrong hands
i just want to clock in night and day ill stay
ill be more open if you keep it open
