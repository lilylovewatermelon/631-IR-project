breaking free
we�re soarin� flyin�
there�s not a star in heaven
that we can�t reach

if we�re trying
so we�re breaking free

you know the world can see us
in a way that�s different than who we are

creating space between us
�til we�re separate hearts

but your faith it gives me strength
strength to believe

we�re breakin� free
we�re soarin�
flyin�
there�s not a star in heaven
that we can�t reach
if we�re trying
yeah we�re breaking free
oh we�re breakin� free
ohhhh
can you feel it building
like a wave the ocean just can�t control
connected by a feeling
ohhh in our very souls
rising �til it lifts us up
so every one can see
