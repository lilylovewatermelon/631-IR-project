stand beside it we cant hide the way you make us glow
its no good unless it grows
feel this burning love of mine
deep inside the ever spinning
tell me does it feel
its no good unless its real
hillsides burning wildeyed turning til were running from it

chorus
id take care of you if youd ask me to
in a year or two

verse 2
you say swimming in the lake well come across a snake
it is real and then its fake
feel its heartbeat feel what you heat
far so fast it feels too late

chorus
id take care of you if youd ask me to
in a year or two

outro
