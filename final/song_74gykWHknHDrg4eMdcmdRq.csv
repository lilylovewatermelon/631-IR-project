ricky racks
for what its worth
you were a slut at birth
if the world had a dick
youd fuck the earth
i tried to get over you
it doesnt work
youre still a cunt
im still a fucking jerk

verse 1
same as it ever was yeah
say itll change but it never does
aint gonna ever cause
youre the cause of my pain and the medicine
never met someone who played games with my head as much
fate tethered us together like two felons
mustve fell in love with skeletons
everyones got em thought that you were cinderella but yeah
feels like i slept with the uh wicked stepmother
but how the hell am i
still in love with the motherfucking chick theres at least a million of
they say love the one you with
but this shit is killing us
our loves on some other shit
im a glutton for punishment
youre the gloves im the punching mitts
its above and beyond us
cuffing im shoving the girl i love inside of an oven
if i catch you sucking another dick
you better unsuck it you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
why am i tucking you in
probably cause

i gotta tell myself another lie
cause thats what helps to get me by
cause im in hell
this is my goodbye farewell

verse 2
wanna hold you wanna choke you wanna love you
wanna hate you wanna kill you wanna hurt you
wanna heal you yeah
wanna lose you keep you bruise you
beat abuse you treat you mutual
its juvenile delusional as usual
youre beautiful im average woo
im brutal youre a savage
my ride or die chick whos always cruising for a bruising
yeah its kinda like were tryna light a dynamite stick
though we might get along like shit
fight hit bite spit unite split
yeah youre awful but youre mine
and they say love is blind we see each other fine
but its no wonder im yeah the only one youll find uh
to put up with your shit what i need a plumber line yeah
but nothing comes to mind nah besides the number 90 no
cause since 06 you flipped my fucking life upside down
now the skys ground look at my frown its a smile now
look at my mouth its my eyebrows make it rain upwards
were on that ninth cloud two insane lovebirds
i should fly south cause man am i great aint lyin to myself
but im just plain stubborn im audi five thou

then we duke it out then it dies down
then we say fuck it cry our eyes out
then
chorus
i gotta tell myself another lie
cause thats what helps to get me by
cause im in hell
this is my goodbye farewell

verse 3
this relationship is all that its cracked up to be
never lack lust in that cause we act nuts
cause thats what attracts us
trick you with a back rub
tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub haha
yeah now thats love may sound pathetic
but fuck the world cause they out to get us
i love you but i wont exchange vows
hey now dont get carried away
no way ill get married itll take a rain cloud to wed us
yeah but were so insane ‘bout each other
may take the same route and way out as junior seau
break out berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
who knows how its gonna play out
or whether deaths what our ending will be
one of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
but ill go to bat for you defending your honor
yeah no contingency fees something we’re not nah
were not pretending to beef dont cost a penny to be with me
time were spending is free we could be broke as a joke
wont make a difference to me dont have to give me a thing
couldve been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
love unconditionally theres no other fish in the sea
guess im a prisoner see addiction is a disease
chorus
i gotta tell myself another lie
cause thats what helps to get me by
cause im in hell
this is my goodbye farewell

outro
love you girl do you feel the same
i dont wanna play games no games ah
youre the only one that can out my flame
baby just play it straight straight no games ah46embed"
