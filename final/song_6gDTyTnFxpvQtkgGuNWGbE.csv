i feel for you but when did you believe you were alone
you say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
where light once was

verse 2
petrified of who you are and who you have become
you will hide from everyone denying you need
someone to exterminate your bones

chorus
friend please remove your hands
from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend please dont take your life away from me

verse 3
living like a ghost you walk by everyone you know
you say that youre fine but you have lost your sway and glow
so i stopped by to let you know

chorus
friend please remove your hands
from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend please dont take your life away from me
you might also likebridge
would you let me know your plans tonight
cause i just wont let go til we both see the light
and i have nothing else oh left to say
but i will listen to you all day
yes i will

outro
friend please remove your hands
from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend please dont take your life away from me66embed"
