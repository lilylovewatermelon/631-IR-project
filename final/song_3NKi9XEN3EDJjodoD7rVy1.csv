im an animal im a victim
im the answer to your prayers
im a witness on a witch hunt
im the monster up the stairs
im the ghost thats in the mirror
im everything that you fear
im the ripped heart im the soul shot
im the voice thats in your ear

chorus
ive seen it all still cant taste it
smashed to the wall it brought me to my knees
ive done it all fucked up wasted
still in my blood but now inside im sane

verse 2
im the hunted im a predator
im the answer to the riddle
im the upbeat im the headfuck
im the way ive left in the middle
im the player undenying
im the one whos not addicted
im the logic to the fuck up
im the broken one who fixed it

im just a child with tears in its eyes
i am holding this gift that is broken
