all is calm all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace

shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing alleluia

son of god loves pure light
radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
