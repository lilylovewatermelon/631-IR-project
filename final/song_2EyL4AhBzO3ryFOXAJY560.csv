open up the book you beat me with again
read it off one sentence at a time
im tired of all the lines
convictions and your lies
what right do you have to point at me

prechorus
well im sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee
and still crowding my space are the things you still hold against me
you cannot save me

chorus
well its not the time to breakdown
its not the time to breakdown
its not the time to break up this love
keep it together now
its not the time to break

verse 2
read it all no need for separating it
you see what you want and try to justify
all your little lines
convictions and your lies
what right do you have to point at me

well im sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee
and still crowding my space are the things you still hold against me

chorus
well its not the time to breakdown
its not the time to breakdown
its not the time to break up this love
keep it together now
its not the time to break

open up the book you beat me with again
read it off one sentence at a time

breakdown
well its not the time to breakdown
well its not the time to breakdown
well its not the time to breakdown
well its not the time to breakdown
well its not the time to breakdown
well its not the time to break up this love
keep it together now
well its not the time to break
