couldnt wait to ride out of that one horse town
didnt see no use in sticking around
i was green and busting at the seams to leave
i was sitting on g waiting on o
the day i hit eighteen i hit the road
traded that county maintain for a four lane city street

prechorus
but sometimes things aint what you think theyre gonna be
what you want aint always what you need

chorus
dont know what you got til its gone
and youre out on your own
all you want is what you cant get back
once you let it go then you know what you have
dont hold a candle to what you had
sometimes what you think youll find
it aint quite what real life has in store
so be careful what you wish for

verse 2
she was holding on just a little too tight
talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
i broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free
well sometimes things aint what you think theyre gonna be

dont know what you got til its gone
and youre out on your own
all you want is what you cant get back
once you let it go then you know what you have
dont hold a candle to what you had
sometimes what you think youll find
it aint quite what real life has in store
so be careful what you wish for

bridge
cause these city lights cant shine quite like the stars
i wish i could wish her back into my arms

chorus
dont know what you got til its gone
and youre out on your own
all you want is what you cant get back
once you let it go then you know what you have
dont hold a candle to what you had
sometimes what you think youll find
it aint quite what real life has in store
and you cant get her back no more
so be careful what you wish for
be careful what you wish for1embed"
