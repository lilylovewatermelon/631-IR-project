i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
not what youd think
and if im bein honest
it mightve been a nightmare
to anyone who might care
thought i could fly fly
so i stepped off the golden mm
nobody cried cried cried cried cried
nobody even noticed
i saw them standing right there
kinda thought they might care might care might care

prechorus
i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up i see
you with me

chorus
and you say as long as im here no one can hurt you
dont wanna lie here but you can learn to
if i could change the way that you see yourself
you wouldnt wonder why you hear
they dont deserve you

i tried to scream
but my head was underwater
they called me weak
like im not just somebodys daughter
coulda been a nightmare
but it felt like they were right there
and it feels like yesterday was a year ago
but i dont wanna let anybody know
cause everybody wants something from me now
and i dont wanna let em down

prechorus
i had a dream
i got everything i wanted
but when i wake up i see
you with me

chorus
and you say as long as im here no one can hurt you
dont wanna lie here but you can learn to
if i could change the way that you see yourself
you wouldnt wonder why you hear
they dont deserve you

outro
if i knew it all then would i do it again
would i do it again
if they knew what they said would go straight to my head
what would they say instead
if i knew it all then would i do it again
would i do it again
if they knew what they said would go straight to my head
what would they say instead304embed"
