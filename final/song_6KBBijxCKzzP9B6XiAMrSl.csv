a nature to nurture
an instinct to sin
whats underneath the skin you live in
you trade your unlimited
your precious creation
you will submit
you will give in

chorus
suddenly i have no strength at all
so suddenly hit with all ive lost
suddenly my world is falling apart
so suddenly so suddenly
suddenly

verse 2
you say youre a victim
but thats just a symptom
its so very clear
you volunteered
why are you fighting just stop your denying
own up to the sin
you bury within

chorus
see creed liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeverse 3
i have no strength at all
ive been hit with a loss
so suddenly my world falls apart
i have no strength at all
ive been hit with a loss
suddenly my world falls apart
my world falls apart my world
