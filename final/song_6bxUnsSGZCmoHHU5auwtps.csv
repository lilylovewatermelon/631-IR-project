when you said it was over you shot right through my heart
why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
ooh i was so mad i shouldve seen this coming right from the start
you should beware beware beware of a woman with a broken heart

verse 1 big sean
yeah praying to a sky all black
looking at the stars like they finna talk back
looking at my phone like she finna call back
but last night i feel like probably ended all that
cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
then another one tryna take it all back
saying fuck you i miss you or i hate you so much
cause girls only say hate you to the guys that they love
i know i know i know
the highs the lows it comes it goes
you say be real i try i dont
cause you take anything and just make it everything god
kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring funny right
and i never cheated i mean maybe once or twice
but one time dont change everything
she ask why i dont feel the same im still the same
shes still insane and now shes saying

chorus big sean  jhené aiko
when you said it was over you shot right through my heart

verse 3 lil wayne

i be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
you know they never like it when you never say never
long hair red bone but her pussy is hairless

i be screaming out aint no woman like the one i got
but she be always worrying about the one i fucked
she said its gonna be me myself and i

but players fuck up my bad
and just to keep from crying i laughed
