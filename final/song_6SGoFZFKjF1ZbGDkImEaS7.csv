it’s a wide ocean
and a tight emotion
and our homes are chosen
yet still we’re all broken
it’s been a while since that old town
down by the water picking stones from the ground

chorus
take me home
to the friends i’ve always known
take me home
back to the place where i belong

verse 2
a distant coast line
what peaks insight
washed the wide
of that ocean’s tide
need to slow down
and look around
not that far from that place we came

chorus
take me home
to the friends i’ve always known
take me home
back to the place where i belongsee hollow coves liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like2embed"
