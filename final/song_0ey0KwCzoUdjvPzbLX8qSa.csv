save your breath
dont you break your neck
im seeing signs inside my head
a car crash in the woods
im saving things that i think youll need
on and on until you bleed
could i be imagining worse things
take me for granted and a sin
ill be in on it on it on it

chorus
ill be in on it
feeling all this energy
call me up when you feel sick
ill be in on it on it on it

verse 2
i havent been eating much this week
eatings for the strong
sleeps for the weak
falling in the same routine i see
ill be in on it on it on it

chorus
ill be in on it
feeling all this energy
call me up when you feel sick
ill be in on it on it on it
you might also likebridge
dont touch me
i feel hurt when you leave
nobody could understand
what this does to me

verse 3
and i know just what i need
autumn leaves and fallen trees
to feel the cold beneath my feet
ill be in on it on it on it

chorus
ill be in on it
feeling all this energy
call me up when you feel sick
ill be in on it on it on it

outro
on it
on it
