youre up on your high heels youre up on the bar
youre up on a level up there with the shooting stars
dancing around the drinks with honkey tonk angel wings
making the party sing yeah thats my baby
it aint even midnight yet theres a whole lot of neon left
looks like were gonna get all kinds of crazy

chorus
well be up like the sun in the new jersey sky
up like the wheels on a bahama flight
twisting that bottle tipping that cup
girl the way you rock me you know that you got me up

verse 2
youre up on the tailgate youre up on a 3 beer buzz
youre up like the music pumping out of the cab of my truck
up where the city lights cant help but get get outshined
by the blue jeans and brown eyes i pull in closer
yeah this nights far from over with

chorus
still up like the sun in the new jersey sky
up like the wheels on a bahama flight
twisting that bottle tipping that cup
girl the way you rock me you know that you got me
up on a high like im walking on clouds
baby tonight i dont wanna come down

youll be up like the sun in the new jersey sky
up like the wheels on a bahama flight
twisting that bottle tipping that cup
girl the way you rock me you know that you got me
up on a high like im walking on clouds
baby tonight i dont wanna come down
i dont wanna come downembed"
