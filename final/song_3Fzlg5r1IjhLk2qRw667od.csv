we get it on most every night

everybody here is out of sight
they dont bark and they dont bite
they keep things loose they keep em tight
everybodys dancing in the moonlight

everybodys feelin warm and bright

everybodys dancing in the moonlight

we like our fun and we never fight
you cant dance and stay uptight
its a supernatural delight
everybody was dancing in the moonlight

dancing in the moonlight
everybodys feelin warm and bright
