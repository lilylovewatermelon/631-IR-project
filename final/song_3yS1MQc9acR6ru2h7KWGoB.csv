you could be happy and i wont know
but you werent happy the day i watched you go
and all the things that i wish i had not said
are played in loops til its madness in my head
is it too late to remind you how we were
not our last days of silent screamin blur
most of what i remember makes me sure
i should have stopped you from walking out the door

verse 2
you could be happy i hope you are
you made me happier than id been by far
somehow everything i own smells of you
and for the tiniest moment its all not true
do the things that you always wanted to
without me there to hold you back dont think just do
more than anything i want to see you girl
take a glorious bite out of the whole worldsee snow patrol liveget tickets as low as 81you might also like10embed"
