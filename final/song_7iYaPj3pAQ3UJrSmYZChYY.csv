im not afraid of the black man running
hes got it right hes got a better life coming
i dont care what the captain said
i fold it right at the top of my head
i lost my sight and the state packs in
i follow my heart and it leads me right to jackson

chorus
oh keller oh oh oh
she gave us a medal she gave us a map
oh canner row oh oh oh
if seeing is right then look where youre at

verse 2
im not afraid of nichols park
i ride the train and i ride it after dark
im not afraid to get it right
i turn around and i give it one more try
and i said things that i meant to say
the bandstand chairs and the dewey day parade
i go out to the golden age
the spirit is right and the spirit doesnt change

chorus
oh keller oh oh oh
she gave us a mirror she gave us a map
oh canner row oh oh oh
if seeing is right then look where youre at
