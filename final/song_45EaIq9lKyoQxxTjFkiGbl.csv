youre so hot teasing me
so youre blue but i cant take a chance on a chick like you
thats something i couldnt do
theres that look in your eyes
i can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
ah but girl youre only a child

chorus
well i can dance with you honey
if you think its funny
does your mother know that youre out
and i can chat with you baby
flirt a little maybe
does your mother know that youre out

postchorus
take it easy take it easy
better slow down girl
thats no way to go
does your mother know
take it easy take it easy
try to cool it girl
take it nice and slow
does your mother know

and i can chat with you baby
flirt a little maybe
