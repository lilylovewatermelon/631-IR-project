intro
whoa with a nigga like me
whoa with a nigga like me

verse 1
she said please mercy me mercy me
let me fall outta love before you fuck her before you fuck her
she begged me she gave me all her pills
now my back hurts she lost control

hook
now she pleading she on the floor she on the floor
baby got her pleading she on the floor she on the floor
she said it wont be long before she falls out of love
it wont be long before she falls out of love

youre gonna leave her
you have deceived her
youre just a bird
