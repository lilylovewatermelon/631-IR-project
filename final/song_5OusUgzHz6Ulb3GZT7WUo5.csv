driving through town
just my boy and me
with a happy meal in his booster seat
knowing that he couldnt have the toy
till his nuggets were gone
a green traffic light turned straight to red
i hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
his fries went aflying and his orange drink covered his lap
well then my four year old said a four letter word
that started with s and i was concerned
so i said son now where did you learn to talk like that

chorus
he said ive been watching you dad aint that cool
im your buckaroo i wanna be like you
and eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
we got cowboy boots and camo pants
yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
i wanna do everything you do
so ive been watching you

verse 2
we got back home and i went to the barn
i bowed my head and i prayed real hard
said lord please help me help my stupid self
then this side of bedtime later that night
turning on my sons scooby doo nightlight
he crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
he closed his little eyes folded his little hands
and spoke to god like he was talking to a friend
and i said son now whered you learn to pray like that
you might also likechorus
he said ive been watching you dad aint that cool
im your buckaroo i wanna be like you
and eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
we like fixing things and holding mamas hand
yeah were just alike hey aint we dad
i wanna do everything you do
so ive been watching you

bridge
with tears in my eyes i wrapped him in a hug
said my little bear is growing up
he said but when im big ill still know what to do

chorus
cause ive been watching you dad aint that cool
im your buckaroo i wanna be like you
and eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
by then ill be as strong as superman
well be just alike hey wont we dad
when i can do everything you do
cause ive been watching you4embed"
