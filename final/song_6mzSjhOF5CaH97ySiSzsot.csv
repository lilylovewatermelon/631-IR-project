let’s go for a drive
and see the town tonight
there’s nothing to do
but i don’t mind when i’m with you

verse 2
this town’s so strange
they built it to change
and while we sleep
we know the streets get rearranged
with my old friends
it was so different then
before your war
against the suburbs began
before it began

verse 3
now the music divides
us into tribes
you grew your hair
so i grew mine
you said the past won’t rest
until we jump the fence
and leave it behind
with my old friends
i can remember when
you cut your hair
i never saw you again
now the cities we live in
could be distant stars
and i search for you
in every passing car
see arcade fire liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likechorus
the night’s so long
yeah the night’s so long
i’ve been living in the shadows of your song
been living in the shadows of your song

verse 4
in the suburbs i
i learned to drive
and you told me we would never survive
so grab your mother’s keys we leave tonight
but you started a war
that we can’t win
they keep erasing all the streets
we grew up in
now the music divides
us into tribes
you choose your side
i’ll choose my side

outro
all my old friends they don’t know me now
all my old friends are staring through me now
all my old friends they don’t know me now
all my old friends they don’t know me now
they don’t know me now
all my old friends wait5embed"
