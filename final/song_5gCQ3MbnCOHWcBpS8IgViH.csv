dont go in the summertime
its too hot and the rooms are high
but if you go in the fall youll have a ball
theres so much to see and do
when youre in love

verse 1
theres an old hotel right on the beach
romantic rooms you wont want to leave
but take my word take a stroll into town
theres so much to see and do
when youre in love

verse 2
dont miss jamaica joes
you can dine out fresco
then dance in the street till the sun comes up
you can take a barefoot cruise
share a moonlight made for two
theres so little time and so much to see and do
when youre in love

bridge
be sure and take lots of pictures when youre there
be sure and make lots of memories trust me
