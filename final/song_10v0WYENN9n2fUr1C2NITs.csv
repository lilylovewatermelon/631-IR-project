dead president fuck the president
masons strive for power while i work to save my residence
he owns you even though he never told you
mark of the beast on your hand now he owns you

prechorus
thrown down to the bottom level
ruled by the fist and the fist is the devil
i metamorphosize and make myself level
we are the future we are right now

verse 2
right now
im taking a stab at the sick sick sick
i know what evil is and evil can suck my dick
like samhain and the god is no joke
better watch your neck cause you might get choked

prechorus

chorus
you sink we swim we rise you fall we meet our fate together
i was here from the start and ill be here in the end
in the end

im dodging arrows from the dark side everyday
and im a main target cause of what i say
infinitely always go against the grain
and question everything before he takes your brain
