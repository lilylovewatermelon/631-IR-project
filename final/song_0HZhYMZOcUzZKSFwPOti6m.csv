i know i cant take one more step towards you
cause all thats waiting is regret
and dont you know im not your ghost anymore
you lost the love i love the most

prechorus
i learned to live halfalive
and now you want me one more time

chorus
and who do you think you are
runnin round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts
and tearing love apart
youre gonna catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
so dont come back for me
who do you think you are

remember how to put back the light in my eyes
i wish i had missed the first time that we kissed
cause you broke all your promises
and now youre back
