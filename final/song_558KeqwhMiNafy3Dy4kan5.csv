all dressed up
in a white straitjacket
shut your mouth
no you cant have it

prechorus
paper airplanes
open window
here today
and gone tomorrow

chorus
i like to stare at the sun
and think about what ive done
i lie awake in my great escape
i like crossing the line
and slowly losing my mind
are you okay
cause i feel fine
maybe its me
im just crazy
maybe i like that im not alright

verse 2
all messed up
and slightly twisted
