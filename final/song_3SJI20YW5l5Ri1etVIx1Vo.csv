holy something in the wind
in my dreams ive seen your face
brave as brave has ever known
i watched your soul out the window

prechorus
you asked for my hand i gave you mine
for the last time
you looked in my soul you said it’s time
you’ll be just fine

chorus
i’ve seen holy smoke out the window
you’ll rise up through the shadows with a new glow
farewell my friend it’s over now
be well my friend yeah

verse 2
sometimes my father’s looking up
how he yearns to hear your voice
if there’s a god how could he mold
a life so cruel yet so bold

prechorus
you asked for my hand i gave you mine
for the last time
you looked in my soul you said it’s time
you’ll be just fine
