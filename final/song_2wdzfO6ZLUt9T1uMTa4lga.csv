your booty might be bigger
but i still can pull your nigga
but i dont want him
you got sugar on your pita
but your nigga thinks im sweeter
but i dont want him
you know the whole encyclopedia
but your nigga thinks im deeper
but i dont want him
got a whole lot a junk off in your trunk
but your nigga think im live and i keep him crunk
i dont want him

refrain
hey hey hey
i dont want him cause of what hes doing to you
and you dont need him cause he aint ready
see i dont want him
if he aint made no arrangement with you
i hope you wouldve done the same thing for me too

verse 2
your kisses might be wetter
but your nigga likes mine better
but i dont want him
you got the beans and rice and the hot hocakes
but your nigga still over here in my plate
i dont want him
you got a phd magna cum laude
but your nigga love me with a ged
i dont want him
you the one with all the money
and he knows my moneys funny
but i dont want him
see erykah badu liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likerefrain
hey hey hey
i dont want him cause of what hes done to you
and you dont need him cause he aint ready
see i dont want him
if he aint made no arrangement with you
and you dont need him cause the boy aint ready

verse 3
got your pad all decked out fo sho
but your niggas at my door though
but i dont want him
well you can do the butterfly and the tootsie roll
but your nigga straight sprung off the way i stroll
i dont want him
you know the whole 120 and a plus degree
but you cant keep your god up off his knees
i dont want him
you got a ninetofive and a sixtoten
but your nigga told me not to work again
i dont want him

refrain
hey hey hey
see i dont want him cause of what hes doing to you
and you dont need him cause he aint ready
see i dont want him
if he aint made no arrangement with you
i hope you wouldve done the same thing for me too2embed"
