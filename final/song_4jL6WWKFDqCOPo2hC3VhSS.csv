if youre not the one for me
then how come i can bring you to your knees
if youre not the one for me
why do i hate the idea of being free
and if im not the one for you
youve gotta stop holdin me the way you do
oh honey if im not the one for you
why have we been through what we have been through

prechorus
its so cold out here here here here
in your wilderness eh eh eh
i want you to be my keeper eh eh eh
but not if you are so reckless

chorus
if youre gonna let me down let me down gently
dont pretend that you dont want me
our love aint water under the bridge
if youre gonna let me down let me down gently
dont pretend that you dont want me
our love aint water under the bridge
