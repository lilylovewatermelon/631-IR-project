yeah thats my old girlfriend
i saw her when she walked in
her hairs a little longer but shes still lookin stronger than sin
no i dont care if you buy her a drink
but shes not the kind of girl youd think
oh cause back when we were lovin
she thought cowboys were something
now they aint

chorus
cause shes over buckles
shes over spurs
to her youre just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
been lassoed and let go for the last time
no she aint just over me
shes over me and my kind

verse 2
i guess i ruined it for the rest of us
when i left her standing in my dust
oh and lately shes been hating rodeos and copenhagen
and trucks ha

chorus
yeah shes over buckles
shes over spurs
to her youre just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
been lassoed and let go for the first time
no she aint just over me
shes over me and my kind

chorus
yeah shes over buckles
shes over spurs
to her youre just a heartache in a wrangler pearl snap shirt
lassoed and let go for the last time
she aint just over me
shes over me and my kind
she aint just over me
shes over me and my kindembed"
