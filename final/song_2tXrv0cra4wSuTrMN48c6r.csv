violence in the air cutthroat stares
were just window shopping
wont you dance with me
im gonna knock you down
have you after hours

verse 2
too many sherbet dips youll get licked
if you carry on this way
beautiful punchbag
im gonna lay you down
just call me mr brown

verse 3
im not that kind of man in the day
wont you hold me steady spectacular rival
and ive had my medicine
although youre not my friend
i love you till the end

chorus

heavens got a place for me
your majesty
why you got it in for me
