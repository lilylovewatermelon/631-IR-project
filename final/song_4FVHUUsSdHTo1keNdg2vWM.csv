little missy miss shes had some troubles but
she gonna sort it out early in the morning
and when you come home youre gonna watch her sleeping
hold her close and stroke her face
in the morning youre gonna stare at her
and wonder why you feel the way you do now
but she will hold you and reach out to touch you
and never never never hurt your heart

prechorus 1
oh its easy but its just too easy for you now
she gives you everything but thats not what you wanna do

chorus 1
and in the morning when she wakes up
you walk away now you dont turn around
but she holds you she holds you in her heart
shell never let you go

verse 2
in the evening when you come home
you save the whiskey and you talk about your dreams now
and you hold her when she cries cause
shes feeling lonely  the same way that you do
when youre feeling the way youre feeling now
you hold the pillow and you think about her
and when she holds you your cold stare melts
and your heart warms to her

she gives you everything but thats not what you wanna do

chorus 2
and in the morning youre just gonna turn round
youre gonna break it  youre gonna break the bond
youre gonna smash the bottle of whiskey
and after all the things that she told you
youre gonna make love like you never cared
youre gonna make it feel like she meant nothing to you no no
she gonna cry now and wonder why now
the way you made her feel

but shes gonna make it  shes a strong one
and your heart well its already melted
but she will never dissolve

youre gonna need her she gonna love you
and melt your cold stare
