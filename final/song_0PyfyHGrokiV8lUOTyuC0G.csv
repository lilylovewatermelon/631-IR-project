here it goes
chemical is on its way
and my box is packed
or should i stay its coming
we can analyze philosophize
but whos to say
all we know is
were here today

chorus
look in my eyes
this is just the reason why i stay
i know there are things we shouldnt say
blame it on the reason why i came
maybe cause i couldnt feel the
pain

verse 2
fight the fear
taste the grip
feel the slip
shake the soul
feel the waves
in and out and in and out and in and out
you might also likechorus

verse 3
feel the weight wash away
all the mistakes ive made
living in time on my own
tearing the soul from bone
letting the tide suck me in
and chemicals burst in
these are my only friends
giving me waves until the end
