wish you gave me your number
wish i could call you today
just to hear a voice
i got a long way to go im getting further away

verse 2
if i didnt know the difference
living alone would probably be okay
it wouldnt be lonely
i got a long way to go im getting further away

chorus
a lot of hours to occupy it was easy when i didnt know you yet
things id have to forget
but i better be quiet now im tired of wasting my breath
carrying on and getting upset

verse 3
maybe i have a problem
but thats not what i wanted to say
id prefer to say nothing
i got a long way to go im getting further away

chorus
had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
while a dead enemy screams in my face
but i better be quiet now im tired of wasting my breath
carrying on not over it yet

wish i knew what youre doing
and why you want to do it this way
so i cant go the distance
i got a long way to go im getting further away
i got a long way to go im getting further away4embed"
