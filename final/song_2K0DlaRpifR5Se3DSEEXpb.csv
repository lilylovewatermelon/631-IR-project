perched alone he sits there broken
an elder man with storm clouds setting in his eyes
he counts the sands of time remembering days gone by
its seemed like yesterday before it washed away

chorus
hey dont wait for me there
just find your own way
hey dont wait for me there
cause ill be there soon enough

verse 2
a widow’s life ticks out like clockwork
a thousand tears shes cried a hundred times before
but now that he is gone shes ready to move on
it all just fell away it seems like yesterday

chorus
hey dont wait for me there
just find your own way
hey dont wait for me there
cause ill be there soon enough
i’ll be there soon enough

chorus
hey dont wait for me there
just find your own way
hey dont wait for me there
cause ill be there soon enoughsee five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also like6embed"
