matty healy my nana who i was close to died of cancer this year and it was around about that time that the guitarist’s mum got diagnosed with cancer and it felt like it was a big impact the fact that something you have no control over can really mess with the dynamics of people’s lives it’s actually a live guitar take i was playing the guitar plugged in the computer and george was putting it through every plugin you can imagine he recorded it without telling me so i was in the zone this was 2am on a saturday night so we were under the influence i recorded the guitar take and we listened to it back hammered and we were like ‘this is really pretty man nah let’s get some sleep’ we woke up the next day and we just spent like half an hour putting little moments of vocals and synth and that was that i think music for cars is the most honest record in regards to things like thatsee the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also like11embed"
