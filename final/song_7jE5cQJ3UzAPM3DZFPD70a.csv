turn me up dissan

verse 1
eagles beak to the street flowers bought to put on a grave
im wishin when its time that my grandbaby do the same
look in your eyes mama you full of pain
im so sorry that i never changed
baby mama im trippin
oh so now can you forgive me
smokin my lungs when im wishin
i need the book thats been written
im on a quest they left a money trail oh
and i aint go to heaven cause i live in hell oh
peter pan dope tan dope man no luck though it aint blowin
cause he aint have a ace he had a jack
lookin at you gon get yo shit bust you booked bro try to jet
thats a new doublеr truck and thats a stolo fourdoor jag

chorus
i done wandered in thе wrong town
different groups with different kind of colors on
and they all got guns out
ive been wavin but nobody slow down
you might also likeinterlude
ooh
ah

verse 2
life like soprano trunk filled with ammo
feel i get more lost the more rich i get
long as you gone i start to care no more
read the encyclopedia my flaws on wikipedia
broken souls aint nothin but creatures here
if i blow the strap im leavin you look here
ball for the media no cheer for the sunlight
woke up in snowstorm on a slow night
christ gon return right
money tall like the eiffel tower
nigga thats i
i take a and place it over you and the d come when you die
alright leave with a liquor disease
the blick that they bought tension and we brought some sticks for to squeeze
he get stuffed in some leaves tell a truck to stay out my way
aint bein friendly with nobody cause i know it aint safe

chorus
i done wandered in the wrong town
different groups with different kind of colors on
and they all got guns out
ive been wavin but nobody slow downembed"
