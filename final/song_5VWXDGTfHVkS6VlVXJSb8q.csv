verse 3 r kelly
now gimme the mic so i can get buck wild
like fiesta fiesta still moving the crowd
out of all the girls ive loved before
got plenty of honeys
puff puff give now let me hit it once more
fake ass niggas get out and close my door
its my house for me to live not yours
if i wanted to i could on the floors
through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk
penny and chris you know that boys tow up
about 8 or 9 black stallion riding up
its mr big screaming showdown im like what
mr big
now kelly
its not enough room in this town
for you and me so lets get down
im sick and tired of you and this down low fight
from contagious all the way to mrs price
you done it now with ms black asia
i knew something was funny when she stopped paging
house cars shopping mall
man i tell you its a battle call
like a raging bull
im about to charge
kelly you wont see tomorrow
its time to put a end to your late night creeps
now any last words before my pistol speaks

r kelly spits
mr biggs
now no disrespect but man im tired
cause all these years its my back youve been riding
weve been in and out of fights on these videos
now its about time you felt the real rodeo
see i dated lila 98 of september
you took her from me yea right you dont remember
i remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
how clever you were when you slipped her your number
ooh i know that makes yall wanna know
ooh whos really on the down low
you wonder why were always at it there it is
sleeves up mr biggs
cause im about to get wild wild west
sick and tired of your mess
you put me to the test
and now im sticking out my chest
so any last words before i draw these cannons
cause when the smoke clears ill be the last man standing
