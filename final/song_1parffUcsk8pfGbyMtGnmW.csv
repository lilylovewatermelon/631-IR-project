take out the stories
theyve put into your mind
and brace for the glory
as you stare into the sky
the sky beneath
i know you cant be tired

verse 2
lay there stare at the ceiling
and switch back to your time
just go ahead and try and taste it
i know it should be ripe

prechorus
thrust ahead

chorus
turning in circles
been caught in a stasis
the ancient arrival
cut to the end
id like to be taken
apart from the inside
then spit through the cycle
right to the end

i wonder just how you shaped it
to get back to your prize

then spit through the cycle
right to the end

wake for the glory
i know you cant be tired
