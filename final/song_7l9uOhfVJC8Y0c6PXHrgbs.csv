are you worth your weight in gold
cause youre behind my eyelids when im all alone
hey stranger i want you to catch me like a cold
you and god both got the guns when you shoot i think id duck

prechorus
i led the revolution in my bedroom
and i set all the zippers free
we said no more war no more clothes give me peace
oh kiss me

chorus
hey hey we are a hurricane drop our anchors in a storm
hey they will never be the same a fire in a flask to keep us warm
cause they know i know that they dont look like me
oh they know i know that they dont sound like me

postchorus
youll dance to anything youll dance to anything

verse 2
oh id confess id confess in a room where i’m blessed
but he didnt come and speak to me or put my heart at ease
and i believe that half the time i am a wolf among the sheep
gnawing at the wool over my eyes
