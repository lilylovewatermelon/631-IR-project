12hunna on the beat
goddamn bj with another one uh

verse 1
we do some expensive stunting uh
i got this drip from london uh
youd think he play in the post from the way that he come off the hip or something uh
empty a clip or somethin
fn make him trip from runnin
im speeding my engine hummin
we aint totin these blicks for nothin
come through and slam on a nigga like drummond
im with the cappers you know how we bomin
not from atlanta im talking bout losing your top i done seen all them demons get summoned
come from the bottom so i gotta reach to the top now i need sixtyfive for a frontend
now that louis bag filled up with hundreds
i was so broke man that shit was disgusting

chorus
like boom
we make it hot like its june
turn his white tee to maroon
we put him up like a hotair balloon
now they claimin he left too soon
like move
bitch you aint leaving with me i dont know why thats what you assume
like cool
deep in that struggle for real i aint never had no silver spoon
you might also likeverse 2
runnin the city might need me a statue or somethin
like watch out for cap cause he coming
we with the shits and a tool what i pack like im plumbin
send a hit just from tappin a button
they wanna know why a young nigga flexing so hard
how he run up that sack all the sudden
im off a pill i wont cut her no slack when we fuckin
put dick in the back of her stomach
now go rounds blow
man down woah
blow out his mind gross
uh and them hitters come out at the nighttime
they pop out the cut at the right time
them shells jumpin out of that pipe flyin
end of the tunnel he gon see that light shine

chorus
like boom
we make it hot like its june
turn his white tee to maroon
we put him up like a hotair balloon
now they claimin he left too soon
like move
bitch you aint leaving with me i dont know why thats what you assume
like cool
deep in that struggle for real i aint never had no silver spoon uh9embed"
