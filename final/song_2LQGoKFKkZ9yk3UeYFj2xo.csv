grenadine quarantine i like you a lot
its la hey on zoom target parking lot
and if this is the end i want a boyfriend
someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
or walk home from the mall with
cause what i really meant is when im being honest
im tired of this shit

prechorus
cause my body is my temple my heart is one too
the only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
you dont know me any better than they do baby
my time is run over so the only time youll ever see me
is in your dreams in my black bathing suit
lookin at me lookin over at you real cute cause

chorus
he said i was bad let me show you how bad girls do
cause no one does it better
he said i was bad let me show you how bad girls do
cause no one does it better

verse 2
swisher sweet magazines promise you its not
cause of you that im mean its my afterthoughts
and what i never said why theres a price on my head
its nothing to do with them its my karmic lineage
so im not friends with my mother but i still love my dad
untraditional lover can you handle that
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeprechorus
i guess im complicated my lifes sorta too
i wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
you dont know me any better than they do baby
cause i sing like an angel my hearts like one too
the only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
lookin at me lookin over at you real cute cause

chorus
he said i was bad let me show you how bad girls do
cause no one does it better
he said i was bad let me show you how bad girls do
cause no one does it better
they said i was bad and ill show them what bad girls do

outro
my black bathing suit
oh let em talk about me
theyre just yesterdays news
theyre fucking broke and were laughin about them
mail me when you get the blues
well have the last laugh about it
by the way thanks for the shoes
your interest really made stacks
your interest really made stacks
your interest really made stacks out of it
your interest really made stacks out of it for me so thanks for that
your interest really made stacks out of it for me so thanks for that
your interest really made stacks out of it for me
so thanks for that20embed"
