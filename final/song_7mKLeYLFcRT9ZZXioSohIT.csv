chorus
with the nunchucks rollin in your hood
ask a big bad wolf what is good whats good
feelin dumbstruck i done been there done that i like it
but i wonder why i still feel so alone

verse
baby stand up
but dont pull them pants up youre pullin off my shirt
but should i leave my hands up
expression of fandom
you know that ive been good but you still tear the cat up
and when you provoke me you do it at random
i wont lead you on but i hope that you can manage
you dont want to man up you dont want to plan up
but you call me wifey so whats the big idea
do i need to sit right here and fill my ears while bullshit come out of your lips i hear
got me searchin for insight insight guess i need to call this night off
riddle me riddle me that mister unintentional ass
and his every interval fast throw that cheese and dough in that bag
with that little italy swag nigga riddle riddle me that
why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me
gentle then you ease up im day dreamin but im woke
see doja cat liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likebridge
i never daydream
but youre jumpin from rooftops
and searchin and huntin my ninja
woah woah woah

chorus
with the nunchucks rollin in your hood
ask a big bad wolf what is good whats good
feelin dumbstruck i done been there done that i like it
but i wonder why i still feel so alone
ive been there ive been there rollin in your hood oohoohoohoohooh ooh
ask a big bad wolf what is good oohoohoohoohooh ooh
i wonder why i wonder why oohoohoohoohooh ooh
but i wonder why i still feel so alone oohoohoohooh

outro
