remember when
we never needed each other
the best of friends
like sister and brother
we understood
wed never be alone
those days are gone
now i want you so much
the night is long
and i need your touch
dont know what to say
never meant to feel this way
dont wanna be
alone tonight

to make you mine
falling so hard
so fast this time

and i start to tremble

that i resemble
i cannot pretend
that we can still be friends
dont wanna be
alone tonight

the rest of my life
