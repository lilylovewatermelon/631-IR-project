i spend the night yeah doing ninety in a sixtyfive
ignore the lights til im by your side
because when you take this out on me my knees get weak
with that heart of kryptonite

chorus 1
i stole the moon
i made the stars align
and i showed you how to fly
and you made me the bad guy

verse 2
you paint the scene yeah with the colors of an enemy
all over me for your friends to see
i took just one misstep and now im hanging by my feet
out of sight and out of reach

chorus 1
i stole the moon
i made the stars align
i showed you how to fly
and you made me the bad guy

chorus 2
i fought for you
i kept you safe at night
i would have risked my life
and you made me the bad guy
you might also likeone two three go

bridge
you made me the bad guy
you made me the bad guy
yeah you made me the bad guy

guess i forgot guess i forgot
history repeats
once lost and found once lost and found
were too blind to see
just show me how just show me how the villain was me

chorus 1
when i stole the moon
i made the stars align
i showed you how to fly
and you made me the bad guy

chorus 2
when i fought for you
i kept you safe at night
i would have risked my life
and you made me the bad guy

outro
