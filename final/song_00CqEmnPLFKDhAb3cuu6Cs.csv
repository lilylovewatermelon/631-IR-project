every time i get away you find a way to reel me back in aah
tell me that you love me hold me tight so we can always be friends aah

every time i get away you find a way to pull me back in aah

you knew i couldnt help myself
i had to lay low
got so high couldnt help myself
i lost my halo

took me by the hand and said remember all the good times we had aah
i remember how you took my favorite knife and slipped it under my skin aah
i swear i said it before and ill say it again aah
every time i get away you find a way back under my skin
