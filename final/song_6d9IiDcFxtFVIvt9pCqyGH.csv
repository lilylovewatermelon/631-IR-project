the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and im a house of cards
youre the kind of reckless that should send me runnin
but i kinda know that i wont get far
and you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldnt see what i was thinkin of

chorus
drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

verse 2
my mind forgets to remind me youre a bad idea
you touch me once and its really somethin
you find im even better than you imagined i would be
im on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know its no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would

chorus
drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keepin your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase wont you whisper soft and slow
im captivated by you baby like a firework show

chorus
drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk ahah take away the pain
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

outro
and the sparks fly
oh baby smile
