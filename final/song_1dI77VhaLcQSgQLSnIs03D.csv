if you wanna run away with me i know a galaxy
and i can take you for a ride
i had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
where the music dont stop for life
glitter in the sky glitter in my eyes
shining just the way i like
if youre feeling like you need a little bit of company
you met me at the perfect time

prechorus
you want me i want you baby
my sugarboo im levitating
the milky way were renegading
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

chorus
i got you moonlight youre my starlight
i need you all night come on dance with me
im levitating
you moonlight youre my starlight youre the moonlight
i need you all night come on dance with me
im levitating

verse 2
i believe that youre for me i feel it in our energy
i see us written in the stars
we can go wherever so lets do it now or never
baby nothings ever ever too far
glitter in the sky glitter in our eyes
shining just the way we are
i feel like were forever every time we get together
but whatever lets get lost on mars
