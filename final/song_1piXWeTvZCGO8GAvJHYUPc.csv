see that’s the thing with you plastics you think everybody is in love with you when actually everybody hates you

cady spoken
you made me like this it was your idea for me to pretend to be plastic

janis
buddy it’s not pretend
you are as plastic as they come
you think your shit dont stink
you think the rest of us are dumb

i hate regina’s guts
but here’s what you dont comprehend
at least she has the guts
to not pretend to be my friend
