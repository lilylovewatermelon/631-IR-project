verse 1 jelly roll
i heard that the liquor and a bag of bud
helps me forget what my problems was
i need a buzz i need some love
i need a little something that can pick me up
light it up and get so high
feel like i can kiss the sky
and i heard youre so low
so i dont explode
how can i continue when im dealing with these issues
put my problеms in the paper and i roll em up
aint no sеnse in me stressing ill just have another session
tell em i dont give a fuck ill take another puff
feel like ive been kicked and bruised
feel like im at the bottom aint got shit to lose
been flipped and fooled fuck it ive been tricked and used
this shit was cool until somebody lit the fuse

eyes half shut
windows down with my middle fingers up with my middle fingers up
im so sick of bad luck bad luck
fuck the world let me roll one up let me roll one up
its just one of those days its just one of those days
that i dont give a fuck that i dont give a fuck
its just one of those days its just one of those days
that i dont give a fuck that i dont give a fuck

verse 2 chris webby
listen
tryna tell myself that shit getting better
but got them demons in my mind its like my head is forever
with this depression at the center of my mental ive entered
into a new dimension where there aint a day of sunny weather
tried to pull myself up out of it with shit that im taking
with no prescription written in the  of medication
with these downers when im down its a hell of a combination
and im filling up with stimulants to keep my concentration
and ive been fighting with my lady a lot
i cant even tell whos fault it is most of the time
got these voices in my head praying they stop
got me crushing down pills and im blowing a line with rolled 20s
thinking back when i had no money
now i got it all but still feel like theres nobody
who could ever understand what i feel inside
but im a phoenix so still i rise it wont stop me
