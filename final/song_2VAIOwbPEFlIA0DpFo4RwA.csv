forgiving my mistakes
getting her to love me
was my biggest break
every place i go shes inside of me
giving up her love unconditionally

she shines the sun
she pours the rain
she touches me in places that i cant explain
shes got a powerful hold on me
the kind of hold from which id never struggle free

tell me what you know
tell me is it true
do you really love me just like i love you
everything i say
everything i do
its purely cos im aiming to get hold of you

people tell her she could do better than me
she wouldnt necessarily agree
weve got a thing going on you see
the two of us together for eternity

tenderly she smiles
forgiving my mistakes
getting her to love me
was my biggest break
every place i go shes inside of me
giving up her love unconditionallysee ub40 liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
