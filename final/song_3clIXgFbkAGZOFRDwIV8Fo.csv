claim what’s yours or let it slip away
got to lead with a heart
commit to full potential let the healing start
look inside there’s a light
go headlong through the fog while innovation guides
place it all on the line
dive in to the depths of boundless might
i am the setting sun
and the dawning of the day
you are a turn of wind
and the sands of time and space
unbound by old belief
do we dare face our fears
drop all guards
and set ourselves free
to live is to die is to be reborn
glory glory
to live is to die is to be reborn
glory glory
glory now glory
glory glory now x3
i am the setting sun
and the dawning of the day
you are a turn of wind
and the sands of time and space
unbound by past belief
do we dare face our fears
drop all guards
and set ourselves free
set ourselves free x4you might also likeembed"
