i wore makeup when we dated
cause i thought youd like me more
if i looked like the other prom queens
i know that you loved before
tried so hard to be everything that you liked
just for you to say youre not the compliment type

verse 2
and i knew how you took your coffee
and your favorite songs by heart
i read all of your selfhelp books
so youd think that i was smart
stupid emotional obsessive little me
i knew from the start this is exactly how youd leave

chorus
you found someonе more exciting the nеxt second you were gone
and you left me there cryin wonderin what i did wrong
and you always say im never satisfied but i dont think thats true
cause all i ever wanted was to be enough for you
yeah all i ever wanted was to be enough for you

verse 3
and maybe im just not as interesting
as the girls you had before
but god you couldnt have cared less
about someone who loved you more
id say you broke my heart
but you broke much more than that
now i dont want your sympathy
i just want myself back

before you found someone more exciting the next second you were gone
and you left me there cryin wonderin what i did wrong
and you always say im never satisfied but i dont think thats true
cause all i ever wanted was to be enough

bridge
and dont you think i loved you too much
to be used and discarded
dont you think i loved you too much
to think i deserve nothing
but dont tell me youre sorry boy
feel sorry for yourself
cause someday ill be everything to somebody else

outro
and theyll think that i am so exciting
and youll be the one whos crying
yeah you always say im never satisfied but i dont think thats true
you say im never satisfied but thats not me its you
cause all i ever wanted was to be enough
but i dont think anything could ever be enough for you
enough for you oh
no nothings enough for you55embed"
