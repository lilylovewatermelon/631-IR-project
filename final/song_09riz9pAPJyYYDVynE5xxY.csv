verse 1 anthony mars
yo light that cigarette im trippin
ash it on my bitches
taking my dose i never skip it
still in my hood up pistol gripping
still got a hundred blunts
got that bape up in my cup
stay with a bitch in the cut
who stay with my dick in her guts yeah
wetto the king of the grey
self park i dont fuck with the valet sheesh
private jet fuck a delay
went to paris and back in a day
okay no im never okay
bitch stop asking
came up and supported my family
just for that thеy should give me a grammy uh
running and ducking the slammеr uh
thinking bout cocking the hammer
the lights the glitter the glamour uh
none of this shit even matter
none of this shit made me happy
wound up in rehab instead of a casket
locking me up and they had the rooms padded
made a straitjacket my fashion
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 norman atomic
ruby da motherfucker grim reaping im undercover
soul seeking i found another bitch whos thinking that im her lover no
reason i keep on shrugging blunt is cashed lets keep em coming
only weed keeps me from bugging and from seeking out more destruction
im a pro at selfdoubt but i doubt ill ever know
that these bitches want me to fly em out just because i upped the glow
all these fuckboys wanna be me but they keep it on the low
and talk shit about me and my cousin while were thumbing through our dough
all this fame is such a curse sometimes i wish i was a ghost
watch me raise the fucking dead next time im on stage at a show
