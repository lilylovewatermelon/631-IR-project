to answer the question itll probably take more
if youre already there well you probably dont know
well we were the people that we wanted to know
and were the places that we wanted to go
its hard to get hold of and hard to let go
always something wed look for from the day we were born
instead were the people that we wanted to know

refrain
and were the places that we wanted to go
and were the places that we wanted to go
and were the places that we wanted to go

verse 2
always asking a question and i dont want to know
like the wind across strings that had finally let go
and the people you love but you didnt quite know
theyre the places that you wanted to go

bark at the neighbors and then bark at the door
asnifflin and wimperin for someone to know
but we were the people that we wanted to know

refrain
and were the places that we wanted to go
yeah were the places that we wanted to go
yeah were the places that we wanted to go

i hardly have people that i needed to know
cause youre the people that i wanted to know
all this scramblin around huntin high and then low
lookin for the face love or somewhere to go
i hardly have places that i needed to go

chorus
cause youre the places that i wanted to go
yeah youre the places that we wanted to go
yeah youre the places that we wanted to go
