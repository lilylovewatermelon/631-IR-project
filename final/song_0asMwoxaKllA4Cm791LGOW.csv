call me when they bury bodies underwater
its blue light over murder for me
crumble like a temple built from future daughters
to wasteland when the oceans recede
merry in the morning earn your bitter fodder
its easier to try not to eat
so flood me like atlantic bandage up the trenches
anything to get me to sleep

verse 2
i woke up surrounded eyes like frozen planets
just orbiting the vacuum i am
they talk me through the damage consequence
and how its a pain they know they dont understand
sobbing as they turn to statues at the bedside
im trying not to crush into sand
so flood me like atlantic weather me to nothing
wash away the blood on my hands

verse 3
call me when they bury bodies underwater
its blue light over murder for me
crumble like a temple built from future daughters
to wasteland when the oceans recede

dont wake me
dont wake me
dont wake me up
dont you wake me up
dont wake me
dont wake me
dont wake me up2embed"
