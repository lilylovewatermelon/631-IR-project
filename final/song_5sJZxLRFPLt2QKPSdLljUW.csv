there was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a merchant who dwelt in the land of bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore but in due time allah the allhearing the allknowing decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the most high so he died and his two sons laid him out and buried him after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shopfn6 presently the elder son hasan hight a youth of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace betook himself to the company of lewd folk women and low boys frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done for that he exulted in the abundance of his good after some time he had wasted all his ready money so he sold all his fathers lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing neither little nor muchel nor was one of his comrades left who knew him he abode thus anhungred he and his widowed mother three days and on the fourth day as he walked along unknowing whither to wend there met him a man of his fathers friends who questioned him of his case he told him what had befallen him and the other said o my son i have a brother who is a goldsmith an thou wilt thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother to whom he commended him saying in very sooth this is my son do thou teach him for my sake so hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft and allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself one day as he sat in his booth in the bazar there came up to him an ajamí a foreigner a persian with a great white beard and a white turbandfn7 on his head having the semblance of a merchant who after saluting him looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly it pleased him and he shook his head saying by allah thou art a cunning goldsmith what may be thy name hasan replied the other shortlyfn8 the persian continued to look at his wares whilst hasan read in an old bookfn9 he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace till the hour of midafternoon prayer when the shop became clear of people and the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth what book is that thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and seventyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world many have sought of me instruction therein but i consented not to instruct any of them in it yet hath my soul consented that i teach it to thee for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and i will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvilfn10 charcoal and fire hasan asked o my lord and when wilt thou teach me this and the persian answered tomorrow inshallah i will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper whereupon hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the persian till nightfall when he took leave of him and going in to his mother saluted her with the salam and ate with her but he was dazed without memory or reason for that the strangers words had gotten hold upon his heart so she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the persian which when she heard her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom saying o my son beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk and especially of the persians and obey them not in aught for they are sharpers and tricksters who profess the art of alchemyfn11 and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain replied hasan o my mother we are paupers and have nothing he may covet that he should put a cheat on us indeed this persian is a right worthy shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son she was silent in her chagrin and he passed the night without sleep his heart being full of what the persian had said to him nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein but when morning morrowed he rose and taking the keys opened the shop whereupon behold the persian accosted him hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands but he forbade him from this and suffered it not saying o hasan set on the crucible and apply the bellowsfn12 so he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal then said the persian o my son hast thou any copper and he replied i have a broken platter so he bade him work the shearsfn13 and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows till the copper became liquid when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow kohl or eyepowderfn14 then he bade hasan blow upon it with the bellows and he did so till the contents of the crucible became a lump of goldfn15 when the youth saw this he was stupefied and at his wits end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the persians hand to kiss it but he forbade him saying art thou married and when the youth replied no he said carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not so hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold so they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhamsfn16 at which price he sold it and taking the money went home and told his mother all that had passed saying o my mother i have learnt this art and mystery but she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightieth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the ajami and cried i have learnt this art and mystery she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and she was silent for vexation then of his ignorance he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop laid it before the persian who was still sitting there and asked him o my son what wilt thou do with this mortar hasan answered let us put it in the fire and make of it lumps of gold the persian laughed and rejoined o my son art thou jinnmad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost now o my son an i teach thee this craft thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth for that will suffice thee from year to year cried hasan true o my lord and sitting down in his open shop set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire quoth the persian what wilt thou o my son and quoth hasan teach me this craft there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed the persian laughing verily o my son thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars if we busy ourselves with it here the folk will say of us these practise alchemy and the magistrates will hear of us and we shall lose our livesfn17 wherefore o my son an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright come thou with me to my house so hasan barred his shop and went with that ajamí but by the way he remembered his mothers words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still with bowed head the persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him art thou mad what i in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest i will harm thee presently adding but if thou fear to go with me to my house i will go with thee to thine and teach thee there hasan replied tis well o uncle and the persian rejoined go thou before me so hasan led the way to his own house and entering told his mother of the persians coming for he had left him standing at the door she ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it her son bade her go to one of the neighbours lodgings so she left her home to them and wended her way whereupon hasan brought in the persian who entered after asking leave then he took in hand a dish and going to the market returned with food which he set before the persian saying eat o my lord that between us there may be bread and salt and may almighty allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt the persian replied with a smile true o my son who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and saltfn18 then he came forward and ate with hasan till they were satisfied after which the ajami said o my son hasan bring us somewhat of sweetmeats so hasan went to the market rejoicing in his words and returned with ten saucersfn19 of sweetmeats of which they both ate and the persian said may allah abundantly requite thee o my son it is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit himfn20 then said he o hasan bring the gear but hardly did hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in springtide and hastening to the shop fetched the apparatus and set it before the persian who pulled out a piece of paper and said o hasan by the bond of bread and salt wert thou not dearer to me than my son i would not let thee into the mysteries of this art for i have none of the elixirfn21 left save what is in this paper but by and by i will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee know o my son hasan that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold presently adding o my son o hasan there are in this paper three ouncesfn22 egyptian measure and when it is spent i will make thee other and more hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder finer than the first said to the persian o my lord what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made but he laughed longing to get hold of the youth and replied of what dost thou question indeed thou art a froward boy do thy work and hold thy peace so hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house shore it in shreds and threw it into the meltingpot then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold when he saw this he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold but whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the meltingpot the persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of cretan bhang which if an elephant smelt he would sleep from night to night and cutting off a little thereof put it in a piece of the sweetmeat then said he o hasan thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth and i have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace now i see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee wherefore if it be allahs will i will marry thee to her replied hasan i am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the almighty and the persian rejoined o my son have fair patience and fair shall betide thee therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand put it in his mouth knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the lord of futurity knoweth the future but hardly had he swallowed it when he fell down head foregoing heels and was lost to the world whereupon the persian seeing him in such calamitous case rejoiced exceedingly and cried thou hast fallen into my snares o gallowscarrion o dog of the arabs this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee o hasan—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightyfirst night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the ajami and fell fainting to the ground the persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee then he girt himself and pinioned hasans arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him moreover he cleared another chest and laying therein all hasans valuables together with the piece of the first goldlump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock then he ran to the market and fetching a porter took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city where he set them down on the seashore hard by a vessel at anchor there now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the persian and her master was awaiting him so when the crew saw him they came to him and bore the two chests on board then the persian called out to the rais or captain saying up and let us be off for i have done my desire and won my wish so the skipper sang out to the sailors saying weigh anchor and set sail and the ship put out to sea with a fair wind so far concerning the persian but as regards hasans mother she awaited him till suppertime but heard neither sound nor news of him so she went to the house and finding it thrown open entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying alas my son ah alas the fruit of my vitals ah and she recited these couplets

my patience fails me and grows anxiety  and with your absence
       nbsp     growth of grief i see
by allah patience went what time ye went  loss of all hope how
       nbsp     suffer patiently
when lost my loved one how can joy i sleep  who shall enjoy
       nbsp     such life of low degree
thou rt gone and desolating house and home  hast fouled the
       nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free
thou wast my fame my grace mid folk my stay  mine aid wast
       nbsp     thou in all adversity
perish the day when from mine eyes they bore  my friend till
       nbsp     sight i thy return to me
and she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son and she told them what had befallen him with the persian assured that she should never never see him again then she went round about the house weeping and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall so she sent for a scholar who read them to her and they were these

leylas phantom came by night when drowsiness had overcome me
       nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the
       nbsp     desert
but when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom i saw the air
       nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distantfn23

when hasans mother heard these lines she shrieked and said yes o my son indeed the house is desolate and the visitationplace is distant then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son went away but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write hasans name and the date of his loss and thenceforward she quitted it not but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day such was her case but touching her son hasan and the ajami this persian was a magian who hated moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power he was a lewd and filthy villain a hankerer after alchemy an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards such an one as he of whom quoth the poet

a dog dogfathered by doggrandsire bred  no good in dog
       nbsp     from dog race issued

       nbsp     seed by all men shedfn24

the name of this accursed was bahrám the guebre and he was wont every year to take a moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes so when he had carried out his plot against hasan the goldsmith they sailed on from dawn till dark when the ship made fast to the shore for the night and at sunrise when they set sail again bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were hasan they did so and he opened it and taking out the young man made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils hasan sneezed and vomited the bhang then opening his eyes he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail and saw the persian sitting by him wherefore he knew that the accursed magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him so he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer to wit there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verity we are allahs and unto him we are returning o my god be thou gracious to me in thine appointment and give me patience to endure this thine affliction o lord of the three worlds then he turned to the persian and bespoke him softly saying o my father what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to mefn25 but bahram stared at him and replied o dog knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt i have slain of youths like thee a thousand save one and thou shalt make up the thousand and he cried out at him and hasan was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightysecond night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the ajami cried out at him in wrath so he was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him then the accursed bade loose his pinionbonds and they gave him a little water to drink whilst the magian laughed and said by the virtue of the fire and the light and the shade and the heat methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets but the fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee that i might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice to herfn26 so she may accept of me quoth hasan thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt whereupon the magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and biting the deck with his foreteeth swooned away whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks then the guebre bade his servants light him a fire and hasan said what wilt thou do with it replied the magian this is the fire lady of light and sparkles bright this it is i worship and if thou wilt worship her even as i verily i will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter thereupon hasan cried angrily at him woe to thee thou art a miscreant magian who to fire dost pray in lieu of the king of omnipotent sway creator of night and day and this is naught but a calamity among creeds at this the magian was wroth and said to him wilt thou not then conform with me o dog of the arabs and enter my faith but hasan consented not to this so the accursed guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire bade his pages throw him flat on his face they did so and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongsfn27 till his flanks were laid open whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him and besought protection but none protected him then he raised his eyes to the allpowerful king and sought of him succour in the name of the chosen prophet and indeed patience failed him his tears ran down his cheeks like rain and he repeated these couplets twain

in patience o my god thy doom forecast  ill bear an thereby
       nbsp     come thy grace at last
theyve dealt us wrong transgressed and ordered ill  haply thy
       nbsp    grace shall pardon what is past
then the magian bade his negroslaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink so they sat food before him but he consented not to eat or drink and bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage whilst hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before almighty allah to whom belong honour and glory whereby the guebres heart was hardened against him they ceased not to sail the sea three months during which time hasan was continually tortured till allah almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship by reason of the fierce gale whereupon quoth the captain and crewfn28 by allah this is all on account of yonder youth who hath been these three months in torture with this magian indeed this is not allowed of god the most high then they rose against the magian and slew his servants and all who were with him which when he saw he made sure of death and feared for himself so he loosed hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on clad him in others and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land saying o my son return me not evil for that i have done with thee quoth hasan how can i ever rely upon thee again and quoth bahram o my son but for sin there were no pardon indeed i did all these doings with thee but to try thy patience and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of allah so the crew and captain rejoiced in hasans release and he called down blessings on them and praised the almighty and thanked him with this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage then said hasan to bahram o masterfn29 whither wendest thou replied the magian o my son i am bound for the mountain of clouds where is the elixir which we use in alchemy and the guebre swore to him by the fire and the light that he had no longer any cause to fear him so hasans heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the persians words he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the magian who clad him in his own raiment they ceased not sailing on other three months when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles white and yellow and skyblue and black and every other hue and the magian sprang up and said o hasan come let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will so hasan rose and landed with bahram after the persian had commended his goods to the captains care they walked on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight when bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettledrumfn30 of copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste hasan marvelled at the magians doings and was afraid of him he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed but bahram looked at him and said what aileth thee o my son by the truth of the fire and the light thou hast naught to fear from me and were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means i had not brought thee ashore so rejoice in all good for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightythird night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian said to hasan in very sooth yonder dustcloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof presently the dust lifted off three shedromedaries one of which bahram mounted and hasan another then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days till they came to a wide champaign and descending into its midst they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold so they alighted and entering thereunder ate and drank and took their rest anon hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the magian what is that o nuncle bahram replied tis a palace and quoth hasan wilt thou not go thither that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it but the persian was wroth and said name not to me yonder palace for therein dwelleth a foe with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee then he beat the kettledrum and up came the dromedaries and they mounted and fared on other seven days on the eighth day the magian said o hasan what seest thou hasan replied i see clouds and mists twixt east and west quoth bahram that is neither clouds nor mists but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds splitfn31 and there are no clouds above it for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek tis for that i brought thee hither for my wish may not be won save at thy hands hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the magian by the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest i conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me bahram replied the art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and i purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it and when we have it i will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn hasan answered in his fear tis well o my master and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets

consider but thy lord his work shall bring  comfort to thee
       nbsp   with quick relief and near
despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane  in bane how many
       nbsp   blessed boons appear

they ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted and hasan saw thereon a palace and asked bahram what be yonder palace whereto he answered tis the abode of the jann and ghuls and satans then the magian alighted and making hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him bear me no ill will anent that i did with thee for i will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace and i conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom and i and thou will share equally therein and hasan replied to hear is to obey then bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap whereupon up came the dromedaries he chose out one and said hearken o my son o hasan to what i am about to enjoin on thee and hasan replied tis well bahram continued lie down on this skin and i will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground whereupon the rakham birdsfn32 will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountaintop take this knife with thee and when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down slit open therewith the skin and come forth the vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me and i will tell thee what to do so he sewed him up in the skin placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water and withdrew to a distance presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up flew away with him to the mountaintop and there set him down as soon as hasan felt himself on the ground he slit the skin and coming forth called out to the magian who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy saying to him look behind thee and tell me what thou seest hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood told bahram who said to him this be what we need and seek make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me for this is wherewithal we do alchemy so he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to hasan o gallows bird i have won my wish of thee and now if thou wilt thou mayst abide on this mountain or cast thyself down to the earth and perish so saying he left himfn33 and went away and hasan exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this hound hath played the traitor with me and he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets

when god upon a man possessed of reasoning hearing and sight
       nbsp   his will in aught to pass would bring
he stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit from
       nbsp    him as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling
till his decrees fulfilled he gives him back his wit that
       nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing
so say thou not of aught that haps how happened it for fate
       nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everythingfn34
—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightyfourth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the magian sent hasan to the mountaintop and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this damned hound hath played the traitor then he rose to his feet and looked right and left after which he walked on along the mountain top in mind making certain of death he fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain along which he saw a darkblue sea dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount so he sat down and repeated what he might of the koran and besought allah the most high to ease him of his troubles or by death or by deliverance from such strait then he recited for himself the funeralprayerfn35 and cast himself down into the main but the waves bore him up by allahs grace so that he reached the water unhurt and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him so that the billows bore him safe to land by the decree of the most high thereupon he rejoiced and praised almighty allah and thanked him after which he walked on in quest of something to eat for stress of hunger and came presently to the place where he had halted with the magian bahram then he fared on awhile till behold he caught sight of a great palace rising high in air and knew it for that of which he had questioned the persian and he had replied therein dwelleth a foe of mine hasan said to himself by allah needs must i enter yonder palace perchance relief awaiteth me there so coming to it and finding the gate open he entered the vestibule where he saw seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chesscloth before them and they were at play one of them raised her head to him and cried out for joy saying by allah here is a son of adam and methinks tis he whom bahram the magian brought hither this year so hasan hearing her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and said yes o my ladies by allah i am indeed that unhappy then said the younger damsel to her elder sister bear witness against mefn36 o my sister that this is my brother by covenant of allah and that i will die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn for his mourning so saying she rose and embraced him and kissed him and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her led him into the palace where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a suit of kings raiment wherewith she arrayed him moreover she made ready all manner viandsfn37 and set them before him and sat and ate with him she and her sister then said they to him tell us thy tale with yonder dog the wicked the wizard from the time of thy falling into his hands to that of thy freeing thee from him and after we will tell thee all that hath passed between us and him so thou mayst be on thy guard against him an thou see him again hearing these words and finding himself thus kindly received hasan took heart of grace and reason returned to him and he related to them all that had befallen him with the magian from first to last then they asked didst thou ask him of this palace and he answered yes but he said name it not to me for it belongeth to ghuls and satans at this the two damsels waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said did that miscreant style us ghuls and satans and hasan answered yes cried the younger sister by allah i will assuredly do him die with the foulest death and make him to lack the wind of the world quoth hasan and how wilt thou get at him to kill him for he is a crafty magician and quoth she he is in a garden by name almushayyadfn38 and there is no help but that i slay him before long then said her sister sooth spake hasan in everything he hath recounted to us of this cur but now tell him our tale that all of it may abide in his memory so the younger said to him know o my brother that we are the daughters of a king of the mightiest kings of the jann having marids for troops and guards and servants and almighty allah blessed him with seven daughters by one wife but of his folly such jealousy and stiffneckedness and pride beyond compare gat hold upon him that he would not give us in marriage to any one and summoning his wazirs and emirs he said to them can ye tell me of any place untrodden by the tread of men and jinn and abounding in trees and fruits and rills and quoth they what wilt thou therewith o king of the age and quoth he i desire there to lodge my seven daughters answered they o king the place for them is the castle of the mountain of clouds built by an ifrit of the rebellious jinn who revolted from the covenant of our lord solomon on whom be the peace since his destruction none hath dwelt there nor man nor jinni for tis cut offfn39 and none may win to it and the castle is girt about with trees and fruits and rills and the water running around it is sweeter than honey and colder than snow none who is afflicted with leprosy or elephantiasisfn40 or what not else drinketh thereof but he is healed forthright hearing this our father sent us hither with an escort of his troops and guards and provided us with all that we need here when he is minded to ride to us he beateth a kettledrum whereupon all his hosts present themselves before him and he chooseth whom he shall ride and dismisseth the rest but when he desireth that we shall visit him he commandeth his followers the enchanters to fetch us and carry us to the presence so he may solace himself with our society and we accomplish our desire of him after which they again carry us back hither our five other sisters are gone ahunting in our desert wherein are wild beasts past compt or calculation and it being our turn to do this we two abode at home to make ready for them food indeed we had besought allah extolled and exalted be he to vouchsafe us a son of adam to cheer us with his company and praised be he who hath brought thee to us so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for no harm shall befal thee hasan rejoiced and said alhamdolillah laud to the lord who guideth us into the path of deliverance and inclineth hearts to us then his sisterfn41 rose and taking him by the hand led him into a private chamber where she brought out to him linen and furniture that no mortal can avail unto presently the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with hasans case whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety then he abode with them in all the solace of life and its joyance riding out with them to the chase and taking his pleasure with them whilst they entreated him courteously and cheered him with converse till his sadness ceased from him and he recovered health and strength and his body waxed stout and fat by dint of fair treatment and pleasant time among the seven moons in that fair palace with its gardens and flowers for indeed he led the delightsomest of lives with the damsels who delighted in him and he yet more in them and they used to give him drink of the honeydew of their lipsfn42 these beauties with the high bosoms adorned with grace and loveliness the perfection of brilliancy and in shape very symmetry moreover the youngest princess told her sisters how bahram the magian had made them of the ghuls and demons and satansfn43 and they sware that they would surely slay him next year the accursed guebre again made his appearance having with him a handsome young moslem as he were the moon bound hand and foot and tormented with grievous tortures and alighted with him below the palacewalls now hasan was sitting under the trees by the side of the stream and when he espied bahram his heart flutteredfn44 his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
when it was the seven hundred and eightyfifth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith saw the magian his heart fluttered his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand then he said to the princesses o my sisters help me to the slaughter of this accursed for here he is come back and in your grasp and he leadeth with him captive a young moslem of the sons of the notables whom he is torturing with all manner grievous torments lief would i kill him and console my heart of him and by delivering the young moslem from his mischief and restoring him to his country and kith and kin and friends fain would i lay up merit for the world to come by taking my wreak of himfn45 this will be an almsdeed from you and ye will reap the reward thereof from almighty allah we hear and we obey allah and thee o our brother o hasan replied they and binding chinveils armed themselves and slung on their swords after which they brought hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons then they all sallied out and found the magian who had slaughtered and skinned a camel illusing the young moslem and saying to him sit thee in this hide so hasan came behind him without his knowledge and cried out at him till he was dazed and amazed then he came up to him saying hold thy hand o accursed o enemy of allah and foe of the moslems o dog o traitor o thou that flame dost obey o thou that walkest in the wicked ones ways worshipping the fire and the light and swearing by the shade and the heat herewith the magian turned and seeing hasan thought to wheedle him and said to him o my son how diddest thou escape and who brought thee down to earth hasan replied he delivered me who hath appointed the taking of thy life to be at my hand and i will torture thee even as thou torturedst me the whole way long o miscreant o atheistfn46 thou hast fallen into the twist and the way thou hast missed and neither mother shall avail thee nor brother nor friend nor solemn covenant shall assist thee for thou saidst o accursed whoso betrayeth bread and salt may allah do vengeance upon him and thou hast broken the bond of bread and salt wherefore the almighty hath thrown thee into my grasp and far is thy chance of escape from me rejoined bahram by allah o my son o hasan thou art dearer to me than my sprite and the light of mine eyes but hasan stepped up to him and hastily smote him between the shoulders that the sword issued gleaming from his throattendons and allah hurried his soul to the fire and abidingplace dire then hasan took the magians bag and opened it then having taken out the kettledrum he struck it with the strap whereupon up came the dromedaries like lightning so he unbound the youth from his bonds and setting him on one of the camels loaded him another with victual and waterfn47 saying wend whither thou wilt so he departed after almighty allah had thus delivered him from his strait at the hands of hasan when the damsels saw their brother slay the magian they joyed in him with exceeding joy and gat round him marvelling at his valour and prowessfn48 and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his safety saying o hasan thou hast done a deed whereby thou hast healed the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the king of omnipotence then they returned to the palace and he abode with them eating and drinking and laughing and making merry and indeed his sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his motherfn49 but while he led with them this goodly life one day behold there arose from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened the welkin and made towards them when the princess saw this they said to him rise o hasan run to thy chamber and conceal thyself or an thou wilt go down into the garden and hide thyself among the trees and vines but fear not for no harm shall befal thee so he arose and entering his chamber locked the door upon himself and lay lurking in the palace presently the dust opened out and showed beneath it a great conquering host as it were a surging sea coming from the king the father of the damsels now when the troops reached the castle the princesses received them with all honour and hospitably entertained them three days after which they questioned them of their case and tidings and they replied saying we come from the king in quest of you they asked and what would the king with us and the officers answered one of the kings maketh a marriage festival and your father would have you be present thereat and take your pleasure therewith the damsels enquired and how long shall we be absent from our place and they rejoined the time to come and go and to sojourn may be two months so the princesses arose and going in to the palace sought hasan acquainted him with the case and said to him verily this place is thy place and our house is thy house so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and feel nor grief nor fear for none can come at thee here but keep a good heart and a glad mind till we return to thee the keys of our chambers we leave with thee but o our brother we beseech thee by the bond of brotherhood in very deed not to open such a door for thou hast no need thereto then they farewelled him and fared forth with the troops leaving hasan alone in the palace it was not long before his breast grew straitened and his patience shortened solitude and sadness were heavy on him and he sorrowed for his severance from them with passing chagrin the palace for all its vastness waxed small to him and finding himself sad and solitary he bethought him of the damsels and their pleasant converse and recited these couplets

the wide plain is narrowed before these eyes  and the landscape
       nbsp     troubles this heart of mine
since my friends went forth by the loss of them  joy fled and
       nbsp     these eyelids rail floods of brine
sleep shunned these eyeballs for parting woe  and my mind is
       nbsp    worn with sore pain and pine
would i wot an time shall rejoin our lots  and the joys of love
       nbsp    with nighttalk combine
—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the departure of the damsels hasan sat in the palace sad and solitary and his breast was straitened by severance he used to ride forth ahunting by himself in the wold and bring back the game and slaughter it and eat thereof alone but melancholy and disquiet redoubled on him by reason of his loneliness so he arose and went round about the palace and explored its every part he opened the princesses apartments and found therein riches and treasures fit to ravish the beholders reason but he delighted not in aught thereof by reason of their absence his heart was fired by thinking of the door they had charged him not to approach or open on any account and he said in himself my sister had never enjoined me not to open this door except there were behind it somewhat whereof she would have none to know but by allah i will arise and open it and see what is within though within it were sudden death then he took the key and opening the doorfn50 saw therein no treasure but he espied a vaulted and winding staircase of yamani onyx at the upper end of the chamber so he mounted the stair which brought him out upon the terrace roof of the palace whence he looked down upon the gardens and vergiers full of trees and fruits and beasts and birds warbling praises of allah the one the allpowerful and said in himself this is that they forbade to me he gazed upon these pleasaunces and saw beyond a surging sea dashing with clashing billows and he ceased not to explore the palace right and left till he ended at a pavilion builded with alternate courses two bricks of gold and one of silver and jacinth and emerald and supported by four columns and in the centre he saw a sitting room paved and lined with a mosaic of all manner precious stones such as rubies and emeralds and balasses and other jewels of sorts and in its midst stood a basinfn51 brimful of water over which was a trelliswork of sandalwood and aloeswood reticulated with rods of red gold and wands of emerald and set with various kinds of jewels and fine pearls each sized as a pigeons egg the trellis was covered with a climbing vine bearing grapes like rubies and beside the basin stood a throne of lignaloes latticed with red gold inlaid with great pearls and comprising varicoloured gems of every sort and precious minerals each kind fronting each and symmetrically disposed about it the birds warbled with sweet tongues and various voices celebrating the praises of allah the most high brief it was a palace such as nor cæsar nor chosroës ever owned but hasan saw therein none of the creatures of allah whereat he marvelled and said in himself i wonder to which of the kings this place pertaineth or is it manycolumned iram whereof they tell for who among mortals can avail to the like of this and indeed he was amazed at the spectacle and sat down in the pavilion and cast glances around him marvelling at the beauty of its ordinance and at the lustre of the pearls and jewels and the curious works which therein were no less than at the gardens and orchards aforesaid and at the birds that hymned the praises of allah the one the almighty and he abode pondering the traces of him whom the most high had enabled to rear that structure for indeed he is muchel of mightfn52 and presently behold he espied ten birdsfn53 flying towards the pavilion from the heart of the desert and knew that they were making the palace and bound for the basin to drink of its waters so he hid himself for fear they should see him and take flight they lighted on a great tree and a goodly and circled round about it and he saw amongst them a bird of marvelbeauty the goodliest of them all and the nine stood around it and did it service and hasan marvelled to see it peck them with its bill and lord it over them while they fled from it he stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and perched on the couch after which each bird rent open its neckskin with its claws and issued out of it and lo it was but a garment of feathers and there came forth therefrom ten virgins maids whose beauty shamed the brilliancy of the moon they all doffed their clothes and plunging into the basin washed and fell to playing and sporting one with other whilst the chief bird of them lifted up the rest and ducked them down and they fled from her and dared not put forth their hands to her when hasan beheld her thus he took leave of his right reason and his sense was enslaved so he knew that the princesses had not forbidden him to open the door save because of this for he fell passionately in love with her for what he saw of her beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace as she played and sported and splashed the others with the water he stood looking upon them whilst they saw him not with eye gazing and heart burning and soulfn54 to evil prompting and he sighed to be with them and wept for longing because of the beauty and loveliness of the chief damsel his mind was amazed at her charms and his heart taken in the net of her love lowe was loosed in his heart for her sake and there waxed on him a flame whose sparks might not be quenched and desire whose signs might not be hidden presently they came up out of that basin whilst hasan marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the tokens of inner gifts in the elegance of their movements then he cast a glance at the chief damsel who stood mother naked and there was manifest to him what was between her thighs a goodly rounded dome on pillars borne like a bowl of silver or crystal which recalled to him the saying of the poetfn55

when i took up her shift and discovered the terraceroof of her
       nbsp     kaze i found it as strait as my humour or eke my worldly
       nbsp     ways
so i thrust it incontinent in halfway and she heaved a sigh
       nbsp    for what dost thou sigh quoth i for the rest of it
       nbsp    sure she says

then coming out of the water they all put on their dresses and ornaments and the chief maiden donned a green dressfn56 wherein she surpassed for loveliness all the fair ones of the world and the lustre of her face outshone the resplendent full moons she excelled the branches with the grace of her bending gait and confounded the wit with apprehension of disdain and indeed she was as saith the poetfn57

a maiden twas the dressers art had decked with cunning
       nbsp    sleight
the sun thou dst say had robbed her cheek and shone with
       nbsp    borrowed light
she came to us apparelled fair in under vest of green
like as the ripe pomegranate hides beneath its leafy screen
and when we asked her what might be the name of what she wore
she answered in a quaint reply that double meaning bore
the deserts heart we penetrate in such apparel dressed
and pierceheart therefore is the name by which we call the
       nbsp     vest

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightyseventh night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan saw the damsels issue forth the basin the chief maiden robbed his reason with her beauty and loveliness compelling him to recite the couplets forequoted and after dressing they sat talking and laughing whilst he stood gazing on them drowned in the sea of his love burning in the flames of passion and wandering in the wady of his melancholy thought and he said to himself by allah my sister forbade me not to open the door but for cause of these maidens and for fear lest i should fall in love with one of them how o hasan shalt thou woo and win them how bring down a bird flying in the vasty firmament by allah thou hast cast thyself into a bottomless sea and snared thyself in a net whence there is no escape i shall die desolate and none shall wot of my death and he continued to gaze on the charms of the chief damsel who was the loveliest creature allah had made in her day and indeed she outdid in beauty all human beings she had a mouth magical as solomons seal and hair blacker than the night of estrangement to the lovedespairing man her brow was bright as the crescent moon of the feast of ramazánfn58 and her eyes were like eyes wherewith gazelles scan she had a polished nose straight as a cane and cheeks like bloodred anemones of nuuman lips like coralline and teeth like strung pearls in carcanets of gold virgin to man and a neck like an ingot of silver above a shape like a wand of bán her middle was full of folds a dimpled plain such as enforceth the distracted lover to magnify allah and extol his might and main and her navelfn59 an ounce of musk sweetest of savour could contain she had thighs great and plump like marble columns twain or bolsters stuffed with down from ostrich taen and between them a somewhat as it were a hummock great of span or a hare with ears back lain while terraceroof and pilasters completed the plan and indeed she surpassed the bough of the myrobalan with her beauty and symmetry and the indian rattan for she was even as saith of them the poet whom love did unmanfn60

her lipdews rival honeysweets that sweet virginity 
       nbsp     keener than hindi scymitar the glance she casts at thee
she shames the bending bough of bán with graceful movement slow 
       nbsp     and as she smiles her teeth appear with levens brilliancy
when i compared with rose abloom the tintage of her cheeks 
       nbsp    she laughed in scorn and cried whoso compares with rosery
my hue and breasts granados terms is there no shame in him 
       nbsp    how should pomegranates bear on bough such fruit in form or
       nbsp    blee
now by my beauty and mine eyes and heart and eke by heaven 
       nbsp    of favours mine and by the hell of my unclemency
they say she is a gardenrose in very pride of bloom 
       nbsp   and yet no rose can ape my cheek nor branch my symmetry
if any garden own a thing which unto me is like 
       nbsp   what then is that he comes to crave of me and only me

they ceased not to laugh and play whilst hasan stood still awatching them forgetting meat and drink till near the hour of midafternoon prayer when the beauty the chief damsel said to her mates o kings daughters it waxeth late and our land is afar and we are weary of this stead come therefore let us depart to our own place so they all arose and donned their feather vests and becoming birds as they were before flew away all together with the chief lady in their midst then hasan despairing of their return would have arisen and gone down into the palace but could not move or even stand wherefore the tears ran down his cheeks and passion was sore on him and he recited these couplets

may god deny me boon of troth if i  after your absence sweets
       nbsp    of slumber know
yea since that sevrance never close mine eyes  nor rest
       nbsp     repose me since departed you
twould seem as though you saw me in your sleep  would heaven
       nbsp     the dreams of sleep were realtrue
indeed i dote on sleep though needed not  for sleep may bring
       nbsp    me that dear form to view

then hasan walked on little by little heeding not the way he went till he reached the foot of the stairs whence he dragged himself to his own chamber then he entered and shutting the door lay sick eating not nor drinking and drowned in the sea of his solitude he spent the night thus weeping and bemoaning himself till the morning and when it morrowed he repeated these couplets

the birds took flight at eve and winged their way  and sinless
       nbsp    he who died of loves deathblow
ill keep my lovetale secret while i can  but an desire
       nbsp    prevail its needs must show
night brought me nightly vision bright as dawn  while nights
       nbsp    of my desire lack morningglow
i mourn for themfn61 while they heartfreest sleep  and winds
       nbsp     of love on me their plaything blow
free i bestow my tears my wealth my heart  my wit my sprite
       nbsp     most gain who most bestow
the worst of woes and banes is enmity  beautiful maidens deal us
       nbsp     to our woe
favour they says forbidden to the fair  and shedding lovers
       nbsp     blood their laws allow
that naught can lovesicks do but lavish soul  and stake in
       nbsp    loveplay life on single throwfn62
i cry in longing ardour for my love  lover can only weep and
       nbsp    wail lovelowe

when the sun rose he opened the door went forth of the chamber and mounted to the stead where he was before then he sat down facing the pavilion and awaited the return of the birds till nightfall but they returned not wherefore he wept till he fell to the ground in a faintingfit when he came to after his swoon he dragged himself down the stairs to his chamber and indeed the darkness was come and straitened upon him was the whole world and he ceased not to weep and wail himself through the livelong night till the day broke and the sun rained over hill and dale its rays serene he ate not nor drank nor slept nor was there any rest for him but by day he was distracted and by night distressed with sleeplessness delirious and drunken with melancholy thought and excess of lovelonging and he repeated the verses of the lovedistraught poet

o thou who shamest sun in morning sheen  the branch
       nbsp     confounding yet with nescience blest
would heaven i wot an time shall bring return  and quench the
       nbsp     fires which flame unmanifest—
bring us together in a close embrace  thy cheek upon my cheek
       nbsp     thy breast abreast
who saith in love dwells sweetness when in love  are bitterer
       nbsp    days than aloësfn63 bitterest
—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightyeighty night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith felt love redouble upon him he recited those lines and as he abode thus in the stress of his lovedistraction alone and finding none to cheer him with company behold there arose a dustcloud from the desert wherefore he ran down and hid himself knowing that the princesses who owned the castle had returned before long the troops halted and dismounted round the palace and the seven damsels alighted and entering put off their arms and armour of war as for the youngest she stayed not to doff her weapons and gear but went straight to hasans chamber where finding him not she sought for him till she lighted on him in one of the sleeping closets hidden feeble and thin with shrunken body and wasted bones and indeed his colour was changed and his eyes sunken in his face for lack of food and drink and for much weeping by reason of his love and longing for the young lady when she saw him in this plight she was confounded and lost her wits but presently she questioned him of his case and what had befallen him saying tell me what aileth thee o my brother that i may contrive to do away thine affliction and i will be thy ransomfn64 whereupon he wept with sore weeping and by way of reply he began reciting

lover when parted from the thing he loves  has naught save
       nbsp  weary woe and bane to bear
inside is sickness outside living lowe  his first is fancy and
       nbsp    his last despair

when his sister heard this she marvelled at his eloquence and loquent speech and his readiness at answering her in verse and said to him o my brother when didst thou fall into this thy case and what hath betided thee that i find thee speaking in song and shedding tears that throng allah upon thee o my brother and by the honest love which is between us tell me what aileth thee and discover to me thy secret nor conceal from me aught of that which hath befallen thee in our absence for my breast is straitened and my life is troubled because of thee he sighed and railed tears like rain after which he said i fear o my sister if i tell thee that thou wilt not aid me to win my wish but wilt leave me to die wretchedly in mine anguish she replied no by allah o my brother i will not abandon thee though it cost me my life so he told her all that had befallen him and that the cause of his distress and affliction was the passion he had conceived for the young lady whom he had seen when he opened the forbidden door and how he had not tasted meat nor drink for ten days past then he wept with sore weeping and recited these couplets

restore my heart as twas within my breast  let mine eyes
       nbsp     sleep again then fly fro me
deem ye the nights have had the might to change  loves vow
       nbsp     who changeth may he never be

his sister wept for his weeping and was moved to ruth for his case and pitied his strangerhood so she said to him o my brother be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for i will venture being and risk existence to content thee and devise thee a device wherewith though it cost me my dear life and all i hold dear thou mayst get possession of her and accomplish thy desire if such be the will of allah almighty but i charge thee o my brother keep the matter secret from my sisterhood and discover not thy case to any one of them lest my life be lost with thy life an they question thee of opening the forbidden door reply to them i opened it not no never but i was troubled at heart for your absence and by my loneliness here and yearning for youfn65 and he answered yes this is the right rede so he kissed her head and his heart was comforted and his bosom broadened he had been nigh upon death for excess of affright for he had gone in fear of her by reason of his having opened the door but now his life and soul returned to him then he sought of her somewhat of food and after serving it she left him and went in to her sisters weeping and mourning for him they questioned her of her case and she told them how she was heavy at heart for her brother because he was sick and for ten days no food had found way into his stomach so they asked the cause of his sickness and she answered the reason was our severance from him and our leaving him desolate for these days we have been absent from him were longer to him than a thousand years and scant blame to him seeing he is a stranger and solitary and we left him alone with none to company with him or hearten his heart more by token that he is but a youth and may be he called to mind his family and his mother who is a woman in years and bethought him that she weepeth for him all whiles of the day and watches of the night ever mourning his loss and we used to solace him with our society and divert him from thinking of her when her sisters heard these words they wept in the stress of their distress for him and said walláhi—fore allah he is not to blame then they went out to the army and dismissed it after which they went into hasan and saluted him with the salam when they saw his charms changed with yellow colour and shrunken body they wept for very pity and sat by his side and comforted him and cheered him with converse relating to him all they had seen by the way of wonders and rarities and what had befallen the bridegroom with the bride they abode with him thus a whole month tendering him and caressing him with words sweeter than syrup but every day sickness was added to his sickness which when they saw they bewept him with sore weeping and the youngest wept even more than the rest at the end of this time the princesses having made up their minds to ride forth ahunting and abirding invited their sister to accompany them but she said by allah o my sisters i cannot go forth with you whilst my brother is in this plight nor indeed till he be restored to health and there cease from him that which is with him of affliction rather will i sit with him and comfort him they thanked her for her kindness and said to her allah will requite thee all thou dost with this stranger then they left her with him in the palace and rode forth taking with them twenty days victual—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and eightyninth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that the princesses mounted and rode forth ahunting and abirding after leaving in the palace their youngest sister sitting by hasans side and as soon as the damsel knew that they had covered a long distance from home she went in to him and said o my brother come show me the place where thou sawest the maidens he rejoiced in her words making sure of winning his wish and replied bismillah on my head then he essayed to rise and show her the place but could not walk so she took him up in her arms holding him to her bosom between her breasts and opening the staircasedoor carried him to the top of the palace and he showed her the pavilion where he had seen the girls and the basin of water wherein they had bathed then she said to him set forth to me o my brother their case and how they came so he described to her whatso he had seen of them and especially the girl of whom he was enamoured but hearing these words she knew her and her cheeks paled and her case changed quoth he o my sister what aileth thee to wax wan and be troubled and quoth she o my brother know thou that this young lady is the daughter of a sovran of the jann of one of the most puissant of their kings and her father had dominion over men and jinn and wizards and cohens and tribal chiefs and guards and countries and cities and islands galore and hath immense wealth in store our father is a viceroy and one of his vassals and none can avail against him for the multitude of his many and the extent of his empire and the muchness of his monies he hath assigned to his offspring the daughters thou sawest a tract of country a whole years journey in length and breadth a region girt about with a great river and a deep and thereto none may attain nor man nor jann he hath an army of women smiters with swords and lungers with lances fiveandtwenty thousand in number each of whom whenas she mounteth steed and donneth battlegear eveneth a thousand knights of the bravest moreover he hath seven daughters who in valour and prowess equal and even excel their sistersfn66 and he hath made the eldest of them the damsel whom thou sawestfn67 queen over the country aforesaid and who is the wisest of her sisters and in valour and horsemanship and craft and skill and magic excels all the folk of her dominions the girls who companied with her are the ladies of her court and guards and grandees of her empire and the plumed skins wherewith they fly are the handiwork of enchanters of the jann now an thou wouldst get possession of this queen and wed this jewel seldseen and enjoy her beauty and loveliness and grace do thou pay heed to my words and keep them in thy memory they resort to this place on the first day of every month and thou must take seat here and watch for them and when thou seest them coming hide thee near the pavilion sitting where thou mayst see them without being seen of them and beware again beware lest thou show thyself or we shall all lose our lives when they doff their dress note which is the feathersuit of her whom thou lovest and take it and it only for this it is that carrieth her to her country and when thou hast mastered it thou hast mastered her and beware lest she wile thee saying o thou who hast robbed my raiment restore it to me because here am i in thine hands and at thy mercy for an thou give it her she will kill thee and break down over us palace and pavilion and slay our sire know then thy case and how thou shalt act when her companions see that her feathersuit is stolen they will take flight and leave her to thee and beware lest thou show thyself to them but wait till they have flown away and she despaireth of them whereupon do thou go in to her and hale her by the hair of her headfn68 and drag her to thee which being done she will be at thy mercy and i rede thee discover not to her that thou hast taken the feathersuit but keep it with care for so long as thou hast it in hold she is thy prisoner and in thy power seeing that she cannot fly to her country save with it and lastly carry her down to thy chamber where she will be thine when hasan heard her words his heart became at ease his trouble ceased and affliction left him so he rose to his feet and kissing his sisters head went down from the terrace with her into the palace where they slept that night he medicined himself till morning morrowed and when the sun rose he sprang up and opened the staircasedoor and ascending to the flat roof sat there till suppertide when his sister brought him up somewhat of meat and drink and a change of clothes and he slept and thus they continued doing day by day until the end of the month when he saw the new moon he rejoiced and began to watch for the birds and while he was thus behold up they came like lightning as soon as he espied them he hid himself where he could watch them unwatched by them and they lighted down one and all of them and putting off their clothes descended into the basin all this took place near the stead where hasan lay concealed and as soon as he caught sight of the girl he loved he arose and crept under cover little by little towards the dresses and allah veiled him so that none marked his approach for they were laughing and playing with one another till he laid hand on the dress now when they had made an end of their diversion they came forth of the basin and each of them slipped on her feathersuit but the damsel he loved sought for her plumage that she might put it on but found it not whereupon she shrieked and beat her cheeks and rent her raiment her sisterhoodfn69 came to her and asked what ailed her and she told them that her feathersuit was missing wherefore they wept and shrieked and buffeted their faces and they were confounded wotting not the cause of this and knew not what to do presently the night overtook them and they feared to abide with her lest that which had befallen her should befal them also so they farewelled her and flying away left her alone upon the terraceroof of the palace by the pavilion basin—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan had carried off the girls plumery she sought it but found it not and her sisterhood flew away leaving her alone when they were out of sight hasan gave ear to her and heard her say o who hast taken my dress and stripped me i beseech thee to restore it to me and cover my shame so may allah never make thee taste of my tribulation but when hasan heard her speak thus with speech sweeter than syrup his love for her redoubled passion got the mastery of his reason and he had not patience to endure from her so springing up from his hidingplace he rushed upon her and laying hold of her by the hair dragged her to him and carried her down to the basement of the palace and set her in his own chamber where he threw over her a silken cloakfn70 and left her weeping and biting her hands then he shut the door upon her and going to his sister informed her how he had made prize of his lover and carried her to his sleepingcloset and there quoth he she is now sitting weeping and biting her hands when his sister heard this she rose forthright and betook herself to the chamber where she found the captive weeping and mourning so she kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam and the young lady said to her o kings daughter do folk like you do such foul deed with the daughters of kings thou knowest that my father is a mighty sovran and that all the liege lords of the jinn stand in awe of him and fear his majesty for that there are with him magicians and sages and cohens and satans and marids such as none may cope withal and under his hand are folk whose number none knoweth save allah how then doth it become you o daughters of kings to harbour mortal men with you and disclose to them our case and yours else how should this man a stranger come at us hasans sister made reply o kings daughter in very sooth this human is perfect in nobleness and purposeth thee no villainy but he loveth thee and women were not made save for men did he not love thee he had not fallen sick for thy sake and wellnigh given up the ghost for desire of thee and she told her the whole tale how hasan had seen her bathing in the basin with her attendants and fallen in love with her and none had pleased him but she for the rest were all her handmaids and none had availed to put forth a hand to her when the princess heard this she despaired of deliverance and presently hasans sister went forth and brought her a costly dress wherein she robed her then she set before her somewhat of meat and drink and ate with her and heartened her heart and soothed her sorrows and she ceased not to speak her fair with soft and pleasant words saying have pity on him who saw thee once and became as one slain by thy love and continued to console her and caress her quoting fair says and pleasant instances but she wept till daybreak when her trouble subsided and she left shedding tears knowing that she had fallen into the net and that there was no deliverance for her then said she to hasans sister o kings daughter with this my strangerhood and severance from my country and sisterhood which allah wrote upon my brow patience becometh me to support what my lord hath foreordained therewith the youngest princess assigned her a chamber in the palace than which there was none goodlier and ceased not to sit with her and console her and solace her heart till she was satisfied with her lot and her bosom was broadened and she laughed and there ceased from her what trouble and oppression possessed her by reason of her separation from her people and country and sisterhood and parents thereupon hasans sister repaired to him and said arise go in to her in her chamber and kiss her hands and feetfn71 so he went in to her and did this and bussed her between the eyes saying o princess of fair ones and life of sprites and beholders delight be easy of heart for i took thee only that i might be thy bondsman till the day of doom and this my sister will be thy servant for i o my lady desire naught but to take thee to wife after the law of allah and the practice of his apostle and whenas thou wilt i will journey with thee to my country and carry thee to baghdadcity and abide with thee there moreover i will buy thee handmaidens and negro chattels and i have a mother of the best of women who will do thee service there is no goodlier land than our land everything therein is better than elsewhere and its folk are a pleasant people and bright of face now as he bespake her thus and strave to comfort her what while she answered him not a syllable lo there came a knocking at the palacegate so hasan went out to see who was at the door and found there the six princesses who had returned from hunting and birding whereat he rejoiced and went to meet them and welcomed them they wished him safety and health and he wished them the like after which they dismounted and going each to her chamber doffed their soiled clothes and donned fine linen then they came forth and demanded the game for they had taken a store of gazelles and wild cows hares and lions hyaenas and others so their suite brought out some thereof for butchering keeping the rest by them in the palace and hasan girt himself and fell to slaughtering for them in due formfn72 whilst they sported and made merry joying with great joy to see him standing amongst them hale and hearty once more when they had made an end of slaughtering they sat down and addressed themselves to get ready somewhat for breaking their fast and hasan coming up to the eldest princess kissed her head and on like wise did he with the rest one after other whereupon said they to him indeed thou humblest thyself to us passing measure o our brother and we marvel at the excess of the affection thou showest us but allah forfend that thou shouldst do this thing which it behoveth us rather to do with thee seeing thou art a man and therefor worthier than we who are of the jinnfn73 thereupon his eyes brimmed with tears and he wept sore so they said to him what causeth thee to weep indeed thou troublest our pleasant lives with thy weeping this day twould seem thou longest after thy mother and native land an things be so we will equip thee and carry thee to thy home and thy friends he replied by allah i desire not to part from you then they asked which of us hath vexed thee that thou art thus troubled but he was ashamed to say naught troubleth me save love of a damsel lest they should deny and disavow him so he was silent and would tell them nothing of his case then his sister came forward and said to them he hath caught a bird from the air and would have you help him to tame her whereupon they all turned to him and cried we are at thy service every one of us and whatsoever thou seekest that will we do but tell us thy tale and conceal from us naught of thy case so he said to his sister do thou tell them for i am ashamed before them nor can i face them with these words—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasan said to his sister do thou tell them my tale for before them i stand abashed nor can i face them with these words so she said to them o my sisters when we went away and left alone this unhappy one the palace was straitened upon him and he feared lest some one should come in to him for ye know that the sons of adam are light of wits so he opened the door of the staircase leading to the roof of his loneliness and trouble and sat there looking upon the wady and watching the gate in his fear lest any should come thither one day as he sat thus suddenly he saw ten birds approach him making for the palace and they lighted down on the brink of the basin which is in the pavilionterrace he watched these birds and saw amongst them one goodlier than the rest which pecked the others and flouted them whilst none of them dared put out a claw to it presently they set their nails to their neckcollars and rending their feathersuits came forth therefrom and became damsels each and every like the moon on fullest night then they doffed their dress and plunging into the water fell to playing with one another whilst the chief damsel ducked the others who dared not lay a finger on her and she was fairest of favour and most famous of form and most feateous of finery they ceased not to be in this case till near the hour of midafternoon prayer when they came forth of the basin and donning their feathershifts flew away home thereupon he waxed distracted with a heart afire for love of the chief damsel and repenting him that he had not stolen her plumery wherefore he fell sick and abode on the palaceroof expecting her return and abstaining from meat and drink and sleep and he ceased not to be so till the new moon showed when behold they again made their appearance according to custom and doffing their dresses went down into the basin so he stole the chief damsels feathersuit knowing that she could not fly save therewith hiding himself carefully lest they sight him and slay him then he waited till the rest had flown away when he arose and seizing the damsel carried her down from the terrace into the castle her sisters asked where is she and she answered she is with him in such a chamber quoth they describe her to us o our sister so quoth she she is fairer than the moon on the night of fullness and her face is sheenier than the sun the dew of her lips is sweeter than honey and her shape is straighter and slenderer than the cane one with eyes black as night and brow flowerwhite a bosom jewelbright breasts like pomegranates twain and cheeks like apples twain a waist with dimples overlain a navel like a casket of ivory full of musk in grain and legs like columns of alabastrine vein she ravisheth all hearts with naturekohld eyne and a waist slenderfine and hips of heaviest design and speech that heals all pain and pine she is goodly of shape and sweet of smile as she were the moon in fullest sheen and shine when the princesses heard these praises they turned to hasan and said to him show her to us so he arose with them all lovedistraught and carrying them to the chamber wherein was the captive damsel opened the door and entered preceding the seven princesses now when they saw her and noted her loveliness they kissed the ground between her hands marvelling at the fairness of her favour and the significance which showed her inner gifts and said to her by allah o daughter of the sovran supreme this is indeed a mighty matter and haddest thou heard tell of this mortal among women thou haddest marvelled at him all thy days indeed he loveth thee with passionate love yet o kings daughter he seeketh not lewdness but desireth thee only in the way of lawful wedlock had we known that maids can do without men we had impeached him from his intent albeit he sent thee no messenger but came to thee in person and he telleth us he hath burnt the feather dress else had we taken it from him then one of them agreed with the princess and becoming her deputy in the matter of the wedding contract performed the marriage ceremony between them whilst hasan clapped palms with her laying his hand in hers and she wedded him to the damsel by consent after which they celebrated her bridal feast as beseemeth kings daughters and brought hasan in to her so he rose and rent the veil and oped the gate and pierced the forgefn74 and brake the seal whereupon affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love and longing for her then since he had gotten that which he sought he gave himself joy and improvised these couplets

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan went in unto the kings daughter and did away her maidenhead he enjoyed her with exceeding joy and affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in lovelonging for her so he recited the lines aforesaid now the princesses were standing at the door and when they heard his verses they said to her o kings daughter hearest thou the words of this mortal how canst thou blame us seeing that he maketh poetry for love of thee and indeed he hath so done a thousand timesfn77 when she heard this she rejoiced and was glad and felt happy and hasan abode with her fortyfn78 days in all solace and delight joyance and happiest plight whilst the damsels renewed festivities for him every day and overwhelmed him with bounty and presents and rarities and the kings daughter became reconciled to her sojourn amongst them and forgot her kith and kin at the end of the forty days hasan saw in a dream one night his mother mourning for him and indeed her bones were wasted and her body had waxed shrunken and her complexion had yellowed and her favour had changed the while he was in excellent case when she saw him in this state she said to him o my son o hasan how is it that thou livest thy worldly life at thine ease and forgettest me look at my plight since thy loss i do not forget thee nor will my tongue cease to name thy name till i die and i have made thee a tomb in my house that i may never forget thee would heaven i knewfn79 if i shall live o my son to see thee by my side and if we shall ever again foregather as we were thereupon hasan awoke from sleep weeping and wailing the tears railed down his cheeks like rain and he became mournful and melancholy his tears dried not nor did sleep visit him but he had no rest and no patience was left to him when he arose the princesses came in to him and gave him goodmorrow and made merry with him as was their wont but he paid no heed to them so they asked his wife concerning his case and she said i ken not quoth they question him of his condition so she went up to him and said what aileth thee o my lord whereupon he moaned and groaned and told her what he had seen in his dream and repeated these two couplets

indeed afflicted sore are we and all distraught  seeking for
       nbsp    union yet we find no way
and loves calamities upon us grow  and love though light with
       nbsp    heaviest weight doth weigh

his wife repeated to the princesses what he said and they hearing the verses had pity on him and said to him in allahs name do as thou wilt for we may not hinder thee from visiting thy mother nay we will help thee to thy wish by what means we may but it behoveth that thou desert us not but visit us though it be only once a year and he answered to hear is to obey be your behest on my head and eyes then they arose forthright and making him ready victual for the voyage equipped the bride for him with raiment and ornaments and everything of price such as defy description and they bestowed on him gifts and presents which pens of ready writers lack power to set forth then they beat the magical kettledrum and up came the dromedaries from all sides they chose of them such as could carry all the gear they had prepared amongst the rest fiveandtwenty chests of gold and fifty of silver and mounting hasan and his bride on others rode with them three days wherein they accomplished a march of three months then they bade them farewell and addressed themselves to return whereupon his sister the youngest damsel threw herself on hasans neck and wept till she fainted when she came to herself she repeated these two couplets

neer dawn the severanceday on any wise  that robs of sleep
       nbsp     these heavylidded eyes
from us and thee it hath fair union torn  it wastes our force
       nbsp    and makes our forms its prize

her verses finished she farewelled him straitly charging him whenas he should have come to his native land and have foregathered with his mother and set his heart at ease to fail not of visiting her once in every six months and saying if aught grieve thee or thou fear aught of vexation beat the magians kettledrum whereupon the dromedaries shall come to thee and do thou mount and return to us and persist not in staying away he swore thus to do and conjured them to go home so they returned to the palace mourning for their separation from him especially the youngest with whom no rest would stay nor would patience her call obey but she wept night and day thus it was with them but as regards hasan and his wife they fared on by day and night over plain and desert site and valley and stony heights through noontide glare and dawns soft light and allah decreed them safety so that they reached bassorahcity without hindrance and made their camels kneel at the door of his house hasan then dismissed the dromedaries and going up to the door to open it heard his mother weeping and in a faint strain from a heart worn with partingpain and on fire with consuming bane reciting these couplets

how shall he taste of sleep who lacks repose  who wakes anight
       nbsp   when all in slumber wone

when hasan heard his mother weeping and wailing he wept also and knocked at the door a loud knock quoth she who is at the door and quoth he open whereupon she opened the door and knowing him at first sight fell down in a fainting fit but he ceased not to tend her till she came to herself when he embraced her and she embraced him and kissed him whilst his wife looked on mother and son then he carried his goods and gear into the house whilst his mother for that her heart was comforted and allah had reunited her with her son versified with these couplets

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasan with his mother then sat talking and she asked him how faredst thou o my son with the persian whereto he answered o my mother he was no persian but a magian who worshipped the fire not the allpowerful sire then he told her how he dealt with him in that he had journeyed with him to the mountain of clouds and sewed him up in the camels skin and how the vultures had taken him up and set him down on the summit and what he had seen there of dead folk whom the magian had deluded and left to die on the crest after they had done his desire and he told her how he had cast himself from the mountaintop into the sea and allah the most high had preserved him and brought him to the palace of the seven princesses and how the youngest of them had taken him to brother and he had sojourned with them till the almighty brought the magian to the place where he was and he slew him moreover he told her of his passion for the kings daughter and how he had made prize of her and of his seeing herfn81 in sleep and all else that had befallen him up to the time when allah vouchsafed them reunion she wondered at his story and praised the lord who had restored him to her in health and safety then she arose and examined the baggage and loads and questioned him of them so he told her what was in them whereat she joyed with exceeding joy then she went up to the kings daughter to talk with her and bear her company but when her eyes fell on her her wits were confounded at her brilliancy and she rejoiced and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace and she sat down beside her cheering her and comforting her heart while she never ceased to repeat alhamdolillah o my son for thy return to me safe and sound next morning early she went down into the market and bought mighty fine furniture and ten suits of the richest raiment in the city and clad the young wife and adorned her with everything seemiy then said she to hasan o my son we cannot tarry in this town with all this wealth for thou knowest that we are poor folk and the people will suspect us of practising alchemy so come let us depart to baghdad the housefn82 of peace where we may dwell in the caliphs sanctuary and thou shalt sit in a shop to buy and sell in the fear of allah to whom belong might and majesty and he shall open to thee the door of blessings with this wealth hasan approved her counsel and going forth straightway sold the house and summoned the dromedaries which he loaded with all his goods and gear together with his mother and wife then he went down to the tigris where he hired him a craft to carry them to baghdad and embarked therein all his possessions and his mother and wife they sailed up the river with a fair wind for ten days till they drew in sight of baghdad at which they all rejoiced and the ship landed them in the city where without stay or delay hasan hired a storehouse in one of the caravanserais and transported his goods thither he lodged that night in the khan and on the morrow he changed his clothes and going down into the city enquired for a broker the folk directed him to one and when the broker saw him he asked him what he lacked quoth he i want a house a handsome one and a spacious so the broker showed him the houses at his disposal and he chose one that belonged to one of the wazirs and buying it of him for an hundred thousand golden dinars gave him the price then he returned to his caravanserai and removed all his goods and monies to the house after which he went down to the market and bought all the mansion needed of vessels and carpets and other household stuff besides servants and eunuchs including a little black boy for the house he abode with his wife in all solace and delight of life three years during which time he was vouchsafed by her two sons one of whom he named násir and the other mansúr but at the end of this time he bethought him of his sisters the princesses and called to mind all their goodness to him and how they had helped him to his desire so he longed after them and going out to the marketstreets of the city bought trinkets and costly stuffs and fruitconfections such as they had never seen or known his mother asked him the reason of his buying these rarities and he answered i purpose to visit my sisters who showed me every kind of kindness and all the wealth that i at present enjoy is due to their goodness and munificence wherefore i will journey to them and return soon inshallah quoth she o my son be not long absent from me and quoth he know o my mother how thou shalt do with my wife here is her featherdress in a chest buried under ground in such a place do thou watch over it lest haply she hap on it and take it for she would fly away she and her children and i should never hear of them again and should die of grieving for them wherefore take heed o my mother while i warn thee that thou name this not to her thou must know that she is the daughter of a king of the jinn than whom there is not a greater among the sovrans of the jann nor a richer in troops and treasure and she is mistress of her people and dearest to her father of all he hath moreover she is passing highspirited so do thou serve her thyself and suffer her not to go forth the door neither look out of window nor over the wall for i fear the air for her when it blowethfn83 and if aught befel her of the calamities of this world i should slay myself for her sake she replied o my son i take refuge with allahfn84 from gainsaying thee am i mad that thou shouldst lay this charge on me and i disobey thee therein depart o my son with heart at ease and please allah soon thou shalt return in safety and see her and she shall tell thee how i have dealt with her but tarry not o my son beyond the time of travel—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan had determined to visit the princesses he gave his mother the orders we have mentionedfn85 now as fate would have it his wife heard what he said to his mother and neither of them knew it then hasan went without the city and beat the kettledrum whereupon up came the dromedaries and he loaded twenty of them with rarities of alirak after which he returned to his mother and repeated his charge to her and took leave of her and his wife and children one of whom was a yearling babe and the other two years old then he mounted and fared on without stopping night or day over hills and valleys and plains and wastes for a term of ten days till on the eleventh he reached the palace and went in to his sisters with the gifts he had brought them the princesses rejoiced at his sight and gave him joy of his safety whilst his sister decorated the palace within and without then they took the presents and lodging him in a chamber as before asked him of his mother and his wife and he told them that she had borne him two sons and the youngest princess seeing him well and in good case joyed with exceeding joy and repeated this couplet

i ever ask for news of you from whatso breezes pass  and never any but yourselves can pass across my mind

then he abode with them in all honour and hospitality for three months spending his time in feasting and merrymaking joy and delight hunting and sporting so fared it with him but as regards his wife she abode with his mother two days after her husbands departure and on the third day she said to her glory be to god have i lived with him three years and shall i never go to the bath then she wept and hasans mother had pity on her condition and said to her o my daughter here we are strangers and thy husband is abroad were he at home he would serve thee himself but as for me i know no one however o my daughter i will heat thee water and wash thy head in the hammambath which is in the house answered the kings daughter o my lady hadst thou spoken thus to one of the slavegirls she had demanded to be sold in the sultans open market and had not abode with theefn86 men are excusable because they are jealous and their reason telleth them that if a woman go forth the house haply she will do frowardness but women o my lady are not all equal and alike and thou knowest that if woman have a mind to aught whether it be the hammam or what not else none hath power over her to guard her or keep her chaste or debar her from her desire for she will do whatso she willeth and naught restraineth her but her reason and her religionfn87 then she wept and cursed fate and bemoaned herself and her strangerhood till hasans mother was moved to ruth for her case and knew that all she said was but truth and that there was nothing for it but to let her have her way so she committed the affair to allah extolled and exalted be he and making ready all that they needed for the bath took her and went with her to the hammam she carried her two little sons with her and when they entered they put off their clothes and all the women fell to gazing on the princess and glorifying god to whom belong might and majesty for that he had created so fair a form the women of the city even those who were passing by flocked to gaze upon her and the report of her was noised abroad in baghdad till the bath was crowded that there was no passing through it now it chanced there was present on that day and on that rare occasion with the rest of the women in the hammam one of the slavegirls of the commander of the faithful harun alrashid by name tohfahfn88 the lutanist and she finding the hammam over crowded and no passing for the throng of women and girls asked what was to do and they told her of the young lady so she walked up to her and considering her closely was amazed at her grace and loveliness and glorified god magnified be his majesty for the fair forms he hath created the sight hindered her from her bath so that she went not farther in nor washed but sat staring at the princess till she had made an end of bathing and coming forth of the caldarium donned her raiment whereupon beauty was added to her beauty she sat down on the divanfn89 whilst the women gazed upon her then she looked at them and veiling herself went out tohfah went out with her and followed her till she saw where she dwelt when she left her and returned to the caliphs palace and ceased not wending till she went in to the lady zubaydah and kissed ground between her hands whereupon quoth her mistress o tohfah why hast thou tarried in the hammam she replied o my lady i have seen a marvel never saw i its like amongst men or women and this it was that distracted me and dazed my wit and amazed me so that i forgot even to wash my head asked zubaydah and what was that  and tohfah answered o my lady i saw a damsel in the bath having with her two little boys like moons eye never espied her like nor before her nor after her neither is there the fellow of her form in the whole world nor her peer amongst ajams or turks or arabs by the munificence o my lady an thou toldest the commander of the faithful of her he would slay her husband and take her from him for her like is not to be found among women i asked of her mate and they told me that he is a merchant hasan of bassorah hight moreover i followed her from the bath to her own house and found it to be that of the wazir with the two gates one opening on the river and the other on the landfn90 indeed o my lady i fear lest the prince of true believers hear of her and break the law and slay her husband and take loveliesse with her—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetyfifth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when tohfah after seeing the kings daughter described her beauty to the lady zubaydah ending with indeed o my mistress i fear lest the prince of true believers hear of her and break the law and slay her mate and take her to wife zubaydah cried woe to thee o tohfah say me doth this damsel display such passing beauty and loveliness that the commander of the faithful should on her account barter his souls good for his worldly lust and break the holy law by allah needs must i look on her and if she be not as thou sayest i will bid strike off thy head o strumpet there are in the caliphs serraglio three hundred and three score slave girls after the number of the days of the year yet is there none amongst them so excellent as thou describest tohfah replied no by allah o my lady nor is there her like in all baghdad no nor amongst the arabs or the daylamites nor hath allah to whom belong might and majesty created the like of her thereupon zuhaydah called for masrur the eunuch who came and kissed the ground before her and she said to him o masrur go to the wazirs house that with the two gates one giving on the water and the other on the land and bring me the damsel who dwelleth there also her two children and the old woman who is with her and haste thou and tarry not said masrur i hear and i obey and repairing to hasans house knocked at the door quoth the old woman who is at the door and quoth he masrur the eunuch of the commander of the faithful so she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need and he replied the lady zubaydah daughter of alkasimfn91 and queenspouse of the commander of the faithful harun alrashid sixthfn92 of the sons of alabbas paternal uncle of the prophet whom allah bless and keep summoneth thee to her thee and thy sons wife and her children for the women have told her anent her and her beauty rejoined the old woman o my lord masrur we are foreigner folk and the girls husband my son who is abroad and far from home hath strictly charged me not to go forth nor let her go forth in his absence neither show her to any of the creatures of allah almighty and i fear me if aught befal her and he come back he will slay himself wherefore of thy favour i beseech thee o masrur require us not of that whereof we are unable masrur retorted o my lady if i knew aught to be feared for you in this i would not require you to go the lady zubaydah desireth but to see her and then she may return so disobey not or thou wilt repent and like as i take you i will bring you both back in safety inshallah hasans mother could not gainsay him so she went in and making the damsel ready brought her and her children forth and they all followed masrur to the palace of the caliphate where he carried them in and seated them on the floor before the lady zubaydah they kissed ground before her and called down blessings upon her and zubaydah said to the young lady who was veiled wilt thou not uncover thy face that i may look on it so she kissed the ground between her hands and discovered a face which put to shame the full moon in the height of heaven zubaydah fixed her eyes on her and let their glances wander over her whilst the palace was illumined by the light of her countenance whereupon the queen and the whole company were amazed at her beauty and all who looked on her became jinnmad and unable to bespeak one another as for zubaydah she rose and making the damsel stand up strained her to her bosom and seated her by herself on the couch moreover she bade decorate the palace in her honour and calling for a suit of the richest raiment and a necklace of the rarest ornaments put them upon her then said she to her o liege lady of fair ones verily thou astoundest me and fillest mine eyesfn93 what arts knowest thou she replied o my lady i have a dress of feathers and could i but put it on before thee thou wouldst see one of the fairest of fashions and marvel thereat and all who saw it would talk of its goodliness generation after generation zubaydah asked and where is this dress of thine and the damsel answered tis with my husbands mother do thou seek it for me of her so zubaydah said to the old woman o my lady the pilgrimess o my mother go forth and fetch us her featherdress that we may solace ourselves by looking on what she will do and after take it back again replied the old woman o my lady this damsel is a liar hast thou ever seen any of womankind with a dress of feathers indeed this belongeth only to birds but the damsel said to the lady zubaydah as thou livest o my lady she hath a featherdress of mine and it is in a chest which is buried in such a storecloset in the house so zubaydah took off her neck a rivière of jewels worth all the treasures of chosroe and cæsar and gave it to the old woman saying o my mother i conjure thee by my life take this necklace and go and fetch us this dress that we may divert ourselves with the sight thereof and after take it again but she sware to her that she had never seen any such dress and wist not what the damsel meant by her speech then the lady zubaydah cried out at her and taking the key from her called masrur and said to him as soon as her came take this key and go to the house then open it and enter a storecloset there whose door is such and such and amiddlemost of it thou wilt find a chest buried take it out and break it open and bring me the featherdress which is therein and set it before me—and shahrazad

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the lady zubaydah having taken the key from hasans mother handed it to masrur saying take this key and open such a closet then bring forth of it the chest break it open bring me the featherdress which is therein and set it before me hearkening and obedience replied he and taking the key went forth whereupon the old woman arose and followed him weepingeyed and repenting her of having given ear to the damsel and gone with her to the bath for her desire to go thither was but a device so she went with him to the house and opened the door of the closet and he entered and brought out the chest then he took therefrom the featherdress and wrapping it in a napkin carried it to the lady zubaydah who took it and turned it about marvelling at the beauty of its make after which she gave it to the damsel saying is this thy dress of feathers she replied yes o my lady and at once putting forth her hand took it joyfully then she examined it and rejoiced to find it whole as it was not a feather gone so she rose and came down from beside the lady zubaydah and taking her sons in her bosom wrapped herself in the featherdress and became a bird by the ordinance of allah to whom belong might and majesty whereat zubaydah marvelled as did all who were present then she walked with a swaying and graceful gait and danced and sported and flapped her wings whilst all eyes were fixed on her and all marvelled at what she did then said she with fluent tongue is this goodly o my ladies and they replied yes o princess of the fair all thou dost is goodly said she and this o my mistresses that i am about to do is better yet then she spread her wings and flying up with her children to the dome of the palace perched on the saloonroof whilst they all looked at her wideeyed and said by allah this is indeed a rare and peregrine fashion never saw we its like then as she was about to take flight for her own land she bethought her of hasan and said hark ye my mistresses and she improvised these coupletsfn94

o who bast quitted these abodes and faredst lief and light  to
       nbsp    other objects of thy love with fain and fastest flight
deemst thou that bided i with you in solace and in joy  or
       nbsp    that my days amid you all were clear of bane and blight
when i was captive taen of love and snarèd in his snare  he
       nbsp    made of love my prison and he fared fro me forthright
so when my fear was hidden he made sure that neer should i 
       nbsp     pray to the one th omnipotent to render me my right
he charged his mother keep the secret with all the care she
       nbsp     could  in closet shut and treated me with enemys
       nbsp     despight
but i oerheard their words and held them fast in memory  and
       nbsp   hoped for fortune fair and weal and blessings infinite
my faring to the hammambath then proved to me the means  of
       nbsp   making minds of folk to be confounded at my sight
wondered the bride of alrashid to see my brilliancy  when she
       nbsp   beheld me right and left with all of beauty dight
then quoth i o our caliphs wife i once was wont to own  a
       nbsp   dress of feathers rich and rare that did the eyes delight
an it were now on me thou shouldst indeed see wondrous things 
       nbsp  that would efface all sorrows and disperse all sores of
       nbsp   sprite
then deigned our caliphs bride to cry where is that dress of
       nbsp    thine  and i replied in house of him kept darkling as
       nbsp   the night
so down upon it pounced masrúr and brought it unto her  and
       nbsp   when twas there each feather cast a ray of beaming light
therewith i took it from his hand and opened it straightway  and
       nbsp    saw its plumèd bosom and its buttons pleased my sight
and so i clad myself therein and took with me my babes  and
       nbsp     spread my wings and flew away with all my main and might
saying o husbands mother mine tell him when cometh he  an
       nbsp     ever wouldest meet her thou from house and home must flee

when she had made an end of her verses the lady zubaydah said to her wilt thou not come down to us that we may take our fill of thy beauty o fairest of the fair glory be to him who hath given thee eloquence and brilliance but she said far be from me that the past return should see then said she to the mother of the hapless wretched hasan by allah o my lady o mother of my husband it irketh me to part from thee but whenas thy son cometh to thee and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the islands of wákfn95 to me then she took flight with her children and sought her own country whilst the old woman wept and beat her face and moaned and groaned till she swooned away when she came to herself she said to the lady zubaydah o my lady what is this thou hast done and zubaydah said to her o my lady the pilgrimess i knew not that this would happen and hadst thou told me of the case and acquainted me with her condition i had not gainsaid thee nor did i know until now that she was of the flying jinn else had i not suffered her to don the dress nor permitted her to take her children but now o my lady words profit nothing so do thou acquit me of offence against thee and the old woman could do no otherwise than shortly answer thou art acquitted then she went forth the palace of the caliphate and returned to her own house where she buffeted her face till she swooned away when she came to herself she pined for her daughterinlaw and her grandchildren and for the sight of her son and versified with these couplets

your faring on the partingday drew many a tear fro me  who
       nbsp     must your flying from the home long mourn in misery
and cried i for the parting pang in anguish likest fire  and
       nbsp     tearfloods chafed mine eyelids sore that neer of tears
       nbsp     were free
yes this is severance ah shall we eer oy return of you 
       nbsp     for your departure hath deprived my power of privacy
ah would they had returned to me in covenant of faith  an they
       nbsp     return perhaps restore of past these eyne may see

then arising she dug in the house three graves and betook herself to them with weeping all whiles of the day and watches of the night and when her sons absence was longsome upon her and grief and yearning and unquiet waxed upon her she recited these couplets

deep in mine eyeballs ever dwells the phantomform of thee  my
       nbsp     heart when throbbing or at rest holds fast thy memory
and love of thee doth never cease to course within my breast 
       nbsp     as course the juices in the fruits which deck the branchy
       nbsp     tree
and every day i see thee not my bosom straightened is  and even
       nbsp     censurers excuse the woes in me they see
o thou whose love hath gotten hold the foremost in the heart  of
       nbsp     me whose fondness is excelled by mine insanity
fear the compassionate in my case and some compassion show 
       nbsp     love of thee makes me taste of death in bitterest pungency
—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetyseventh night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasans mother bewept through the watches of the night and the whiles of the day her separation from her son and his wife and children on this wise it fared with her but as regards hasan when he came to the princesses they conjured him to tarry with them three months after which long sojourn they gave him five loads of gold and the like of silver and one load of victual and accompanied him on his homeward way till he conjured them to return whereupon they farewelled him with an embrace but the youngest came up to him to bid him adieu and clasping his neck wept till she fainted then she recited these two couplets

when shall the severancefire be quenched by union love with
       nbsp     you  when shall i win my wish of you and days that were
       nbsp     renew
the partingday affrighted me and wrought me dire dismay  and
       nbsp     doubleth woe o master mine by the sad word adieu

anon came forward the second princess and embraced him and recited these two couplets

farewelling thee indeed is like to bidding life farewell  and
       nbsp     like the loss of zephyrfn96 tis to lose thee far our
       nbsp    sight
thine absence is a flaming fire which burneth up my heart  and
       nbsp   in thy presence i enjoy the gardens of delightfn97

presently came forward the third and embraced him and recited these two couplets

we left not taking leave of thee when bound to other goal 
       nbsp   from aught of ill intention or from weariness and dole
thou art my soul my very soul the only soul of me  and how
       nbsp    shall i farewell myself and say adieu my soulfn98

after her came forward the fourth and embraced him and recited these two couplets

nought garred me weep save where and when of severance spake he
       nbsp     persisting in his cruel will with sore persistency
look at this pearllike ornament ive hung upon mine ear  tis
       nbsp     of the tears of me compact this choicest jewelry

in her turn came forward the fifth and embraced him and recited these two couplets

ah fare thee not for ive no force thy faring to endure  nor
       nbsp     een to say the word farewell before my friend is sped
nor any patience to support the days of severance  nor any
       nbsp   tears on ruined house and wasted home to shed

next came the sixth and embraced him and recited these two couplets

i cried as the camels went off with them  and love pained my
       nbsp    vitals with sorest pain
had i a king who would lend me rule  id seize every ship that
       nbsp    dares sail the main

lastly came forward the seventh and embraced him and recited these couplets

when thou seest parting be patient still  nor let foreign
       nbsp     parts deal thy soul affright
but abide expecting a swift return  for all hearts hold
       nbsp     parting in sore despight

and eke these two couplets

indeed im heartbroken to see thee start  nor can i farewell
       nbsp     thee ere thou depart
allah wotteth i left not to say adieu  save for fear that saying
       nbsp     would melt your heart

hasan also wept for parting from them till he swooned and repeated these couplets

indeed ran my tears on the severanceday  like pearls i
       nbsp     threaded in necklaceway
the cameleer drove his camels with song  but i lost heart
       nbsp    patience and strength and stay
i bade them farewell and retired in grief  from trystplace and
       nbsp     camp where my dearlings lay
i turned me unknowing the way nor joyed  my soul but in hopes
       nbsp     to return some day
oh listen my friend to the words of love  god forbid thy heart
       nbsp     forget all i say
o my soul when thou partest wi them part too  with all joys of
       nbsp     life nor for living pray

then he farewelled them and fared on diligently night and day till he came to baghdad the house of peace and sanctuary of the abbaside caliphs unknowing what had passed during his wayfare at once entering his house he went in to his mother to salute her but found her worn of body and wasted of bones for excess of mourning and watching weeping and wailing till she was grown thin as a toothpick and could not answer him a word so he dismissed the dromedaries then asked her of his wife and children and she wept till she fainted and he seeing her in this state searched the house for them but found no trace of them then he went to the storecloset and finding it open and the chest broken and the featherdress missing knew forthright that his wife had possessed herself thereof and flown away with her children then he returned to his mother and finding her recovered from her fit questioned her of his spouse and babes whereupon she wept and said o my son may allah amply requite thee their loss these are their three tombsfn99 when hasan heard these words of his mother he shrieked a loud shriek and fell down in a faintingfit in which he lay from the first of the day till noontide whereupon anguish was added to his mothers anguish and she despaired of his life however after awhile he came to himself and wept and buffeted his face and rent his raiment and went about the house clean distraught reciting these two coupletsfn100

folk have made moan of passion before me of past years  and
live and dead for absence have suffered pains and fears
but that within my bosom i harbour with mine eyes  ive never
seen the like of nor heard with mine ears
then finishing his verses he bared his brand and coming up to his mother said to her except thou tell me the truth of the case i will strike off thy head and kill myself she replied o my son do not such deed put up thy sword and sit down till i tell thee what hath passed so he sheathed his scymitar and sat by her side whilst she recounted to him all that had happened in his absence from first to last adding o my son but that i saw her weep in her longing for the bath and feared that she would go and complain to thee on thy return and thou wouldst be wroth with me i had never carried her thither and were it not that the lady zubaydah was wroth with me and took the key from me by force i had never brought out the featherdress though i died for it but thou knowest o my son that no hand may measure length with that of the caliphate when they brought her the dress she took it and turned it over fancying that somewhat might be lost thereof but she found it uninjured wherefore she rejoiced and making her children fast to her waist donned the feathervest after the lady zubaydah had pulled off to her all that was upon herself and clad her therein in honour of her and because of her beauty no sooner had she donned the dress than she shook and becoming a bird promenaded about the palace whilst all who were present gazed at her and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness then she flew up to the palace roof and perching thereon looked at me and said whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of separation upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him leave his native land and journey to the islands of wak and seek me this then is her story and what befel in thine absence—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetyeighth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that as soon as hasans mother had made an end of her story he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which continued till the end of day when he revived and fell to buffeting his face and writhing on the floor like a scotched snake his mother sat weeping by his head until midnight when he came to himself and wept sore and recited these coupletsfn101

pause ye and see his sorry state since when ye fain withdrew 
       nbsp    haply when wrought your cruelty youll have the grace to
       nbsp    rue
for an ye look on him youll doubt of him by sicknessstress 
       nbsp    as though by allah he were one before ye never knew
he dies for nothing save for love of you and he would be 
       nbsp    numbered amid the dead did not he moan and groan for you
and deem not pangs of severance sit all lightly on his soul 
       nbsp    tis heavy load on loverwight twere lighter an ye slew

then having ended his verse he rose and went round about the house weeping and wailing groaning and bemoaning himself five days during which he tasted nor meat nor drink his mother came to him and conjured him till he broke his fast and besought him to leave weeping but he hearkened not to her and continued to shed tears and lament whilst she strove to comfort him and he heeded her not then he recited these coupletsfn102

beareth for love a burden sore this soul of me  could break a
       nbsp     mortals back however strong that be
i am distraught to see my case and languor grows  making my day
       nbsp   and night indifferent in degree
i own to having dreaded death before this day  this day i hold
       nbsp   my death mine only remedy

and hasan ceased not to do thus till daybreak when his eyes closed and he saw in a dream his wife grieffull and repentant for that which she had done so he started up from sleep crying out and reciting these two couplets

their image bides with me neer quits me neer shall fly 
       nbsp    but holds within my heart most honourable stead
but for reunionhope id see me die forthright  and but for
       nbsp     phantomform of thee my sleep had fled

and as morning morrowed he redoubled his lamentations he abode weepingeyed and heavyhearted wakeful by night and eating little for a whole month at the end of which he bethought him to repair to his sisters and take counsel with them in the matter of his wife so haply they might help him to regain her accordingly he summoned the dromedaries and loading fifty of them with rarities of alirak committed the house to his mothers care and deposited all his goods in safe keeping except some few he left at home then he mounted one of the beasts and set out on his journey single handed intent upon obtaining aidance from the princesses and he stayed not till he reached the palace of the mountain of clouds when he went in to the damsels and gave them the presents in which they rejoiced then they wished him joy of his safety and said to him o our brother what can ail thee to come again so soon seeing thou wast with us but two months since whereupon he wept and improvised these couplets

my soul for loss of lover sped i sight  nor life enjoying
       nbsp    neither lifes delight
my case is one whose cure is all unknown  can any cure the sick
       nbsp    but doctor wight
o who hast reft my sleepjoys leaving me  to ask the breeze
       nbsp    that blew from that fair site—
blew from my lovers land the land that owns  those charms so
       nbsp    sore a grief in soul excite
o breeze that visitest her land perhaps  breathing her scent
       nbsp   thou mayst revive my sprite

and when he ended his verse he gave a great cry and fell down in a faintingfit the princesses sat round him weeping over him till he recovered and repeated these two couplets

haply and happily may fortune bend her rein  bringing my love
       nbsp    for times a freke of jealous strainfn103
fortune may prosper me supply mine every want  and bring a
       nbsp    blessing where before were ban and bane

then he wept till he fainted again and presently coming to himself recited the two following couplets

my wish mine illness mine unease by allah own  art thou
       nbsp   content then i in love contented wone
dost thou forsake me thus sans crime or sin  meet me in ruth i
       nbsp    pray and be our parting gone

then he wept till he swooned away once more and when he revived he repeated these couplets

sleep fled me by my side wake ever shows  and hoard of
       nbsp     teardrops from these eyne aye flows
for love they weep with beads cornelianlike  and growth of
       nbsp     distance greater dolence grows
lit up my longing o my love in me  flames burning neath my
       nbsp     ribs with fiery throes
remembering thee a tear i never shed  but in it thunder roars
       nbsp     and leven glows

then he wept till he fainted away a fourth time and presently recovering recited these couplets

ah for lowe of love and longing suffer ye as suffer we  say
       nbsp    as pine we and as yearn we for you are pining ye
allah do the death of love what a bitter draught is his  would
       nbsp    i wot of love what plans and what projects nurseth he
your faces radiantfair though afar from me they shine  are
       nbsp   mirrored in our eyes whatsoever the distance be
my heart must ever dwell on the memories of your tribe  and the
       nbsp   turtledove reneweth all as oft as moaneth she
ho thou dove who passest nighttide in calling on thy fere 
       nbsp    thou doublest my repine bringing grief for company
and leavest thou mine eyelids with weeping unfulfilled  for the
       nbsp     dearlings who departed whom we never more may see
i melt for the thought of you at every time and hour  and i
       nbsp     long for you when night showeth cheek of blackest blee

now when his sister heard these words and saw his condition and how he lay fainting on the floor she screamed and beat her face and the other princesses hearing her scream came out and learning his misfortune and the transport of love and longing and the passion and distraction that possessed him they questioned him of his case he wept and told them what had befallen in his absence and how his wife had taken flight with her children wherefore they grieved for him and asked him what she said at leavetaking answered he o my sisters she said to my mother tell thy son whenas he cometh to thee and the nights of sever ance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the winds of love and longing shake him dolefully let him fare in the islands of wak to me when they heard his words they signed one to other with their eyes and shook their heads and each looked at her sister whilst hasan looked at them all then they bowed their heads groundwards and bethought themselves awhile after which they raised their heads and said there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great presently adding put forth thy hand to heaven and when thou reach thither then shalt thou win to thy wife—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seven hundred and ninetyninth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the princesses said to hasan put forth thy hand to heaven and when thou reach thither then shalt thou win to wife and children thereat the tears ran down his cheeks like rain and wet his clothes and he recited these couplets

pink cheeks and eyes enpupild black have dealt me sore
       nbsp  despight  and whenas wake overpowered sleep my patience
       nbsp   fled in fright
the fair and sleeklimbed maidens hard of heart withal laid waste
       nbsp   my very bones till not a breath is left for man to sight
houris who fare with gait of grace as roes oer sandymound 
       nbsp    did allahs saints behold their charms theyd doat thereon
       nbsp    forthright
faring as fares the garden breeze that bloweth in the dawn  for
       nbsp   love of them a sore unrest and troubles rack my sprite
i hung my hopes upon a maid a loveling fair of them  for whom
       nbsp    my heart still burns with lowe in lazáhell they light—
a       nbsp dearling soft of sides and haught and graceful in her gait 
her grace is white as morning but her hair is black as
       nbsp    night
she stirreth me but ah how many heroes have her cheeks 
       nbsp    upstirred for love and eke her eyes that mingle black and
       nbsp    white

then he wept whilst the princesses wept for his weeping and they were moved to compassion and jealousy for him so they fell to comforting him and exhorting him to patience and offering up prayers for his reunion with his wife whilst his sister said to him o my brother be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and be patient so shalt thou win thy will for whoso hath patience and waiteth that he seeketh attaineth patience holdeth the keys of relief and indeed the poet saith

let destiny with slackened rein its course appointed fare and
       nbsp    lie thou down to sleep by night with heart devoid of care
for twixt the closing of an eye and th opening thereof god
       nbsp     hath it in his power to change a case from foul to
       nbsp   fairfn104

so hearten thy heart and brace up thy resolve for the son of ten years dieth not in the ninthfn105 weeping and grief and mourning gender sickness and disease wherefore do thou abide with us till thou be rested and i will devise some device for thy winning to thy wife and children inshallah—so it please allah the most high and he wept sore and recited these verses

an i be healed of disease in frame  im unhealed of illness in
       nbsp     heart and sprite
there is no healing disease of love  save lover and loved one
       nbsp     to reunite

then he sat down beside her and she proceeded to talk with him and comfort him and question him of the cause and the manner of his wifes departure so he told her and she said by allah o my brother i was minded to bid thee burn the featherdress but satan made me forget it she ceased not to converse with him and caress him and company with him other ten days whilst sleep visited him not and he delighted not in food and when the case was longsome upon him and unrest waxed in him he versified with these couplets

a beloved familiar oerreigns my heart  and allahs ruling
       nbsp     reigns evermore
she hath all the arabs united charms  this gazelle who feeds on
       nbsp    my bosoms core
though my skill and patience for love of her fail  i weep
       nbsp    whilst i wot that tis vain to deplore
the dearling hath twice seven years as though  she were moon of
       nbsp     five nights and of five plus fourfn106

when the youngest princess saw him thus distracted for love and longing for passion and the feverheat of desire she went in to her sisterhood weepingeyed and woefulhearted and shedding copious tears threw herself upon them kissed their feet and besought them to devise some device for bringing hasan to the islands of wak and effecting his reunion with his wife and wees she ceased not to conjure them to further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep before them till she made them weep and they said to her hearten thy heart we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his family inshallah and he abode with them a whole year during which his eyes never could retain their tears now the sisterhood had an uncle brothergerman to their sire and his name was abd alkaddús or slave of the most holy and he loved the eldest with exceeding love and was wont to visit her once a year and do all she desired they had told him of hasans adventure with the magian and how he had been able to slay him whereat he rejoiced and gave the eldest princess a pouchfn107 which contained certain perfumes saying o daughter of my brother an thou be in concern for aught or if aught irk thee or thou stand in any need cast of these perfumes upon fire naming my name and i will be with thee forthright and will do thy desire this speech was spoken on the first of moharramfn108 and the eldest princess said to one of the sisterhood lo the year is wholly past and my uncle is not come rise bring me the firesticks and the box of perfumes so the damsel arose rejoicing and fetching what she sought laid it before her sister who opened the box and taking thence a little of the perfume cast it into the fire naming her undes name nor was it burnt out ere appeared a dustcloud at the farther end of the wady and presently lifting it discovered a shaykh riding on an elephant which moved at a swift and easy pace and trumpeted under the rider as soon as he came within sight of the princesses he began making signs to them with his hands and feet nor was it long ere he reached the castle and alighting from the elephant came in to them whereupon they embraced him and kissed his hands and saluted him with the salam then he sat down whilst the girls talked with him and questioned him of his absence quoth he i was sitting but now with my wife your aunt when i smelt the perfumes and hastened to you on this elephant what wouldst thou o daughter of my brother quoth she o uncle indeed we longed for thee as the year is past and tis not thy wont to be absent from us more than a twelvemonth answered he i was busy but i purposed to come to you tomorrow wherefore they thanked him and blessed him and sat talking with him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundredth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the girls sat down to chat with their uncle the eldest said to him o my uncle we told thee the tale of hasan of bassorah whom bahram the magian brought and how he slew the wizard and how after enduring all manner of hardships and horrors he made prize of the supreme kings daughter and took her to wife and journeyed with her to his native land replied he yes and what befel him after that quoth the princess she played him false after he was blest with two sons by her for she took them in his absence and fled with them to her own country saying to his mother whenas thy son returneth to thee and asketh for me and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the islands of wak to me when abd alkaddus heard this he shook his head and bit his forefinger then bowing his brow groundwards he began to make marks on the earth with his fingertipsfn109 after which he again shook his head and looked right and left and shook his head a third time whilst hasan watched him from a place where he was hidden from him then said the princesses to their uncle return us some answer for our hearts are rent in sunder but he shook his head at them saying o my daughters verily hath this man wearied himself in vain and cast himself into grievous predicament and sore peril for he may not gain access to the islands of wak with this the princesses called hasan who came forth and advancing to shaykh abd alkaddus kissed his hand and saluted him the old man rejoiced in him and seated him by his side whereupon quoth the damsels o uncle acquaint our brother hasan with that thou hast told us so he said to hasan o my son put away from thee this peine forte et dure for thou canst never gain access to the islands of wak though the flying jinn and the wandering stars were with thee for that betwixt thee and these islands are seven wadys and seven seas and seven mighty mountains how then canst thou come at this stead and who shall bring thee thither wherefore allah upon thee o my son do thou reckon thy spouse and sons as dead and turn back forthright and weary not thy sprite indeed i give thee good counsel an thou wilt but accept it hearing these words from the shaykh hasan wept till he fainted and the princesses sat round him weeping for his weeping whilst the youngest sister rent her raiment and buffeted her face till she swooned away when shaykh abd alkaddus saw them in this transport of grief and trouble and mourning he was moved to ruth for them and cried be ye silent then said he to hasan o my son hearten thy heart and rejoice in the winning of thy wish an it be the will of allah the most high presently adding rise o my son take courage and follow me so hasan arose forthright and after he had taken leave of the princesses followed him rejoicing in the fulfilment of his wish then the shaykh called the elephant and mounting took hasan up behind him and fared on three days with their nights like the blinding leven till he came to a vast blue mountain whose stones were all of azure hue and amiddlemost of which was a cavern with a door of chinese iron here he took hasans hand and let him down and alighting dismissed the elephant then he went up to the door and knocked whereupon it opened and there came out to him a black slave hairless as he were an ifrit with brand in right hand and targe of steel in left when he saw abd alkaddus he threw sword and buckler from his grip and coming up to the shaykh kissed his hand thereupon the old man took hasan by the hand and entered with him whilst the slave shut the door behind them when hasan found himself in a vast cavern and a spacious through which ran an arched corridor and they ceased not faring on therein a mile or so till it abutted upon a great open space and thence they made for an angle of the mountain wherein were two huge doors cast of solid brass the old man opened one of them and said to hasan sit at the door whilst i go within and come back to thee in haste and beware lest thou open it and enter then he fared inside and shutting the door after him was absent during a full sidereal hour after which he returned leading a black stallion thin of flank and short of nose which was ready bridled and saddled with velvet housings and when it ran it flew and when it flew the very dust in vain would pursue and brought it to hasan saying mount so he mounted and abd alkaddus opened the second door beyond which appeared a vast desert then the twain passed through the door into that desert and the old man said to him o my son take this scroll and wend thou whither this steed will carry thee when thou seest him stop at the door of a cavern like this alight and throw the reins over the saddlebow and let him go he will enter the cavern which do thou not enter with him but tarry at the door five days without being weary of waiting on the sixth day there will come forth to thee a black shaykh clad all in sable with a long white beard flowing down to his navel as soon as thou seest him kiss his hands and seize his skirt and lay it on thy head and weep before him till he take pity on thee and he will ask thee what thou wouldst have when he saith to thee what is thy want give him this scroll which he will take without speaking and go in and leave thee wait at the door other five days without wearying and on the sixth day expect him and if he come out to thee himself know that thy wish will be won but if one of his pages come forth to thee know that he who cometh forth to thee purposeth to kill thee and—the peacefn110 for know o my son that whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and first night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that after handing the scroll to hasan shaykh abd alkaddus told him what would befal him and said whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death but also who ventureth naught advantageth naught however an thou fear for thy life cast it not into danger of destruction but an thou fear not up and do thy will for i have expounded to thee the whole case yet shouldest thou be minded to return to thy friends the elephant is still here and he will carry thee to my nieces who will restore thee to thy country and return thee to thy home and allah will vouchsafe thee a better than this girl of whom thou art enamoured hasan answered the shaykh saying and how shall life be sweet to me except i win my wish by allah i will never turn back till i regain my beloved or my death overtake me and he wept and recited these couplets

for loss of lover mine and stress of love i dree  i stood
bewailing self in deep despondency
longing for him the springcamps dust i kissed and kissed 
but this bred more of grief and galling reverie
god guard the gone who in our hearts must eer abide  with
nearing woes and joys which still the farther flee
they say me patience but they bore it all away  on
partingday and left me naught save tormentry
and naught affrighted me except the word he said  forget me
not when gone nor drive from memory
to whom shall turn i hope in whom when you are lost  who were
my only hopes and joys and woes of me
but ah the pang of homereturn when parting thus  how joyed at
seeing me return mine enemy
then wellaway this twas i guarded me against  and ah thou
lowe of love double thine ardencyfn111
an fled for aye my friends ill not survive the flight  yet an
they deign return oh joy oh ecstacy
never by allah tears and weeping ill contain  for loss of you
but tears on tears and tears will rain
when abd alkaddus heard his verse he knew that he would not turn back from his desire nor would words have effect on him and was certified that naught would serve him but he must imperil himself though it lose him his life so he said to him know o my son that the islands of wak are seven islands wherein is a mighty host all virgin girls and the inner isles are peopled by satans and marids and warlocks and various tribesmen of the jinn and whoso entereth their land never returneth thence at least none hath done so to this day so allah upon thee return presently to thy people for know that she whom thou seekest is the kings daughter of all these islands and how canst thou attain to her hearken to me o my son and haply allah will vouchsafe thee in her stead a better than she o my lord answered hasan though for the love of her i were cut in pieces yet should i but redouble in love and transport there is no help but that i enter the wak islands and come to the sight of my wife and children and inshallah i will not return save with her and with them said the shaykh then nothing will serve thee but thou must make the journey hasan replied nothing and i only ask of thee thy prayers for help and aidance so haply allah will reunite me with my wife and children right soon then he wept for stress of longing and recited these couplets

you are my wish of creatures brightestlight  i deem you lief
       nbsp   as hearing fain as sight
you hold my heart which hath become your home  and since you
       nbsp   left me lords right sores my plight
then think not i have yielded up your love  your love which set
       nbsp    this wretch in fierce affright
you went and went my joy whenas you went  and waned and waxed
       nbsp   wan the brightest light
you left me lone to watch the stars in woe  railing tears
       nbsp    likest raindrops infinite

o night wind an thou pass the tribe where they abide  give
       nbsp    them my greeting life is fain of flight
and tell them somewhat of the pangs i bear  the loved one
       nbsp   kenneth not my case aright

then he wept with sore weeping till he fainted away and when he came to himself shaykh abd alkaddus said to him o my son thou hast a mother make her not taste the torment of thy loss hasan replied by allah o my lord i will never return except with my wife or my death shall overtake me and he wept and wailed and recited these couplets

by loves right naught of farness thy slave can estrange  nor
       nbsp     am i one to fail in my fealty
i suffer such pains did i tell my case  to folk theyd cry
       nbsp     madness clean witless is he
then ecstasy lovelonging transport and lowe  whose case is
       nbsp     such case how shall ever he be

with this the old man knew that he would not turn from his purpose though it cost him his life so he handed him the scroll and prayed for him and charged him how he should do saying i have in this letter given a strict charge concerning thee to abú alruwayshfn112 son of bilkís daughter of muin for he is my shaykh and my teacher and all men and jinn humble themselves to him and stand in awe of him and now go with the blessing of god hasan forthright set out giving the horse the rein and it flew off with him swiftlier than lightning and stayed not in its course ten days when he saw before him a vast loom black as night walling the world from east to west as he neared it the stallion neighed under him whereupon there flocked to it horses in number as the drops of rain none could tell their tale or against them prevail and fell to rubbing themselves against it hasan was affrighted at them and fared forwards surrounded by the horses without drawing rein till he came to the cavern which shaykh abd alkaddus had described to him the steed stood still at the door and hasan alighted and bridged the bridle over the saddlebowfn113 whereupon the steed entered the cavern whilst the rider abode without as the old man had charged him pondering the issue of his case in perplexity and distraction and unknowing what would befal him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and second night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasan dismounting from the steed stood at the cavernmouth pondering the issue of his case and unknowing what might befal him he abode standing on the same spot five days with their nights sleepless mournful tearfuleyed distracted perplexed pondering his severance from home and family comrades and friends with weeping eyelids and heavy heart then he bethought him of his mother and of what might yet happen to him and of his separation from his wife and children and of all that he had suffered and he recited these couplets

with you is my heartcure a heart that goes  and from
       nbsp     hillfoot of eyelids the tearrill flows
and parting and sorrow and exile and dole  and farness from
       nbsp     country and throe that oerthrows
naught am i save a lover distracted by love  far parted from
       nbsp     loved one and wilted by woes
and tis love that hath brought me such sorrow say where  is
       nbsp     the noble of soul who such sorrow unknows

hardly had hasan made an end of his verses when out came the shaykh abu alruwaysh a blackamoor and clad in black raiment and at first sight he knew him by the description that abd alkaddus had given him he threw himself at his feet and rubbed his cheeks on them and seizing his skirt laid it on his head and wept before him quoth the old man what wantest thou o my son whereupon he put out his hand to him with the letter and abu alruwaysh took it and reentered the cavern without making him any answer so hasan sat down at the cavemouth in his place other five days as he had been bidden whilst concern grew upon him and terror redoubled on him and restlessness gat hold of him and he fell to weeping and bemoaning himself for the anguish of estrangement and much watching and he recited these couplets

glory to him who guides the skies  the lover sore in sorrow
       nbsp     lies
who hath not tasted of loves food  knows not what mean its
       nbsp     miseries
did i attempt to stem my tears  rivers of blood would fount and
       nbsp    rise
how many an intimate is hard  of heart and pains in sorest
       nbsp    wise
an she with me her word would keep  of tears and sighs id fain
       nbsp     devise
but im forgone rejected quite  ruin on me hath cast her eyes
at my fell pangs fell wildlings weep  and not a bird for me but
       nbsp     cries

hasan ceased not to weep till dawn of the sixth day when shaykh abu alruwaysh came forth to him clad in white raiment and with his hand signedfn114 to him to enter so he went in rejoicing and assured of the winning of his wish and the old man took him by the hand and leading him into the cavern fared on with him half a days journey till they reached an arched doorway with a door of steel the shaykh opened the door and they two entered a vestibule vaulted with onyx stones and arabesqued with gold and they stayed not walking till they came to a great hall and a wide paved and walled with marble in its midst was a flowergarden containing all manner trees and flowers and fruits with birds warbling on the boughs and singing the praises of allah the almighty sovran and there were four daises each facing other and in each dais a jetting fountain at whose corners stood lions of red gold spouting gerbes from their mouths into the basin on each dais stood a chair whereon sat an elder with exceeding store of books before himfn115 and censers of gold containing fire and perfumes and before each elder were students who read the books to him now when the twain entered the elders rose to them and did them honour whereupon abu alruwaysh signed to them to dismiss their scholars and they did so then the four arose and seating themselves before that shaykh asked him of the case of hasan to whom he said tell the company thy tale and all that hath betided thee from the beginning of thine adventure to the end so hasan wept with sore weeping and related to them his story with bahram whereupon all the shaykhs cried out and said is this indeed he whom the magian caused to climb the mountain of clouds by means of the vultures sewn up in the camelhide and hasan said yes so they turned to the shaykh abu alruwaysh and said to him o our shaykh of a truth bahram contrived his mounting to the mountaintop but how came he down and what marvels saw he there and abu alruwaysh said o hasan tell them how thou camest down and acquaint them with what thou sawest of marvels so he told them all that had befallen him first and last how he had gotten the magian into his power and slain him how he had delivered the youth from him and sent him back to his own country and how he had captured the kings daughter of the jinn and married her yet had she played him false and taken the two boys she had borne him and flown away brief he related to them all the hardships and horrors he had undergone whereat they marvelled each and every and said to abu alruwaysh o elder of elders verily by allah this youth is to be pitied but belike thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and third night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan told his tale to the elders they said to shaykh abu alruwaysh this youth is to be pitied and haply thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees he replied o my brothers in very sooth this is a grave matter and a perilous and never saw i any loathe his life save this youth you know that the islands of wak are hard of access and that none may come to them but at risk of life and ye know also the strength of their people and their guards moreover i have sworn an oath not to tread their soil nor transgress against them in aught so how shall this man come at the daughter of the great king and who hath power to bring him to her or help him in this matter replied the other o shaykh of shaykhs verily this man is consumed with desire and he hath endangered himself to bring thee a scroll from thy brother abd alkaddus wherefore it behoveth thee to help him and hasan arose and kissed abu alruwayshs feet and raising the hem of his garment laid it on his head weeping and crying i beseech thee by allah to reunite me with my wife and children though it cost me my life and my soul the four elders all wept for his weeping and said to abu alruwaysh deal generously with this unhappy and show him kindness for the sake of thy brother abd alkaddus and profit by this occasion to earn reward from allah for helping him quoth he this wilful youth weeteth not what he undertaketh but inshallah we will help him after the measure of our means nor leave aught feasible undone when hasan heard the shaykhs word he rejoiced and kissed the hands of the five elders one after other imploring their aidance thereupon abd alruwaysh took inkcase and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter which he sealed and gave to hasan together with a pouch of perfumed leatherfn116 containing incense and firesticksfn117 and other needs and said to him take strictest care of this pouch and whenas thou fallest into any strait burn a little of the incense therein and name my name whereupon i will be with thee forthright and save thee from thy stress moreover he bade one of those present fetch him an ifrit of the flying jinn and he did so incontinently whereupon quoth abu alruwaysh to the firedrake what is thy name replied the ifrit thy thrall is hight dahnash bin faktash and the shaykh said draw near to me so dahnash drew near to him and he put his mouth to his ear and said somewhat to him whereat the ifrit shook his head and answered i accept o elder of elders then said abu alruwaysh to hasan arise o my son mount the shoulders of this ifrit dahnash the flyer but when he heaveth thee heavenwards and thou hearest the angels glorifying god awelkin with subhána iláh have a care lest thou do the like else wilt thou perish and he too hasan replied i will not say a word no never and the old man continued o hasan after faring with thee all this day tomorrow at peep of dawn he will set thee down in a land cleanly white like unto camphor whereupon do thou walk on ten days by thyself till thou come to the gate of a city then enter and enquire for the king of the city and when thou comest to his presence salute him with the salam and kiss his hand then give him this scroll and consider well whatso he shall counsel thee hasan replied hearing and obeying and rose up and mounted the ifrits shoulders whilst the elders rose and offered up prayers for him and commended him to the care of dahnash the firedrake and when he had perched on the flyers back the ifrit soared with him to the very confines of the sky till he heard the angels glorifying god in heaven and flew on with him a day and a night till at dawn of the next day he set him down in a land white as camphor and went his way leaving him there when hasan found himself in the land aforesaid with none by his side he fared on night and day for ten days till he came to the gate of the city in question and entering enquired for the king they directed him to him and told him that his name was king hassúnfn118 lord of the land of camphor and that he had troops and soldiers enough to fill the earth in its length and breadth so he sought audience of him and being admitted to his presence found him a mighty king and kissed ground between his hands quoth the king what is thy want whereupon hasan kissed the letter and gave it to him the king read it and shook his head awhile then said to one of his officers take this youth and lodge him in the house of hospitality so he took him and stablished him in the guesthouse where he tarried three days eating and drinking and seeing none but the eunuch who waited on him and who entertained him with discourse and cheered him with his company questioning him of his case and how he came to that city whereupon he told him his whole story and the perilous condition wherein he was on the fourth day that eunuch carried him before the king who said to him o hasan thou comest to me seeking to enter the islands of wak as the shaykh of shaykhs adviseth me o my son i would send thee thither this very day but that by the way are many perils and thirsty wolds full of terrors yet do thou have patience and naught save fair shall befal thee for needs must i devise to bring thee to thy desire inshallah know o my son that here is a mighty hostfn119 equipped with arms and steeds and warlike gear who long to enter the wak islands and lack power thereto but o my son for the sake of the shaykh abu alruwaysh son of bilkisfn120 the daughter of muin i may not send thee back to him unfulfilled of thine affair presently there will come to us ships from the islands of wak and the first that shall arrive i will send thee on board of her and give thee in charge to the sailors so they may take care of thee and carry thee to the islands if any question thee of thy case and condition answer him saying i am kinsman to king hassun lord of the land of camphor and when the ship shall make fast to the shore of the islands of wak and the master shall bid thee land do thou land now as soon as thou comest ashore thou wilt see a multitude of wooden settles all about the beach of which do thou choose thee one and crouch under it and stir not and when dark night sets in thou wilt see an army of women appear and flock about the goods landed from the ship and one of them will sit down on the settle under which thou hast hidden thyself whereupon do thou put forth thy hand to her and take hold of her and implore her protection and know thou o my son that an she accord thee protection thou wilt win thy wish and regain thy wife and children but if she refuse to protect thee make thy mourning for thyself and give up all hope of life and make sure of death for indeed thou art a dead man understand o my son that thou adventurest thy life and this is all i can do for thee and—the peace—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and fourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king hassun spake these words to hasan and charged him as we have related ending with this is all i can do for thee and know that except the lord of heaven had aided thee thou hadst not come hither the youth wept till he swooned away and when he recovered he recited these two couplets

a term decreed my lot i spy  and when its days shall end i
       nbsp     die
though lions fought with me in lair  if time be mine id beat
       nbsp     them i

then having ended his verse he kissed the ground before the sovran and said to him o mighty king how many days remain till the coming of the ships replied the other in a months time they will come and will tarry here selling their cargueson other two months after which they will return to their own country so hope not to set out save after three whole months then the king bade him return to the house of hospitality and bade supply him with all that he needed of meat and drink and raiment fit for kings hasan abode in the guesthouse a month at the end of which the vessels arrived and the king and the merchants went forth to them taking hasan with them amongst them he saw a ship with much people therein like the shingles for number none knew their tale save he who created them she was anchored in midharbour and had cocks which transported her lading to the shore so hasan abode till the crew had landed all the goods and sold and bought and to the time of departure there wanted but three days whereupon the king sent for him and equipped him with all he required and gave him great gifts after which he summoned the captain of the great ship and said to him take this youth with thee in the vessel so none may know of him save thou and carry him to the islands of wak and leave him there and bring him not back and the rais said to hear is to obey with love and gladness then quoth the king to hasan look thou tell none of those who are with thee in the ship thine errand nor discover to them aught of thy case else thou art a lost man and quoth he hearing and obedience with this he farewelled the king after he had wished him long life and victory over his enviers and his enemies wherefore the king thanked him and wished him safety and the winning of his wish then he committed him to the captain who laid him in a chest which he embarked in a dinghy and bore him aboard whilst the folk were busy in breaking bulk and no man doubted but the chest contained somewhat of merchandise after this the vessels set sail and fared on without ceasing ten days and on the eleventh day they made the land so the rais set hasan ashore and as he walked up the beach he saw wooden settlesfn121 without number none knew their count save allah even as the king had told him he went on till he came to one that had no fellow and hid under it till nightfall when there came up a mighty many of women as they were locusts overswarming the land and they marched afoot and armed capàpie in hauberks and straitknit coats of mail hending drawn swords in their hands who seeing the merchandise landed from the ships busied themselves therewith presently they sat down to rest themselves and one of them seated herself on the settle under which hasan had crouched whereupon he took hold of the hem of her garment and laid it on his head and throwing himself before her fell to kissing her hands and feet and weeping and crying thy protection thy goodwill quoth she ho thou arise and stand up ere any see thee and slay thee so he came forth and springing up kissed her hands and wept and said to her o my mistress i am under thy protection adding have ruth on one who is parted from his people and wife and children one who hath haste to rejoin them and one who adventureth life and soul for their sake take pity on me and be assured that therefor paradise will be thy reward or an thou wilt not receive me i beseech thee by allah the great the concealer to conceal my case the merchants stared to see him talking with her and she hearing his words and beholding his humility was moved to ruth for him her heart inclined to him and she knew that he had not ventured himself and come to that place save for a grave matter so she said to him o my son be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear hearten thy heart and take courage and return to thy hidingplace till the coming night and allah shall do as he will then she took leave of him and hasan crept under the wooden settle as before whilst the troops lighted flambeaux of wax mixed with aloeswood and naddperfume and crude ambergrisfn122 and passed the night in sport and delight till the morning at daybreak the boats returned to the shore and the merchants busied themselves with buying and selling and the transport of the goods and gear till nightfall whilst hasan lay hidden beneath the settle weepingeyed and woefulhearted knowing not what was decreed to him in the secret preordainment of allah as he was thus behold the merchantwoman with whom he had taken refuge came up to him and giving him a habergeon and a helmet a spear a sword and a gilded girdle bade him don them and seat himself on the settle after which she left him for fear of the troops so he arose and donned the mailcoat and helmet and clasped the girdle about his middle then he slung the sword over his shoulder till it hung under his armpit and taking the spear in his hand sat down on that settle whilst his tongue neglected not to name allah almighty and call on him for protection—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and fifth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan received the weapons which the merchantwoman had given to him saying sit thee upon the settle and let none wot thy case he armed himself and took his seat whilst his tongue neglected not to name allah almighty and to call upon him for protection and behold there appeared cressets and lanthorns and flambeaux and up came the army of women so he arose and mingling with them became as one of them a little before daybreak they set out and hasan with them and fared on till they came to their camp where they dispersed each to her tent and hasan followed one of them and lo it was hers for whose protection he had prayed when she entered she threw down her arms and doffed her hauberk and veil so hasan did the like and looking at his companion saw her to be a grizzled old woman blueeyed and bignosed a calamity of calamities the foulest of all created things with face pockmarked and eyebrows bald gaptoothed and chapfallen with hair hoary nose running and mouth slaveringfn123 even as saith the like of her the poet

in her cheekcorners nine calamities  wone and when shown
       nbsp   each one jehannam is
hideous the face and favour foulest foul  as cheek of hog yea
       nbsp     tis a cesspool phiz

and indeed she was like a pied snake or a scald shewolf now when the old woman looked at hasan she marvelled and said how came this one to these lands and in which of the ships was he and how arrived he hither in safety and she fell to questioning him of his case and admiring at his arrival whereupon he fell at her feet and rubbed his face on them and wept till he fainted and when he recovered himself he recited these couplets

when will time grant we meet when shall we be  again united
       nbsp     after severance stark
and i shall win my choicest wish and view  blame end and love
       nbsp    abide without remark
were nile to flow as freely as my tears  twould leave no
       nbsp    region but with watermark
twould overthrow hijaz and egyptland  twould deluge syria and
       nbsp    twould drown irák
this o my love is caused by thy disdain  be kind and promise
       nbsp    meeting fair and fain

then he took the crones skirt and laid it on his head and fell to weeping and craving her protection when she saw his ardency and transport and anguish and distress her heart softened to him and she promised him her safeguard saying have no fear whatsoever then she questioned him of his case and he told her the manner of his coming thither and all that had befallen him from beginning to end whereat she marvelled and said this that hath betide thee methinks never betided any save thyself and except thou hadst been vouchsafed the especial protection of allah thou hadst not been saved but now o my son take comfort and be of good courage thou hast nothing more to fear for indeed thou hast won thy wish and attained thy desire if it please the most high thereat hasan rejoiced with joy exceeding and she sent to summon the captains of the army to her presence and it was the last day of the month so they presented themselves and the old woman said to them go out and proclaim to all the troops that they come forth tomorrow at daybreak and let none tarry behind for whoso tarryeth shall be slain they replied we hear and we obey and going forth made proclamation to all the host anent a review next morning even as she bade them after which they returned and told her of this whereby hasan knew that she was the commanderinchief of the army and the viceregent in authority over them and her name was shawahí the fascinator entituled umm aldawáhi or mother of calamitiesfn124 she ceased not to bid and forbid and hasan doffed not off his arms from his body that day now when the morning broke all the troops fared forth from their places but the old woman came not out with them and as soon as they were sped and the stead was clear of them she said to hasan draw near unto me o my sonfn125 so he drew near unto her and stood between her hands quoth she why and wherefore hast thou adventured thyself so boldly as to enter this land and how came thy soul to consent to its own undoing tell me the truth and the whole truth and fear aught of ill come of it for thou hast my plighted word and i am moved to compassion for thy case and pity thee and have taken thee under my protection so if thou tell me the truth i will help thee to win thy wish though it involve the undoing of souls and the destruction of bodies and since thou hast come to seek me no hurt shall betide thee from me nor will i suffer any to have at thee with harm of all who be in the islands of wak so he told her his tale from first to last acquainting her with the matter of his wife and of the birds how he had captured her as his prize from amongst the ten and married her and abode with her till she had borne him two sons and how she had taken her children and flown away with them whenas she knew the way to the featherdress brief he concealed from her no whit of his case from the beginning to that day but when shawahi heard his relation she shook her head and said to him glory be to god who hath brought thee hither in safety and made thee hap upon me for hadst thou happened on any but myself thou hadst lost thy life without winning thy wish but the truth of thine intent and thy fond affection and the excess of thy lovelonging for thy wife and yearning for thy children these it was that have brought thee to the attainment of thine aim didst thou not love her and love her to distraction thou hadst not thus imperilled thyself and alhamdolillah—praised be allah—for thy safety wherefore it behoveth us to do thy desire and conduce to thy quest so thou mayst presently attain that thou seekest if it be the will of almighty allah but know o my son that thy wife is not here but in the seventh of the islands of wak and between us and it is seven months journey night and day from here we go to an island called the land of birds wherein for the loud crying of the birds and the flapping of their wings one cannot hear other speak—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and sixth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman said to hasan indeed thy wife is in the seventh islandfn126 the greatest amongst the islands of wak and betwixt us and it is a sevenmonths journey from here we fare for the land of birds whereon for the force of their flying and the flapping of their wings we cannot hear one other speak over that country we journey night and day eleven days after which we come forth of it to another called the land of ferals where for stress of roaring of lions and howling of wolves and laughing of hyaenas and the crying of other beasts of prey we shall hear naught and therein we travel twenty days journey then we issue therefrom and come to a third country called the land of the jánn where for stress of the crying of the jinn and the flaming of fires and the flight of sparks and smoke from their mouths and the noise of their groaning and their arrogance in blocking up the road before us our ears will be deafened and our eyes blinded so that we shall neither hear nor see nor dare any look behind him or he perisheth but there horseman boweth head on saddlebow and raiseth it not for three days after this we abut upon a mighty mountain and a running river contiguous with the isles of wak which are seven in number and the extent whereof is a whole years journey for a wellgirt horseman and thou must know o my son that these troops are all virgin girls and that the ruler over us is a woman of the archipelago of wak on the bank of the river aforesaid is another mountain called mount wak and it is thus named by reason of a tree which beareth fruits like heads of the sons of adamfn127 when the sun riseth on them the heads cry out all saying in their cries— wak wak glory be to the creating king alkhallák and when we hear their crying we know that the sun is risen in like manner at sundown the heads set up the same cry wak wak glory to alkhallak and so we know that the sun hath set no man may abide with us or reach to us or tread our earth and betwixt us and the abidingplace of the queen who ruleth over us is a months journey from this shore all the lieges whereof are under her hand as are also the tribes of the jinn marids and satans while of the warlocks none kenneth the number save he who created them wherefore an thou be afraid i will send with thee one who will convey thee to the coast and there bring one who will embark thee on board a ship that bear thee to thine own land but an thou be content to tarry with us i will not forbid thee and thou shalt be with me in mine eyefn128 till thou win thy wish inshallah quoth he o my lady i will never quit thee till i foregather with my wife or lose my life and quoth she this is a light matter be of good heart for soon shalt thou come to thy desire allah willing and there is no help but that i let the queen know of thee that she may help thee to attain thine aim hasan blessed her and kissed her head and hands thanking her for her good deed and exceeding kindness and firm will then he set out with her pondering the issue of his case and the horrors of his strangerhood wherefore he fell aweeping and awailing and recited these couplets

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman questioned hasan of the girls company after company if haply his wife were among them but as often as she asked him of a troop he made answer she is not among these o my lady last of all there came up a damsel attended by ten slavegirls and thirty waitingwomen all of them highbosomed maidens they put off their clothes and went down into the river where the damsel fell to riding the high horse over her women throwing them down and ducking them on this wise she continued for a full hour after which all came up out of the water and sat down and they brought her napkinsfn131 of goldpurfled silk with which she dried herself then they brought her clothes and jewels and ornaments of the handiwork of the jinn and she donned them and rose and walked with graceful pace among the troops she and her maidens when hasan saw her his heart was ready to fly from his breast and he said verily this girl is the likest of all folk to the bird i saw in the basin atop of the palace of my sisters the princesses and she lorded it over her lieges even as doth this one the old woman asked o hasan is this thy wife and he answered no by thy life o my lady this is not my wife nor ever in my life have i set eyes on her neither among all the girls i have seen in these islands is there the like of my wife nor her match for symmetry and grace and beauty and loveliness then said shawaki describe her to me and acquaint me with all her attributes that i may have her in my mind for i know every girl in the islands of wak being commander of the army of maids and governor over them wherefore an thou describe her to me i shall know her and will contrive for thee to take her quoth he my wife hath the fairest face and a form all grace smooth is she of cheeks and high of breasts with eyes of liquid light calves and thighs plump to sight teeth snowy white with dulcet speech dight in speech soft and bland as she were a willowwand her gifts are a moral and lips are red as coral her eyes wear natural kohldye and her lower labiafn132 in softness lie on her right cheek is a mole and on her waist under her navel is a sign her face shines as the rondure of the moon in sheen her waist is slight her hips a heavy weight and the water of her mouth the sick doth heal as it were kausar or salsabilfn133 said the old woman give me an increased account of her allah increase thee of passion for her quoth he my wife hath a face the fairest fair and oval cheeks the rarest rare neck long and spare and eyes that kohl wear her side face shows the anemones of nuuman her mouth is like a seal of cornelian and flashing teeth that lure and stand one in stead of cup and ewer she is cast in the mould of pleasantness and between her thighs is the throne of the caliphate there is no such sanctuary among the holy places as saith in its praise the poet

       nbsp  man of patience fain

thereupon the old woman bowed her head groundwards awhile then raising it said laud be to the lord the mighty of award indeed i am afflicted with thee o hasan would heaven i had never known thee this woman whom thou describest to me as thy wife i know by description and i know her to be none other than the eldest daughter of the supreme king she who ruleth over all the islands of wak so open both eyes and consider thy case and if thou be asleep awake for if this woman be indeed thy wife it is impossible for thee ever to obtain her and though thou come to her yet couldst thou not avail to her possession since between thee and her the distance is as that between earth and heaven wherefore o my son return presently and cast not thyself into destruction nor cast me with thee for meseemeth thou hast no lot in her so return whence thou camest lest our lives be lost and she feared for herself and for him when hasan heard her words he wept till he fainted and she left not sprinkling water on his face till he came to himself when he continued to weep so that he drenched his dress with tears for the much cark and care and chagrin which betided him by reason of her words and indeed he despaired of life and said to the old woman o my lady and how shall i go back after having come hither verily i thought not thou wouldst forsake me nor fail of the winning of my wish especially as thou art the commanderinchief of the army of the girls answered shawahl o my son i doubted not but thy wife was a maid of the maids and had i known she was the kings daughter i had not suffered thee to come hither nor had i shown the troops to thee for all the love i bear thee but now o my son thou hast seen all the girls naked so tell me which of them pleaseth thee and i will give her to thee in lieu of thy wife and do thou put it that thy wife and children are dead and take her and return to thine own country in safety ere thou fall into the kings hand and i have no means of delivering thee so allah upon thee o my son hearken unto me choose thyself one of these damsels in the stead of yonder woman and return presently to thy country in safety and cause me not quaff the cup of thine anguish for by allah thou hast cast thyself into affliction sore and peril galore wherefrom none may avail to deliver thee evermore but hasan hung down his head and wept with long weeping and recited these couplets

blame not said i to all who blamèd me  mine eyelids
       nbsp   naught but tears were made to dree
the tears that brim these orbs have overflowed  my checks for

leave me to love though waste this form of me  for i of love

you wronged me after swearing troth and plight  falsed my
       nbsp  companionship and turned to flee
and cup of humbling for your rigours sore  ye made me drain what
       nbsp     day departed ye
then melt o heart with longing for their sight  and o mine
       nbsp    eyes with crowns of tears be dight

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and eighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman said to hasan by allah o my son hearken to my words choose thee one of these girls in lieu of thy wife and presently return to thy country in safety he hung down his head and recited the couplets quoted above then he wept till he swooned away and shawahl sprinkled water on his face till he revived when she addressed him o my lord i have no shift left because if i carry thee to the city thy life is lost and mine also for when the queen cometh to know of this she will blame me for admitting thee into her lands and islands whereto none of adams sons hath access and will slay me for bringing thee with me and for suffering mortal to look upon the virgins seen by thee in the sea whom neer touched male neither approached mate and hasan sware that he had never looked on them with evil of eye she resumed o my son hearken to me and return to thy country and i will give thee wealth and treasures and things of price such as shall suffice thee for all the women in the world moreover i will give thee a girl of the best of them so lend an ear to my words and return presently and imperil not thyself indeed i counsel thee with good counsel but he wept and rubbed both cheeks against her feet saying o my lady and mistress and coolth of mine eyes how can i turn back now that i have made my way hither without the sight of those i desire and now that i have come near the beloveds site hoping for meeting forthright so haply there may be a portion in reunion to my plight and he improvised these couplets

o kings of beauty grace to prisoner taen  of eyelids fit to

censor of me leave blame and stint advice  thou bringest
       nbsp    wearying words and wisdom vain
why heat my passion with this flame and up  braid me when
       nbsp    naught thou knowest of its bane
captured me eyes with passion maladifs  and overthrew me with

i scatter tears the while i scatter verse  you are my theme for

hearing his verses the old woman was moved to ruth for him and allah planted the seed of affection for him in her heart so coming up to him she consoled him saying be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and put away trouble from thy thought for by allah i will venture my life with thee till thou attain thine aim or death undo me with this hasans heart was comforted and his bosom broadened and he sat talking with the old woman till the end of the day when all the girls dispersed some entering their townmansions and others nighting in the tents then the old woman carried him into the city and lodged him in a place apart lest any should come to know of him and tell the queen of him and she should slay him and slay her who had brought him thither moreover she served him herself and strave to put him in fear of the awful majesty of the supreme king his wifes father whilst he wept before her and said o my fady i choose death for myself and loathe this worldly life if i foregather not with my wife and children i have set my existence on the venture and will either attain my aim or die so the old woman fell to pondering the means of bringing him and his wife together and casting about how to do in the case of this unhappy one who had thrown himself into destruction and would not be diverted from his purpose by fear or aught else for indeed he reeked not of his life and the sayer of bywords saith lover in nowise hearkeneth he to the speech of the man who is fancyfree now the name of the queen of the island wherein they were was núr alhudàfn137 eldest daughter of the supreme king and she had six virgin sisters abiding with their father whose capital and court were in the chief city of that region and who had made her ruler over all the lands and islands of wak so when the ancient dame saw hasan on fire with yearning after his wife and children she rose up and repaired to the palace and going in to queen nur alhuda kissed ground before her for she had a claim on her favour because she had reared the kings daughters one and all and had authority over each and every of them and was high in honour and consideration with them and with the king nur alhuda rose to her as she entered and embracing her seated her by her side and asked her of her journey she answered by allah o my lady twas a blessed journey and i have brought thee a gift which i will presently present to thee adding o my daughter o queen of the age and the time i have a favour to crave of thee and i fain would discover it to thee that thou mayst help me to accomplish it and but for my confidence that thou wilt not gainsay me therein i would not expose it to thee asked the queen and what is thy need expound it to me and i will accomplish it to thee for i and my kingdom and troops are all at thy commandment and disposition therewithal the old woman quivered as quivereth the reed on a day when the stormwind is abroad and saying in herself ofn138 protector protect me from the queens mischieffn139 fell down before her and acquainted her with hasans case saying o my lady a man who had hidden himself under my wooden settle on the seashore sought my protection so i took him under my safeguard and carried him with me among the army of girls armed and accoutred so that none might know him and brought him into the city and indeed i have striven to affright him with thy fierceness giving him to know of thy power and prowess but as often as i threatened him he weepeth and reciteth verses and sayeth needs must i have my wife and children or die and i will not return to my country without them and indeed he hath adventured himself and come to the islands of wak and never in all my days saw i mortal heartier of heart than he or doughtier of derringdo save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and ninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman related to queen nur alhuda the adventure of hasan ending with never i saw any one heartier of heart than he save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery the queen after lending an attentive ear and comprehending the case waxed wroth at her with exceeding wrath and bowed her head awhile groundwards then raising it she looked at shawahi and said to her o illomened beldam art thou come to such a pass of lewdness that thou carriest males men with thee into the islands of wak and bringest them into me unfearing of my mischief who hath foregone thee with this fashion that thou shouldst do thus by the head of the king but for thy claim on me for fosterage and service i would forthwith do both him and thee to die the foulest of deaths that travellers might take warning by thee o accursed lest any other do the like of this outrageous deed thou hast done which none durst hitherto but go and bring him hither forthright that i may see him or i will strike off thy head o accursed so the old woman went out from her confounded unknowing whither she went and saying all this calamity hath allah driven upon me from this queen because of hasan and going in to him said rise speak with the queen o wight whose last hour is at hand so he rose and went with her whilst his tongue ceased not to call upon almighty allah and say o my god be gracious to me in thy decrees and deliver me from this thine afflictionfn140 and shawahi went with him charging him by the way how he should speak with the queen when he stood before nur alhuda he found that she had donned the chinveilfn141 so he kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam improvising these two couplets

god make thy glory last in joy of life  allah confirm the
       nbsp   boons he deigned bestow
thy grace and grandeur may our lord increase  and aye th
       nbsp    almighty aid thee oer thy foe

when he ended his verse nur alhuda bade the old woman ask him questions before her that she might hear his answers so she said to him the queen returneth thy salamgreeting and saith to thee what is thy name and that of thy country and what are the names of thy wife and children on whose account thou art come hither quoth he and indeed he had made firm his heart and destiny aided him o queen of the age and tide and peerless jewel of the epoch and the time my name is hasan the fullfilled of sorrow and my native city is bassorah i know not the name of my wifefn142 but my childrens names are násir and mansúr when the queen heard his reply and his provenance she bespoke him herself and said and whence took she her children he replied o queen she took them from the city of baghdad and the palace of the caliphate quoth nur alhuda and did she say naught to thee at the time she flew away and quoth he yes she said to my mother whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of severance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth meeting and reunion to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the islands of wak to me whereupon queen nur alhuda shook her head and said to him had she not desired thee she had not said to thy mother this say and had she not yearned for reunion with thee never had she bidden thee to her stead nor acquainted thee with her abidingplace rejoined hasan o mistress of kings and asylum of prince and pauper whatso happened i have told thee and have concealed naught thereof and i take refuge from evil with allah and with thee wherefore oppress me not but have compassion on me and earn recompense and requital for me in the world to come and aid me to regain my wife and children grant me my urgent need and cool mine eyes with my children and help me to the sight of them then he wept and wailed and lamenting his lot recited these two couplets

yea i will laud thee while the ringdove moans  though fail
       nbsp    my wish of due and lawful scope
neer was i whirled in bliss and joys gone by  wherein i found

the queen shook her head and bowed it in thought a long time then raising it she said to hasan and indeed she was wroth i have ruth on thee and am resolved to show thee in review all the girls in the city and in the provinces of my island and in case thou know thy wife i will deliver her to thee but an thou know her not and know not her place i will put thee to death and crucify thee over the old womans door replied hasan i accept this from thee o queen of the age and am content to submit to this thy condition there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and he recited these couplets

then queen nur alhuda commanded that not a girl should abide in the city but should come up to the palace and pass in review before hasan and moreover she bade shawahi go down in person and bring them up herself accordingly all the maidens in the city presented themselves before the queen who caused them to go in to hasan hundred after hundred till there was no girl left in the place but she had shown her to him yet he saw not his wife amongst them then said she to him seest thou her amongst these and he replied by thy life o queen she is not amongst them with this she was sore enraged against him and said to the old woman go in and bring out all who are in the palace and show them to him so she displayed to him every one of the palacegirls but he saw not his wife among them and said to the queen by the life of thy head o queen she is not among these whereat the queen was wroth and cried out at those around her saying take him and hale him along face to earth and cut off his head least any adventure himself after him and intrude upon us in our country and spy out our estate by thus treading the soil of our islands so they threw him down on his face and dragged him along then covering his eyes with his skirt stood at his head with bared brands awaiting royal permission thereupon shawahi came forward and kissing the ground before the queen took the hem of her garment and laid it on her head saying o queen by my claim for fosterage be not hasty with him more by token of thy knowledge that this poor wretch is a stranger who hath adventured himself and suffered what none ever suffered before him and allah to whom belong might and majesty preserved him from death for that his life was ordained to be long he heard of thine equity and entered thy city and guarded sitefn144 wherefore if thou put him to death the report will dispread abroad of thee by means of the travellers that thou hatest strangers and slayest them he is in any case at thy mercy and the slain of thy sword if his wife be not found in thy dominions and whensoever thou desireth his presence i can bring him back to thee moreover in very sooth i took him under my protection only of my trust in thy magnanimity through my claim on thee for fosterage so that i engaged to him that thou wouldst bring him to his desire for my knowledge of thy justice and quality of mercy but for this i had not brought him into thy kingdom for i said to myself the queen will take pleasure in looking upon him and hearing him speak his verses and his sweet discourse and eloquent which is like unto pearls strung on string moreover he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat wherefore he hath a claim upon us—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and tenth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when queen nur alhuda bade her pages seize hasan and smite his neck the old woman shawahi began to reason with her and say verily he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat wherefore he hath a claim upon us the more especially since i promised him to bring him in company with thee and thou knowest that parting is a grievous ill and severance hath power to kill especially separation from children now he hath seen all our women save only thyself so do thou show him thy face the queen smiled and said how can he be my husband and have had children by me that i should show him my face then she made them bring hasan before her and when he stood in the presence she unveiled her face which when he saw he cried out with a great cry and fell down fainting the old woman ceased not to tend him till he came to himself and as soon as he revived he recited these couplets

       nbsp     for this severancerack

when he ended his verse he rose and looking on the queens face cried out with a great cry for stress whereof the palace was like to fall upon all therein then he swooned away again and the old woman ceased not to tend him till he revived when she asked him what ailed him and he answered in very sooth this queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

       nbsp    grant us boon of safe return

then said hasan to the queen once more by allah thou art not my wife but thou art the likest of all folk to her hereupon nur alhuda laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her sidefn145 then she said to him o my friend take thy time and observe me attentively answer me at thy leisure what i shall ask thee and put away from thee insanity and perplexity and inadvertency for relief is at hand answered hasan o mistress of kings and asylum of all princes and paupers when i looked upon thee i was distracted seeing thee to be either my wife or the likest of all folk to her but now ask me whatso thou wilt quoth she what is it in thy wife that resembleth me and quoth he o my lady all that is in thee of beauty and loveliness elegance and amorous grace such as the symmetry of thy shape and the sweetness of thy speech and the blushing of thy cheeks and the jutting of thy breasts and so forth all resembleth her and thou art her very self in thy faculty of parlance and the fairness of thy favour and the brilliancy of thy browfn146 when the queen heard this she smiled and gloried in her beauty and loveliness and her cheeks reddened and her eyes wantoned then she turned to shawahi umm dawahi and said to her o my mother carry him back to the place where he tarried with thee and tend him thyself till i examine into his affair for an he be indeed a man of manliness and mindful of friendship and love and affection it behoveth we help him to win his wish more by token that he hath sojourned in our country and eaten of our victual not to speak of the hardships of travel he hath suffered and the travail and horrors he hath undergone but when thou hast brought him to thy house commend him to the care of thy dependents and return to me in all haste and allah almighty willingfn147 all shall be well thereupon shawahi carried him back to her lodging and charged her handmaids and servants and suite wait upon him and bring him all he needed nor fail in what was his due then she returned to queen nur alhuda who bade her don her arms and set out taking with her a thousand doughty horsemen so she obeyed and donned her wargear and having collected the thousand riders reported them ready to the queen who bade her march upon the city of the supreme king her father there to alight at the abode of her youngest sister manár alsanáfn148 and say to her clothe thy two sons in the coats of mail which their aunt hath made them and send them to her for she longeth for them moreover the queen charged her keep hasans affair secret and say to manar alsana after securing her children thy sister inviteth thee to visit her then she continued bring the children to me in haste and let her follow at her leisure do thou come by a road other than her road and journey night and day and beware of discovering this matter to any and i swear by all manner oaths that if my sister prove to be his wife and it appear that her children are his i will not hinder him from taking her and them and departing with them to his own country—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and sixteenth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nur alhuda was certified that the little ones were hasans children and that her sister manar alsana was his wife of whom he had come in quest she raged with exceeding rage too great to be assuaged and screamed in hasans face and reviled him and kicked him in the breast so that he fell on his back in a swoon then she cried out at him saying arise fly for thy life but that i swore that no evil should betide thee from me should thy tale prove true i would slay thee with mine own hand forthright and she cried out at the old woman who fell on her face for fear and said to her by allah but that i am loath to break the oath that i swore i would put both thee and him to death after the foulest fashion presently adding arise go out from before me in safety and return to thine own country for i swear by my fortune if ever mine eye espy thee or if any bring thee in to me after this i will smite off thy head and that of whoso bringeth thee then she cried out to her officers saying put him out from before me so they thrust him out and when he came to himself he recited these couplets

then he once more fell down in a swoon and when he came to himself he found himself without the palace whither they had dragged him on his face so he rose stumbling over his skirts and hardly crediting his escape from nur alhuda now this was grievous to shawahi but she dared not remonstrate with the queen by reason of the violence of her wrath and forthright hasan went forth distracted and knowing not whence to come or whither to go the world for all its wideness was straitened upon him and he found none to speak a kind word with him and comfort him nor any to whom he might resort for counsel or to apply for refuge wherefore he made sure of death for that he could not journey to his own country and knew none to travel with him neither wist he the way thither nor might he pass through the wady of the jann and the land of beasts and the islands of birds so giving himself up for lost he bewept himself till he fainted and when he revived he bethought him of his children and his wife and of that might befal her with her sister repenting him of having come to those countries and of having hearkened to none and recited these couplets

then he went on till he came without the city where he found the river and walked along its bank knowing not whither he went such was hasans case but as regards his wife manar alsana as she was about to carry out her purpose and to set out on the second day after the departure of the old woman with her children behold there came in to her one of the chamberlains of the king her sire and kissed ground between his hands—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when manar alsana was about to set out upon the journey behold a chamberlain of the king her sire came in to her and kissing the ground before her said o princess the supreme king thy father saluteth thee and biddeth thee to him so she rose and accompanied the chamberlain to learn what was required by her father who seated her by his side on the couch and said to her o my daughter know that i have this night had a dream which maketh me fear for thee and that long sorrow will betide thee from this thy journey quoth she how so o my father and what didst thou see in thy dream and quoth he i dreamt that i entered a hidden hoard wherein was great store of monies of jewels of jacinths and of other riches but twas as if naught pleased me of all this treasure and jewelry save seven bezels which were the finest things there i chose out one of the seven jewels for it was the smallest finest and most lustrous of them and its water pleased me so i took it in my handpalm and fared forth of the treasury when i came without the door i opened my hand rejoicing and turned over the jewel when behold there swooped down on me out of the welkin a strange bird from a far land for it was not of the birds of our country and snatching it from my hand returned with it whence it camefn155 whereupon sorrow and concern and sore vexation overcame me and my exceeding chagrin so troubled me that i awoke mourning and lamenting for the loss of the jewel at once on awaking i summoned the interpreters and expounders of dreams and declared to them my dreamfn156 and they said to me thou hast seven daughters the youngest of whom thou wilt lose and she will be taken from thee perforce without thy will now thou o my girl art the youngest and dearest of my daughters and the most affectionate of them to me and lookye thou art about to journey to thy sister and i know not what may befal thee from her so go thou not but return to thy palace but when the princess heard her fathers words her heart fluttered and she feared for her children and bent earthwards her head awhile then she raised it and said to her sire o king queen nur alhuda hath made ready for me an entertainment and awaiteth my coming to her hour by hour these four years she hath not seen me and if i delay to visit her she will be wroth with me the utmost of my stay with her shall be a month and then i will return to thee besides who is the mortal who can travel our land and make his way to the islands of wak who can gain access to the white country and the black mountain and come to the land of camphor and the castle of crystal and how shall he traverse the island of birds and the wady of wild beasts and the valley of the jann and enter our islands if any stranger came hither he would be drowned in the seas of destruction so be of good cheer and eyes without a tear anent my journey for none may avail to tread our earth and she ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and eighteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the princess ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart and bade a thousand horse escort her to the river and abide there till she entered her sisters city and palace and returned to them when they should take her and carry her back to him moreover he charged her tarry with her sister but two days and return to him in haste and she answered hearing and obedience then rising up she went forth and he with her and farewelled her now his words had sunken deep into her heart and she feared for her children but it availeth not to fortify herself by any device against the onset of destiny so she set out and fared on diligently three days till she came to the river and pitched her tents on its bank then she crossed the stream with some of her counsellors pages and suite and going up to the city and the palace went in to queen nur alhuda with whom she found her children who ran to her weeping and crying out o our father at this the tears railed from her eyes and she wept then she strained them to her bosom saying what have you seen your sire at this time would the hour had never been in which i left him if i knew him to be in the house of the world i would carry you to him then she bemoaned herself and her husband and her children weeping and reciting these couplets

when her sister saw her fold her children to her bosom saying tis i who have done thus with myself and my children and have ruined my own house she saluted her not but said to her o whore whence haddest thou these children say hast thou married unbeknown to thy sire or hast thou committed fornicationfn157 an thou have played the piece it behoveth thou be exemplarily punished and if thou have married sans our knowledge why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from thy sire and bring them hither—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

       nbsp     anywise to find escape by flight
i have recourse to thee t annul what they have done  thou art

then wept she grievously till she fell down in a swoon and presently coming to herself repeated these two coupletsfn158

       nbsp     though deemed i neer to find escape

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentieth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when queen nur alhuda ordered into the presence her sister princess manar alsana they set her between her hands and she pinioned as she was recited the verses aforesaid then the queenfn159 sent for a ladder of wood and made the eunuchs lay her on her back with her arms spread out and bind her with cords thereto after which she bared her head and wound her hair about the ladderrungs and indeed all pity for her was rooted out from her heart when manar alsana saw herself in this state of abjection and humiliation she cried out and wept but none succoured her then said she to the queen o my sister how is thy heart hardened against me hast thou no mercy on me nor pity on these little children but her words only hardened her sisters heart and she insulted her saying o wanton o harlot allah have no ruth on whoso sueth for thee how should i have compassion on thee o traitress replied manar alsana who lay stretched on the ladder i appeal from thee to the lord of the heavens concerning that wherewith thou revilest me and whereof i am innocent by allah i have done no whoredom but am lawfully married to him and my lord knoweth an i speak sooth or not indeed my heart is wroth with thee by reason of thine excessive hardheartedness against me how canst thou cast at me the charge of harlotry without knowledge but my lord will deliver me from thee and if that whoredom whereof thou accusest me be true may he presently punish me for it quoth nur alhuda after a few moments of reflection how durst thou bespeak me thus and rose and beat her till she fainted awayfn160 whereupon they sprinkled water on her face till she revived and in truth her charms were wasted for excess of beating and the straitness of her bonds and the sore insults she had suffered then she recited these two couplets

if aught ive sinned in sinful way  or done ill deed and gone
astray
the past repent i and i come  to you and for your pardon pray
when nur alhuda heard these lines her wrath redoubled and she said to her wilt speak before me in verse o whore and seek to excuse thyself for the mortal sins thou hast sinned twas my desire that thou shouldst return to thy husband that i might witness thy wickedness and matchless brazenfacedness for thou gloriest in thy lewdness and wantonness and mortal heinousness then she called for a palmstick and whenas they brought the jaríd she arose and baring arms to elbows beat her sister from head to foot after which she called for a whip of plaited thongs wherewith if one smote an elephant he would start off at full speed and came down therewith on her back and her stomach and every part of her body till she fainted when the old woman shawahi saw this she fled forth from the queens presence weeping and cursing her but nur alhuda cried out to her eunuchs saying fetch her to me so they ran after her and seizing her brought her back to the queen who bade throw her on the ground and making them lay hold of her rose and took the whip with which she beat her till she swooned away when she said to her waitingwomen drag this illomened beldam forth on her face and put her out and they did as she bade them so far concerning them but as regards hasan he walked on beside the river in the direction of the desert distracted troubled and despairing of life and indeed he was dazed and knew not night from day for stress of affliction he ceased not faring on thus till he came to a tree whereto he saw a scroll hanging so he took it and found written thereon these couplets

when in thy mothers womb thou wast  i cast thy case the
       nbsp   bestest best
and turned her heart to thee so she  fosterèd thee on fondest
       nbsp    breast
we will suffice thee in whateer  shall cause thee trouble or
       nbsp   unrest
well aid thee in thine enterprise  so rise and bow to our
       nbsp  behest

when he had ended reading this scroll he made sure of deliverance from trouble and of winning reunion with those he loved then he walked forward a few steps and found himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein there was none to company with him upon which his heart sank within him for horror and loneliness and his sidemuscles trembled for that fearsome place and he recited these couplets

o zephyr of morn an thou pass where the dear ones dwell  bear
       nbsp   greeting of lover who ever in lovelonging wones
and tell them im pledged to yearning and pawned to pine  and
       nbsp    the might of my passion all passion of lovers unthrones
their sympathies haply shall breathe in a breeze like thee  and
       nbsp    quicken forthright this framework of rotting bonesfn161

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentyfirst night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan read the scroll he was certified of deliverance from his trouble and made sure of winning reunion with those he loved then he walked forward a couple of steps and stopped finding himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein was none to company with him so he wept sore and recited the verses before mentioned then he walked on a few steps farther beside the river till he came upon two little boys of the sons of the sorcerers before whom lay a rod of copper graven with talismans and beside it a skullcapfn162 of leather made of three gores and wroughten in steel with names and characts the cap and rod were upon the ground and the boys were disputing and beating each other till the blood ran down between them whilst each cried none shall take the wand but i so hasan interposed and parted them saying what is the cause of your contention and they replied o uncle be thou judge of our case for allah the most high hath surely sent thee to do justice between us quoth hasan tell me your case and i will judge between you and quoth one of them we twain are brothersgerman and our sire was a mighty magician who dwelt in a cave on yonder mountain he died and left us this cap and rod and my brother saith none shall have the rod but i whilst i say the like so be thou judge between us and deliver us each from other hasan asked what is the difference between the rod and the cap and what is their value the rod appears to be worth six coppersfn163 and the cap three whereto they answered thou knowest not their properties and what are their properties each of them hath a wonderful secret virtue wherefore the rod is worth the revenue of all the islands of wak and their provinces and dependencies and the cap the like by allah o my sons discover to me their secret virtues so they said o uncle they are extraordinary for our father wrought an hundred and thirty and five years at their contrivance till he brought them to perfection and ingrafted them with secret attributes which might serve him extraordinary services and engraved them after the likeness of the revolving sphere and by their aid he dissolved all spells and when he had made an end of their fashion death which all needs must suffer overtook him now the hidden virtue of the cap is that whoso setteth it on his head is concealed from all folks eyes nor can any see him whilst it remaineth on his head and that of the rod is that whoso owneth it hath authority over seven tribes of the jinn who all serve the order and ordinance of the rod and whenever he who possesseth it smiteth therewith on the ground their kings come to do him homage and all the jinn are at his service now when hasan heard these words he bowed his head groundwards awhile then said in himself by allah i shall conquer every foe by means of this rod and cap inshallah and i am worthier of them both than these two boys so i will go about forthright to get them from the twain by craft that i may use them to free myself and my wife and children from yonder tyrannical queen and then we will depart from this dismal stead whence there is no deliverance for mortal man nor flight doubtless allah caused me not to fall in with these two lads but that i might get the rod and cap from them then he raised his head and said to the two boys if ye would have me decide the case i will make trial of you and see what each of you deserveth he who overcometh his brother shall have the rod and he who faileth shall have the cap they repliedo uncle we depute thee to make trial of us and do thou decide between us as thou deems fit hasan asked will ye hearken to me and have regard to my words and they answered yes then said he i will take a stone and throw it and he who outrunneth his brother thereto and picketh it up shall take the rod and the other who is outraced shall take the cap and they said we accept and consent to this thy proposal then hasan took a stone and threw it with his might so that it disappeared from sight the two boys ran under and after it and when they were at a distance he donned the cap and hending the rod in hand removed from his place that he might prove the truth of that which the boys had said with regard to their scant properties the younger outran the elder and coming first to the stone took it and returned with it to the place where they had left hasan but found no signs of him so he called to his brother saying where is the man who was to be umpire between us quoth the other i espy him not neither wot i whether he hath flown up to heaven above or sunk into earth beneath then they sought for him but saw him not though all the while he was standing in his stead hard by them so they abused each other saying rod and cap are both gone they are neither mine nor thine and indeed our father warned us of this very thing but we forgot whatso he said then they retraced their steps and hasan also entered the city wearing the cap and bearing the rod and none saw him now when he was thus certified of the truth of their speech he rejoiced with exceeding joy and making the palace went up into the lodging of shawahi who saw him not because of the cap then he walked up to a shelffn164 over her head upon which were vessels of glass and chinaware and shook it with his hand so that what was thereon fell to the ground the old woman cried out and beat her face then she rose and restored the fallen things to their placesfn165 saying in herself by allah methinks queen nur alhuda hath sent a satan to torment me and he hath tricked me this trick i beg allah almighty deliver me from her and preserve me from her wrath for o lord if she deal thus abominably with her halfsister beating and hanging her dear as she is to her sire how

there remained not aught save a fluttering breath and an eye
       nbsp    whose owner is confounded
and a desirous lover whose bowels are burned with fire
       nbsp     notwithstanding which she is silent
the exulting foe pitieth her at the sight of her alas for her
       nbsp     whom the exulting foe pitieth

when hasan saw her in this state of torment and misery and ignominy and infamy he wept till he fainted and when he recovered he saw his children playing and their mother aswoon for excess of pain so he took the cap from his head and the children saw him and cried out o our father then he covered his head again and the princess came to herself hearing their cry but saw only her children weeping and shrieking o our father when she heard them name their sire and weep her heart was broken and her vitals rent asunder and she said to them what maketh you in mind of your father at this time and she wept sore and cried out from a bursten liver and an aching bosom where are ye and where is your father then she recalled the days of her union with hasan and what had befallen her since her desertion of him and wept with sore weeping till her cheeks were seared and furrowed and her face was drowned in a briny flood her tears ran down and wetted the ground and she had not a hand loose to wipe them from her cheeks whilst the flies fed their fill on her skin and she found no helper but weeping and no solace but improvising verses then she repeated these couplets

i call to mind the partingday that rent our loves in twain
       nbsp     when as i turned away the tears in very streams did rain
the cameleer urged on his beasts with them what while i found
       nbsp    nor strength nor fortitude nor did my heart with me remain
yea back i turned unknowing of the road nor might shake off the
       nbsp    trance of grief and longing love that numbed my heart and
       nbsp    brain
and worst of all betided me on my return was one who came to
       nbsp    me in lowly guise to glory in my pain
since the belovèds gone o soul forswear the sweet of life nor
       nbsp     covet its continuance for wanting him twere vain
list o my friend unto the tale of love and god forbid that i
       nbsp     should speak and that thy heart to hearken should not deign
as twere el asmaï himself of passion i discourse fancies rare
       nbsp     and marvellous linked in an endless chainfn167

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentythird night

she continued when hasan went in to his wife he saw his children and heard her repeating the verses afore mentionedfn168 then she turned right and left seeking the cause of her childrens crying out o our father but saw no one and marvelled that her sons should name their sire at that time and call upon him but when hasan heard her verses he wept till he swooned away and the tears railed down his cheeks like rain then he drew near the children and raised the cap from his head unseen of his wife whereupon they saw him and they knew him and cried out saying o our father their mother fell aweeping again when she heard them name their sires name and said there is no avoiding the doom which almighty allah hath decreed adding o strange what garreth them think of their father at this time and call upon him albeit it is not of their wont then she wept and recited these couplets

the land of lamping moon is bare and drear  o eyne of me pour
       nbsp   forth the brimming tear
they marched how shall i now be patient  that i nor heart nor
       nbsp   patience own i swear
o ye who marched yet bide in heart of me  will you o lords of
       nbsp    me return to that we were
what harm if they return and i enjoy  meeting and they had ruth
       nbsp    on tears of care
upon the partingday they dimmed these eyne  for sad surprise
       nbsp    and lit the flames that flare
sore longed i for their stay but fortune stayed  longings and
       nbsp    turned my hope to mere despair
return to us o love by allah deign  enow of tears have
       nbsp    flowed for absencebane

then hasan could no longer contain himself but took the cap from his head whereupon his wife saw him and recognising him screamed a scream which startled all in the palace and said to him how camest thou hither from the sky hast thou dropped or through the earth hast thou come up and her eyes brimmed with tears and hasan also wept quoth she o man this be no time for tears or blame fate hath had its course and the sight was blinded and the pen hath run with what was ordained of allah when time was begun so allah upon thee whencesoever thou comest go hide lest any espy thee and tell my sister and she do thee and me die answered he o my lady and lady of all queens i have adventured myself and come hither and either i will die or i will deliver thee from this strait and travel with thee and my children to my country despite the nose of this thy wickedest sister but as she heard his words she smiled and for awhile fell to shaking her head and said far o my fife far is it from the power of any except allah almighty to deliver me from this my strait save thyself by flight and wend thy ways and cast not thyself into destruction for she hath conquering hosts none may withstand given that thou tookest me and wentest forth how canst thou make thy country and escape from these islands and the perils of these awesome places verily thou hast seen on thy way hither the wonders the marvels the dangers and the terrors of the road such as none may escape not even one of the rebel jinns depart therefore forthright and add not cark to my cark and care to my care neither do thou pretend to rescue me from this my plight for who shall carry me to thy country through all these vales and thirsty wolds and fatal steads rejoined hasan by thy life o light of mine eyes i will not depart this place nor fare but with thee quoth she o man how canst thou avail unto this thing and what manner of man art thou thou knowest not what thou sayest none can escape from these realms even had he command over jinns ifrits magicians chiefs of tribes and marids save thyself and leave me perchance allah will bring about good after ill answered hasan o lady of fair ones i came not save to deliver thee with this rod and with this cap and he told her what had befallen him with the two boys but whilst he was speaking behold up came the queen and heard their speech now when he was ware of her he donned the cap and was hidden from sight and she entered and said to the princess o wanton who is he with whom thou wast talking answered manar alsanar who is with me that should talk with me except these children then the quee took the whip and beat her whilst hasan stood by and looked on nor did she leave beating her till she fainted whereupon she bade transport her to another place so they loosed her and carried her to another chamber whilst hasan followed unseen there they cast her down senseless and stood gazing upon her till she revived and recited these coupletsfn169

i have sorrowed on account of our disunion with a sorrow that
       nbsp    made the tears to overflow from my eyelids
and i vowed that if fortune reunite us i would never again
       nbsp  mention our separation
and i would say to the envious die ye with regret by allah i
       nbsp    have now attained my desire
joy hath overwhelmed me to such a degree that by its excess it
       nbsp    hath made me weep
o eye how hath weeping become thy habit thou weepest in joy as
       nbsp   well as in sorrows

when she ceased her verse the slavegirls went out from her and hasan took off the cap whereupon his wife said to him see o man all this befel me not save by reason of my having rebelled against thee and transgressed thy commandment and gone forth without thy leavefn170 so allah upon thee blame me not for my sins and know that women never wot a mans worth till they have lost him indeed i have offended and done evil but i crave pardon of allah almighty for whatso i did and if he reunite us i will never again gainsay thee in aught no never—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentyfourth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasans wife besought pardon of him saying blame me not for my sin and indeed i crave mercy of allah almighty quoth hasan and indeed his heart ached for her twas not thou that wast in fault nay the fault was mine and mine only for i fared forth and left thee with one who knew not thy rank neither thy worth nor thy degree but know o beloved of my heart and fruit of my vitals and light of mine eyes that allah blessed be he hath ordained to me power of releasing thee so say me wouldst thou have me carry thee to thy fathers home there to accomplish what allah decreeth unto thee or wilt thou forthright depart with me to mine own country now that relief is come to thee quoth she who can deliver me save the lord of the heavens go to thy motherland and put away from thee false hope for thou knowest not the perils of these parts which an thou obey me not soon shalt thou sight and she improvised these couplets

then wept she and her children and the handmaidens heard them so they came in to them and found them weeping but saw not hasan with them wherefore they wept for ruth of them and damned queen nur alhuda then hasan took patience till night came on and her guards had gone to their sleepingplaces when he arose and girded his waist then went up to her and loosing her kissed her on the head and between the eyes and pressed her to his bosom saying how long have we wearied for our motherland and for reunion there is this our meeting in sleep or on wake then he took up the elder boy and she took up the younger and they went forth the palace and allah veiled them with the veil of his protection so that they came safe to the outer gate which closed the entrance to the queens serraglio but finding it locked from without hasan said there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verily we are allahs and unto him shall we return with this they despaired of escape and hasan beat hand upon hand saying o dispeller of dolours indeed i had bethought me of every thing and considered its conclusion but this and now when it is daybreak they will take us and what device have we in this case and he recited the following two coupletsfn171

thou madest fair thy thought of fate whenas the days were fair
       nbsp  and fearedst not the unknown ills that they to thee might
       nbsp bring
the nights were fair and calm to thee thou wast deceived by
       nbsp  them for in the peace of night is born full many a
       nbsp  troublous thing

then hasan wept and his wife wept for his weeping and for the abasement she had suffered and the cruelties of time and fortune

baulks me my fate as tho she were my foe  each day she
       nbsp    showeth me new cark and care
fate when i aim at good brings clear reverse  and lets foul
       nbsp    morrow wait on day thats fair
and also these

irks me my fate and clean unknows that i  of my high worth her
       nbsp     shifts and shafts despise
she nights parading what illwill she works  i night parading
       nbsp     patience to her eyes

then his wife said to him by allah there is no relief for us but to kill ourselves and be at rest from this great and weary travail else we shall suffer grievous torment on the morrow at this moment behold they heard a voice from without the door say by allah o my lady manar alsana i will not open to thee and thy husband hasan except ye obey me in whatso i shall say to you when they heard these words they were silent for excess of fright and would have returned whence they came when lo the voice spake again saying what aileth you both to be silent and answer me not therewith they knew the speaker for the old woman shawahi lady of calamities and said to her whatsoever thou biddest us that will we do but first open the door to us this being no time for talk replied she by allah i will not open to you until ye both swear to me that you will take me with you and not leave me with yonder whore so whatever befalleth you shall befal me and if ye escape i shall escape and if ye perish i shall perish for yonder abominable woman tribadefn172 that she is entreateth me with indignity and still tormenteth me on your account and thou o my daughter knowest my worth now recognising her they trusted in her and sware to her an oath such as contented her whereupon she opened the door to them and they fared forth and found her riding on a greek jar of red earthenware with a rope of palmfibres about its neckfn173 which rolled under her and ran faster than a najdi colt and she came up to them and said follow me and fear naught for i know forty modes of magic by the least of which i could make this city a dashing sea swollen with clashing billows and ensorcel each damsel therein to a fish and all before dawn but i was not able to work aught of my mischief for fear of the king her father and of regard to her sisters for that they are formidable by reason of their many guards and tribesmen and servants however soon will i show you wonders of my skill in witchcraft and now let us on relying upon the blessing of allah and his good aid now hasan and his wife rejoiced in this making sure of escape —and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentyfifth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan and his wife accompanied by the ancient dame shawahi fared forth from the palace they made sure of deliverance and they walked on till they came without the city when he fortified his heart and smiting the earth with the rod cried ho ye servants of these names appear to me and acquaint me with your conditions thereupon the earth clave asunder and out came tenfn174 ifrits with their feet in the bowels of the earth and their heads in the clouds they kissed the earth three times before hasan and said as with one voice adsumus here are we at thy service o our lord and ruler over us what dost thou bid us do for we hear and obey thy commandment an thou wilt we will dry thee up seas and remove mountains from their places so hasan rejoiced in their words and at their speedy answer to his evocation then taking courage and bracing up his resolution he said to them who are ye and what be your names and your races and to what tribes and clans and companies appertain ye they kissed the earth once more and answered as with one voice saying we are seven kings each ruling over seven tribes of the jinn of all conditions and satans and marids flyers and divers dwellers in mountains and wastes and wolds and haunters of the seas so bid us do whatso thou wilt for we are thy servants and thy slaves and whoso possesseth this rod hath dominion over an our necks and we owe him obedience now when hasan heard this he rejoiced with joy exceeding as did his wife and the old woman and presently he said to the kings of the jinn i desire of you that ye show me your tribes and hosts and guards o our lord answered they if we show thee our tribes we fear for thee and these who are with thee for their name is legion and they are various in form and fashion figure and favour some of us are heads sans bodies and others bodies sans heads and others again are in the likeness of wild beasts and ravening lions however if this be thy will there is no help but we first show thee those of us who are like unto wild beasts but o our lord what wouldst thou of us at this present quoth hasan i would have you carry me forthwith to the city of baghdad me and my wife and this honest woman but hearing his words they hung down their heads and were silent whereupon hasan asked them why do ye not reply and they answered as with one voice o our lord and ruler over us we are of the covenant of solomon son of david on the twain be peace and he sware us in that we would bear none of the sons of adam on our backs since which time we have borne no mortal on back or shoulder but we will straightway harness thee horses of the jinn that shall carry thee and thy company to thy country hasan enquired how far are we from baghdad and they seven years journey for a diligent horseman hasan marvelled at this and said to them then how came i hither in less than a year and they said allah softened to thee the hearts of his pious servants else hadst thou never come to this country nor hadst thou set eyes on these regions no never for the shaykh abd alkaddus who mounted thee on the elephant and the magical horse traversed with thee in ten days three years journey for a wellgirt rider and the ifrit dahnash to whom the shaykh committed thee carried thee a three years march in a day and a night all which was of the blessing of allah almighty for that the shaykh abu alruwaysh is of the seed of asaf bin barkhiyáfn175 and knoweth the most great name of allahfn176 moreover from baghdad to the palace of the damsels is a years journey and this maketh up the seven years when hasan heard this he marvelled with exceeding marvel and cried glory be to god facilitator of the hard fortifier of the weak heart approximator of the far and humbler of every froward tyrant who hath eased us of every accident and carried me to these countries and subjected to me these creatures and reunited me with my wife and children i know not whether i am asleep or awake or if i be sober or drunken then he turned to the jinn and asked when ye have mounted me upon your steeds in how many days will they bring us to baghdad and they answered they will carry you thither under the year but not till after ye have endured terrible perils and hardships and horrors and ye have traversed thirsty wadys and frightful wastes and horrible steads without number and we cannot promise thee safety o our lord from the people of these islands—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the jann said to hasan we cannot promise thee safety o our lord from this islandry nor from the mischief of the supreme king and his enchanters and warlocks it may be they will overcome us and take you from us and we fall into affliction with them and all to whom the tidings shall come after this will say to us ye are wrongdoers how could ye go against the supreme king and carry a mortal out of his dominions and eke the kings daughter with him adding wert thou alone with us the thing were light but he who conveyed thee hither is capable to carry thee back to thy country and reunite thee with thine own people forthright and in readiest plight so take heart and put thy trust in allah and fear not for we are at thy service to convey thee to thy country hasan thanked them therefor and said allah requite you with good but now make haste with the horses they replied we hear and we obey and struck the ground with their feet whereupon it opened and they disappeared within it and were absent awhile after which they suddenly reappeared with three horses saddled and bridled and on each saddlebow a pair of saddlebags with a leathern bottle of water in one pocket and the other full of provaunt so hasan mounted one steed and took a child before him whilst his wife mounted a second and took the other child before her then the old woman alighted from the jar and bestrode the third horse and they rode on without ceasing all night at break of day they turned aside from the road and made for the mountain whilst their tongues ceased not to name allah then they fared on under the highland all that day till hasan caught sight of a black object afar as it were a tall column of smoke atwisting skywards so he recited somewhat of the koran and holy writ and sought refuge with allah from satan the stoned the black thing grew plainer as they drew near and when hard by it they saw that it was an ifrit with a head like a huge dome and tusks like grapnels and jaws like a lane and nostrils like ewers and ears like leathern targes and mouth like a cave and teeth like pillars of stone and hands like winnowing forks and legs like masts his head was in the cloud and his feet in the bowels of the earth had plowed whenas hasan gazed upon him he bowed himself and kissed the ground before him saying o hasan have no fear of me for i am the chief of the dwellers in this land which is the first of the isles of wak and i am a moslem and an adorer of the one god i have heard of you and your coming and when i knew of your case i desired to depart from the land of the magicians to another land void of inhabitants and far from men and jinn that i might dwell there alone and worship allah till my fated end came upon me so i wish to accompany you and be your guide till ye fare forth of the wak islands and i will not appear save at night and do ye hearten your hearts on my account for i am a moslem even as ye are moslems when hasan heard the ifrits words he rejoiced with exceeding joy and made sure of deliverance and he said to him allah requite thee weal go with us relying upon the blessing of allah so the ifrit forewent them and they followed talking and making merry for their hearts were pleased and their breasts were eased and hasan fell to telling his wife all that had befallen him and all the hardships he had undergone whilst she excused herself to him and told him in turn all she had seen and suffered they ceased not faring all that night—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that they ceased not faring all that night and the horses bore them like the blinding leven and when the day rose all put their hands to the saddlebags and took forth provaunt which they ate and water which they drank then they sped diligently on their way preceded by the ifrit who turned aside with them from the beaten track into another road till then untrodden along the seashores and they ceased not faring on without stopping across wadys and wolds a whole month till on the thirtyfirst day there arose before them a dustcloud that walled the world and darkened the day and when hasan saw this he was confused and turned pale and more so when a frightful crying and clamour struck their ears there upon the old woman said to him o my son this is the army of the wak islands that hath overtaken us and presently they will lay violent hands on us hasan asked what shall i do o my mother and she answered strike the earth with the rod he did so whereupon the seven kings presented themselves and saluted him with the salam kissing ground before him and saying fear not neither grieve hasan rejoiced at these words and answered them saying well said o princes of the jinn and the ifrits this is your time quoth they get ye up to the mountaintop thou and thy wife and children and she who is with thee and leave us to deal with them for we know that you all are in the right and they in the wrong and allah will aid us against them so hasan and his wife and children and the old woman dismounted and dismissing the horses ascended the flank of the mountain—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and twentyeighth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasan with his wife his children and the ancient dame ascended the mountainflank after they had dismissed the coursers presently up came queen nur alhuda with the troops right and left and the captains went round about among the host and ranged them rank by rank in battle array then the hosts charged down upon each other and clashed together the twain with a mighty strain the brave pressed on amain and the coward to fly was fain and the jinn cast flames of fire from their mouths whilst the smoke of them rose up to the confines of the sky and the two armies appeared and disappeared the champions fought and heads flew from trunks and the blood ran in rills nor did brand leave to play and blood to flow and battle fire to flow till the murk o night came when the two hosts drew apart and alighting from their steeds rested upon the field by the fires they had kindled therewith the seven kings went up to hasan and kissed the earth before him he pressed forwards to meet them and thanked them and prayed allah to give them the victory and asked them how they had fared with the queens troops quoth they they will not withstand us more than three days for we had the better of them today taking some two thousand of them prisoners and slaying of them much folk whose compt may not be told so be of good cheer and broad of breast then they farewelled him and went down to look after the safety of their troops and they ceased not to keep up the fires till the morning rose with its sheen and shone when the fightingmen mounted their horses of noble strain and smote one another with thinedged skean and with brawn of bill they thrust amain nor did they cease that day battle to darraign moreover they passed the night on horseback clashing together like dashing seas raged among them the fires of war and they stinted not from battle and jar till the armies of wak were defeated and their power broken and their courage quelled their feet slipped and whither they fled soever defeat was before them wherefore they turned tail and of flight began to avail but the most part of them were slain and their queen and her chief officers and the grandees of her realm were captive taen when the morning morrowed the seven kings presented themselves before hasan and set for him a throne of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels and he sat down thereon they also set thereby a throne of ivory plated with glittering gold for the princess manar alsana and another for the ancient dame shawahi zat aldawahi then they brought before them the prisoners and among the rest queen nur alhuda with elbows pinioned and feet fettered whom when shawahi saw she said to her thy recompense o harlot o tyrant shall be that two bitches be starved and two mares stinted of water till they be athirst then shalt thou be bound to the mares tails and these driven to the river with the bitches following thee that they may rend thy skin and after thy flesh shall be cut off and given them to eat how couldst thou do with thy sister such deed o strumpet seeing that she was lawfully married after the ordinance of allah and of his apostle for there is no monkery in alislam and marriage is one of the institutions of the apostles on whom be the peacefn177 nor were women created but for men then hasan commanded to put all the captives to the sword and the old woman cried out saying slay them all and spare nonefn178 but when princess manar alsana saw her sister in this plight a bondswoman and in fetters she wept over her and said o my sister who is this hath conquered us and made us captives in our own country quoth nur alhuda verily this is a mighty matter indeed this man hasan hath gotten the mastery over us and allah hath given him dominion over us and over all our realm and he hath overcome us us and the kings of the jinn and quoth her sister indeed allah aided him not against you nor did he overcome you nor capture you save by means of this cap and rod so nur alhuda was certified and assured that he had conquered her by means thereof and humbled herself to her sister till she was moved to ruth for her and said to her husband what wilt thou do with my sister behold she is in thy hands and she hath done thee no misdeed that thou shouldest punish her replied hasan her torturing of thee was misdeed enow but she answered saying she hath excuse for all she did with me as for thee thou hast set my fathers heart on fire for the loss of me and what will be his case if he lose my sister also and he said to her tis thine to decide do whatso thou wilt so she bade loose her sister and the rest of the captives and they did her bidding then she went up to queen nur alhuda and embraced her and they wept together a long while after which quoth the queen o my sister bear me not malice for that i did with thee and quoth manar alsana o my sister this was foreordained to me by fate then they sat on the couch talking and manar alsana made peace between the old woman and her sister after the goodliest fashion and their hearts were set at ease thereupon hasan dismissed the servants of the rod thanking them for the succour which they had afforded him against his foes and manar alsana related to her sister all that had befallen her with hasan her husband and every thing he had suffered for her sake saying o my sister since he hath done these deeds and is possessed of this might and allah almighty hath gifted him with such exceeding prowess that he hath entered our country and beaten thine army and taken thee prisoner and defied our father the supreme king who hath dominion over all the princes of the jinn it behoveth us to fail not of what is due to him replied nur alhuda by allah o my sister thou sayest sooth in whatso thou tellest me of the marvels which this man hath seen and suffered and none may fail of respect to him but was all this on thine account o my sister—and shahrazad perceived

when it was the eight hundred and thirtieth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that hasan began relating to shaykh abd alkaddus and shaykh abu alruwaysh who sat chattting in the cave all that had passed first and last till he came to the tale of the rod and cap where upon quoth abd alkaddus o my son thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further need of the two now we were the means of thy winning to the islands of wak and i have done thee kindness for the sake of my nieces the daughters of my brother wherefore i beg thee of thy bounty and favour to give me the rod and the shaykh abu alruwaysh the cap when hasan heard this he hung down his head being ashamed to reply i will not give them to you and said in his mind indeed these two shaykhs have done me great kindness and were the means of my winning to the islands of wak and but for them i had never made the place nor delivered my children nor had i gotten me this rod and cap so he raised his head and answered yes i will give them to you but o my lords i fear lest the supreme king my wifes father come upon me with his commando and combat with me in my own country and i be unable to repel them for want of the rod and the cap replied abd alkaddus fear not o my son we will continually succour thee and keep watch and ward for thee in this place and whosoever shall come against thee from thy wifes father or any other him we will fend off from thee wherefore be thou of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and feel naught whatsoever of fear for no harm shall come to thee when hasan heard this he was abashed and gave the cap to abu alruwaysh saying to abd alkaddus accompany me to my own country and i will give thee the rod at this the two elders rejoiced with exceeding joy and made him ready riches and treasures which beggar all description he abode with them three days at the end of which he set out again and the shaykh abd alkaddus made ready to depart with him so he and his wife mounted their beasts and abd alkaddus whistled when behold a mighty big elephant trotted up with fore hand and feet on amble from the heart of the desert and he took it and mounted it then they farewelled abu alruwaysh who disappeared within his cavern and they fared on across country traversing the land in its length and breadth wherever abd alkaddus guided them by a short cut and an easy way till they drew near the land of the princesses whereupon hasan rejoiced at finding himself once more near his mother and praised allah for his safe return and reunion with his wife and children after so many hardships and perils and thanked him for his favours and bounties reciting these couplets

haply shall allah deign us twain unite  and lockt in strict
       nbsp    embrace well hail the light
and wonders that befel me ill recount  and all i suffered from
       nbsp    the severanceblight
and fain ill cure mine eyes by viewing you  for ever yearned my

i hid a tale for you my heart within  which when we meet o morn
       nbsp    ill fain recite
ill blame you for the deeds by you were done  but while blame
       nbsp    endeth love shall stay in site

hardly had he made an end of these verses when he looked and behold there rose to view the green domefn179 and the jetting fount and the emerald palace and the mountain of clouds showed to them from afar whereupon quoth abd alkaddus rejoice o hasan in good tidings tonight shalt thou be the guest of my nieces at this he joyed with exceeding joy and as also did his wife and they alighted at the domed pavilion where they took their restfn180 and ate and drank after which they mounted horse again and rode on till they came upon the palace as they drew near the princesses who were daughters of the king brother to shaykh abd alkaddus came forth to meet them and saluted them and their uncle who said to them o daughters of my brother behold i have accomplished the need of this your brother hasan and have helped him to regain his wife and children so they embraced him and gave him joy of his return in safety and health and of his reunion with his wife and children and it was a day of festivalfn181 with them then came forward hasans sister the youngest princess and embraced him weeping with sore weeping whilst he also wept for his long desolation after which she complained to him of that which she had suffered for the pangs of separation and weariness of spirit in his absence and recited these two couplets

after thy faring never chanced ispy  a shape but did thy form
       nbsp     therein descry
nor closed mine eyes in sleep but thee i saw  een as though
       nbsp     dwelling twixt the lid and eye

when she had made an end of her verses she rejoiced with joy exceeding and hasan said to her o my sister i thank none in this matter save thyself over all thy sisters and may allah almighty vouchsafe thee aidance and countenance then he related to her all that had past in his journey from first to last and all that he had undergone telling her what had betided him with his wifes sister and how he had delivered his wife and wees and he also described to her all that he had seen of marvels and grievous perils even to how queen nur alhuda would have slain him and his spouse and children and none saved them from her but the lord the most high moreover he related to her the adventure of the cap and the rod and how abd alkaddus and abu alruwaysh had asked for them and he had not agreed to give them to the twain save for her sake wherefore she thanked him and blessed him wishing him long life and he cried by allah i shall never forget all the kindness thou hast done me from incept to conclusion—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eight hundred and thirtyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan foregathered with the princesses he related to his sister all that he had endured and said to her never will i forget what thou hast done for me from incept to conclusion then she turned to his wife manar alsana and embraced her and pressed her children to her breast saying to her o daughter of the supreme king was there no pity in thy bosom that thou partedst him and his children and settedst his heart on fire for them say me didst thou desire by this deed that he should die the princess laughed and answered thus was it ordained of allah extolled and exalted be he and whoso beguileth folk him shall allah begulefn182 then they set on somewhat of meat and drink and they all ate and drank and made merry they abode thus ten days in feast and festival mirth and merrymaking at the end of which time hasan prepared to continue his journey so his sister rose and made him ready riches and rarities such as defy description then she strained him to her bosom because of leavetaking and threw her arms round his neck whilst he recited on her account these couplets

the solace of lovers is naught but far  and parting is naught
       nbsp   save grief singular
and illwill and absence are naught but woe  and the victims of
       nbsp  love naught but martyrs are
and how tedious is night to the loving wight  from his true love
       nbsp   parted neath evening star
his tears course over his cheeks and so  he cries o tears be
       nbsp     there more to flow

with this hasan gave the rod to shaykh abd alkaddus who joyed therein with exceeding joy and thanking him and securing it mounted and returned to his own place then hasan took horse with his wife and children and departed from the palace of the princesses who went forthfn183 with him to farewell him then they turned back and hasan fared on over wild and wold two months and ten days till he came to the city of baghdad the house of peace and repairing to his home by the private postern which gave upon the open country knocked at the door now his mother for long absence had forsworn sleep and given herself to mourning and weeping and wailing till she fell sick and ate no meat neither took delight in slumber but shed tears night and day she ceased not to call upon her sons name albeit she despaired of his returning to her and as he stood at the door he heard her weeping and reciting these couplets

by allah heal o my lords the unwhole  of wasted frame and
       nbsp     heart worn with dole
an you grant her a meeting tis but your grace  shall whelm in
       nbsp    the boons of the friend her soul
i despair not of union the lord can grant  and to weal of
       nbsp    meeting our woes control

when she had ended her verses she heard her sons voice at the door calling out o mother mother ah fortune hath been kind and hath vouchsafed our reunion hearing his cry she knew his voice and went to the door between belief and misbelief but when she opened it she saw him standing there and with him his wife and children so she shrieked aloud for excess of joy and fell to the earth in a faintingfit hasan ceased not soothing her till she recovered and embraced him then she wept with joy and presently she called his slaves and servants and bade them carry all his baggage into the housefn184 so they brought in every one of the loads and his wife and children entered also whereupon hasans mother went up to the princess and kissed her head and bussed her feet saying o daughter of the supreme king if i have failed of thy due behold i crave pardon of almighty allah then she turned to hasan and said to him o my son what was the cause of this long strangerhood he related to her all his adventures from beginning to end and when she heard tell of all that had befallen him she cried a great cry and fell down afainting at the very mention of his mishaps he solaced her till she came to herself and said by allah o my son thou hast done unwisely in parting with the rod and the cap for hadst thou kept them with the care due to them thou wert master of the whole earth in its breadth and length but praised be allah for thy safety o my son and that of thy wife and children they passed the night in all pleasance and happiness and on the morrow hasan changed his clothes and donning a suit of the richest apparel went down into the bazar and bought black slaves and slavegirls and the richest stuffs and ornaments and furniture such as carpets and costly vessels and all manner other precious things whose like is not found with kings moreover he purchased houses and gardens and estates and so forth and abode with his wife and his children and his mother eating and drinking and pleasuring nor did they cease from all joy of life and its solace till there came to them the destroyer of delights and the severer of societies and glory be to him who hath dominion over the seen and the unseenfn185 who is the living the eternal who dieth not at all and men also recount the adventures of

answer vvlva very interesting to the anthropological student is this excursus of hasan who after all manner of hardships and horrors and risking his life to recover his wife and children breaks out into song on the subject of her privities and it can hardly be taletellers gag as both verse and prose show considerable art in composition see p 348

supplementary note to hasan of bassorah

notep93—there is something wondrous naïve in a lover who when asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour breaks out into versical praises of her parts but even the classical arab authors did not disdain such themes see in alharírí ass of mayyáfarikín where abú zayd laments the impotency of old age in form of a rasy or funeral oration preston p 484 and chenery p 221 it completely deceived sir william jones who inserted it into the chapter de poesi funebri p 527 poeseos asiaticæ commentarii gravely noting hæc elegia non admodum dissimilis esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de sauli et jonathani obitu at que adeò versus iste ubi provocant adversarios nunquam rediit a pugnæ contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto ex hebræoreddi videtur

i need hardly say with captain lockett 226 that this sabb warrior this arabian achilles is the celebrated bonus deus or hellespontiacus of the ancients the oration runs thus—

o folk i have a wondrous tale so rare
much shall it profit hearers wise and ware
i saw in saladyears a potent brave
and sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive
who entered joust and list with hardiment
fearless of risk of victory confident
his vigorous onset straitest places oped
and easy passage through all narrows groped
he neer encountered foe in single fight
but came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright
nor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark—
with fencèd gates defended deep and dark—
when shown his flag without th auspicious cry
aidance from allah and fair victory nigh
thus wise full many a night his part he played
in strength and youthtides stately garb arrayed
dealing to fair young girl delicious joy
and no less welcome to the blooming boy
but time neer ceased to stint his wondrous strength
steadfast and upright as the gallows length
until the nights oerthrew him by their might
and friends contemned him for a feckless wight
nor was a wizard but who wasted skill
over his case nor leach could heal his ill
then he abandoned arms abandoned him
who gave and took salutes so fierce and grim
and now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest
for who lives longest him most ills molest
then see him here he lies on bier for bet—
who will a shroud bestow on stranger dead

a fair measure of the difference between eastern and western manners is afforded by such a theme being treated by their gravest writers and the verses being read and heard by the gravest and most worshipful men whilst amongst us preston and chenery do not dare even to translate them the latter indeed had all that immodest modesty for which english professional society is notable in this xixth century he spoiled by needlessly excluding from a scientific publication mem ras all of my proverbia communia syriaca see unexplored sryia i 364 and every item which had a shade of double entendre but nemesis frequently found him out during his short and obscure rule in printing house square the thunderer was distinguished by two of the foulest indecencies that ever appeared in an english paper
