they say counting stars
you play the part of a soul missing home
were you counting stars
cause you packed your bags had your heart set to roam
when you left for georgia
said your friends didnt want you
but i swear i do
say what we are

verse 2
times not a problem do you think we were moving too fast
guess we werent meant to last
i cant move on from that and
i dont have the words
so ill keep counting stars
inside of my room
inside my room
