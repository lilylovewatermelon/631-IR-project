uh
this might be too real too real

verse 1 drake  ty dolla ign
hold me closer in these
trying times supposed to be mine
baby
i need some help just like anyone else
hold me closer in these
trying times open your eyes
baby
you said you felt something for me talk to em
i dont know when
based on the signals you send
based on the way you apologized
when you came to see me and then then what
you had the nеrve to defend dеfend what
mistakes that you made at the end
you said i was too invested
and thats what had forced you to go and pretend
i swear you crazy
someone thats close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends oh

chorus drake  ty dolla ign

i get along better with your friend oh
and its wrong i know its wrong i know oh

no
you said you felt you said you felt
something thats different from everyone else
you had the nerve to still ask for my help
dug you out ditches you buried yourself ahoh
you said you fell
and i took your word that night in our hotel
one thing about time surely times gonna tell
never had to work for much so you said it yourself ahoh oh
cant let it go cant get this out of me
this shit still bothers me
dont you dare dont you dare
dont say youre proud of me
hurts just unreal to me
now you wanna come crack to me crack crack
three whole years after me
why did you wait til the end

chorus drake  ty dolla ign
trust me this aint bout revenge
but now i get along better with your friend friend
and it dont feel wrong but again
trust me this aint bout revenge
i get along better with your friend
oh and its wrong i know but again
trust me this aint bout revenge
