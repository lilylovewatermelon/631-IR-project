metaphor for a missing moment
pull me in to your perfect circle
one womb one shame one resolve
liberate this will to release us all

chorus
gotta cut away clear away
snip away and sever this
umbilical residue
keeping me from killing you

verse 2
and from pulling you down with me here
i can almost hear you scream

bridge
one more medicated peaceful moment
give me one more medicated peaceful moment
and i dont wanna feel this overwhelming hostility
i dont wanna feel this overwhelming hostility

chorus
gotta cut away clear away
snip away and sever this umbilical residue
gotta cut away clear away
snip away and sever this umbilical residue
keeping me from killing you
outro
snip away and sever this
keeping me from killing youyou might also like13embed"
