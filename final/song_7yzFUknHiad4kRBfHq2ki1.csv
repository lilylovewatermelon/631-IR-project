only when the fates commiserate
do we get a little taste as unique
the libertine know what i mean
hiroshima on a sunday
you had a gift you were a gift
but theres always a goddamn catch
blessing and a curse you made it work
the universe seems so much smaller
legend bastard best friend why
why do the limits have to realign
hero martyr mystery god
he was the best of us

chorus
the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
the world will never know another man as amazing as you

verse 2
never be the same i want the blame
to be assigned to the guiltiest one
it cant be done because the son
was the victim they arrested
im so fucking pissed at all of this
you gotta know that you are sorely missed
miracles are real they help you heal
they make you feel like things will get better
father brother scapegoat why
why did we only get this time
fighter icon skeptic god
stop taking the best of us

i wont let you disappear
i will keep your soul alive if i cant have you here
history may have its share of lunatics and stars

chorus
but the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
the world will never know another man as amazing as you
the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
the world will never know another man as amazing as you

bridge
skeptic skeptic skeptic
skeptic skeptic skeptic
where am i supposed to begin
im killing for the karma again
feed the meter in the machine
believing is the way to be seen
gone are we alone
gone are we alone
gone are we alone
gone were not alone

prechorus
i cant let you disappear
i will keep your soul alive if i cant have you here
we were meant to be the kings
rule the masses run the risks
and keep our systems clean
history may have its share of lunatics and stars
chorus
but the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
the world will never know another man as amazing as you
the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
the world will never know another man as amazing as you

outro
the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
like you
like you13embed"
