tay keith fuck these niggas up

verse 1
i been the type of guy she like since middle school
never thought that id get famous always know that id be cool
couldve been fucked on shawty i just didnt wanna be rude
eliantte diamonds i want the finest for your jewels
and my hitter dem be slidin dont put cameras on my crew
i aint doin too bad im somebody you can google me
i aint never worried bout what they say that they gon to do me
i just put in overtime im doin numbers like its two of me
that was back then times change this a newer me
money conversations at the table i speak fluently
stay away from bad vibes i cant see no nigga doing me
still give a couple thousand even though she would of did it free
they dont treat me like no rapper cause my vibe like im in the streets
im one of the top five it aint too many guys as real as me
i barely get sleep im tryna make sure everybody eats
took a trip to overseas im buyin drip in other currencies
im on fire right now and it aint somethin thats just currently
and a bitch told a lie if she told you she was curvin me
and we all big dawgs aint gon let my people work for me
911 we got a problem its an emergency yeah

chorus
i heard that crime pays uh
they think we thugs cause we got ice im going plain jane
no matter what at least a quarter for my main thing
showed up on forbes i cant complain im tryna maintain
hop off a plane pick up a check then do the same thing
i heard that crime pays
they think we thugs cause we got ice im going plain jane
no matter what at least a quarter for my main thing
showed up on forbes i cant complain im tryna maintain
hop off a plane pick up a check then do the same thing

lately i been diggin your vibe
i can tell by the look in your eyes
that you need to get some shit off your mind
i give you my time give you jets in the sky
have you runnin round in laps for me
i perform when im done you should clap for me
you got problems on your head you can chat with me
have you runnin around the globe chasing racks with me
ms in plastic sometimes im sarcastic
i just like to hear laughter tryna ease all this pain
took off fast i know they hate how i passed em
dont gotta be in the grave they throwin dirt on your name yeah

chorus
i heard that crime pays uh

hop off a plane pick up a check then do the same thing
