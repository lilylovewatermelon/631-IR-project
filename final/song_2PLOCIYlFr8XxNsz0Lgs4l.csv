verse 1
you have to leave just stay for a while
the longer you stay the better the time
you listen to your friends they lie

feelings get caught up in the mind
a shooting star pass by my eye
when i dont know just what to do
she wont blow my high

you wanna stay just stay for long
cause you got the sweetest touch i know

but i dont mind i know youre mine
