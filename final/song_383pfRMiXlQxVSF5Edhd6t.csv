im calling out your name
but ill pretend someones waiting
if youd listen to just what i said
you might take the time to write it down
and call on me
when youre down
i am down
all your cigarettes on the window sill
i dont know if you were once a friend
or just pretending
open up that big old mouth of yours
pills and razors
marked the days as they were
neverending
when youre down
i am down
you should not forget
every time we met
shaking hands like friends
then i swore id never go
id never go alone
then you swore youd never go
youd never go alone
ive got your phone
and now ill call your friends
ill let know them know
that it was all for real
we werent pretending
when youre down
i am down down down down down
you should not forget
every time we met
shaking hands like friends
then i swore id never go
id never go alone
then you swore youd never go
youd never go alone
then i swore i had it all i
swore id go alone
you swore
you always swore
you always swore aloneyou might also likeembed"
