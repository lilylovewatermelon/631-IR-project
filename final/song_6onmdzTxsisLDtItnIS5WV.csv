there lived once in the city of cufafn1 a man called alrabía bin hátim who was one of the chief men of the town a wealthy and a healthy and heaven had vouchsafed him a son whom he named niamah allahfn2 one day being in the slavebrokers mart he saw a woman exposed for sale with a little maid of wonderful beauty and grace on her arm so he beckoned to the broker and asked him how much for this woman and her daughter he answered fifty dinars quoth alrabia write the contract of sale and take the money and give it to her owner then he gave the broker the price and his brokerage and taking the woman and her child carried them to his house now when the daughter of his uncle who was his wife saw the slave she said to her husband o my cousin what is this damsel he replied of a truth i bought her for the sake of the little one on her arm for know that when she groweth up there will not be her like for beauty either in the land of the arabs or the ajams his wife remarked right was thy rede and said to the woman what is thy name she replied o my lady my name is tauflíkfn3 and what is thy daughters name asked she answered the slave saad the happy rejoined her mistress thou sayst sooth thou art indeed happy and happy is he who hath bought thee then quoth she to her husband o my cousin what wilt thou call her and quoth he whatso thou chooses so she said then let us call her naomi and he rejoined good is thy device the little naomi was reared with alrabias son niamah in one cradle so to speak till the twain reached the age of ten and each grew handsomer than the other and the boy used to address her o my sister and she o my brother till they came to that age when alrabia said to niamah o my son naomi is not thy sister but thy slave i bought her in thy name whilst thou wast yet in the cradle so call her no more sister from this day forth quoth niamah if that be so i will take her to wife then he went to his mother and told her of this and she said to him o my son she is thy handmaid so he wedded and went in unto naomi and loved her and twofn4 years passed over them whilst in this condition nor was there in all cufa a fairer girl than naomi or a sweeter or a more graceful as she grew up she learnt the koran and read works of science and excelled in music and playing upon all kinds of instruments and in the beauty of her singing she surpassed all the folk of her time now one day as she sat with her husband in the wine chamber she took the lute tightened the strings and sang these two couplets

while thourt my lord whose bountys my estate  a sword
             whereby my woes to annihilate
recourse i never need to amru or zaydfn5  nor aught save
             thee if way to me grow strait

niamah was charmed with these verses and said to her by my life o naomi sing to us with the tambourine and other instruments so she sang these couplets to a lively measure
by his life who holds my guiding rein i swear  ill meet on
             love ground parlous foe nor care
good sooth ill vex revilers thee obey  and quit my slumbers
             and all joy forswear
and for thy love ill dig in vitals mine  a grave nor shall my
             vitals weet tis there

and niamah exclaimed heaven favoured art thou o naomi but whilst they led thus the most joyous life behold alhajjájfn6 the viceroy of cufa said to himself needs must i contrive to take this girl named naomi and send her to the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwán for he hath not in his palace her like for beauty and sweet singing so he summoned an old woman of the duennas of his wives and said to her go to the house of alrabia and foregather with the girl naomi and combine means to carry her off for her like is not to be found on the face of the earth she promised to do his bidding the next morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and henting in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of yamani manufacture— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman promised to do the bidding of alhajjaj and whenas it was morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devoteefn7 and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and hent in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of yamani manufacture and fared forth crying glory be to allah praised be allah there is no god but the god allah is most great there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great nor did she leave off her lauds and her groaning in prayer whilst her heart was full of guile and wiles till she came to the house of niamah bin alrabia at the hour of noon prayer and knocked at the door the doorkeeper opened and said to her what dost thou want quoth she i am a poor pious woman whom the time of noon prayer hath overtaken and fief would i pray in this blessed place answered the porter o old woman this is no mosque nor oratory but the house of niamah son of al rabia she replied i know there is neither cathedralmosque nor oratory like the house of niamah bin alrabia i am a chamberwoman of the palace of the prince of true believers and am come out for worship and the visitation of holy places but the porter rejoined thou canst not enter and many words passed between them till at last she caught hold and hung to him saying shall the like of me be denied admission to the house of niamah bin alrabia i who have free access to the houses of emirs and grandees anon out came niamah and hearing their loud language laughed and bade the old woman enter after him so she followed him into the presence of naomi whom she saluted after the godliest and goodliest fashion and when she looked on her she was confounded at her exceeding seemliness and said to her o my lady i commend thee to the safeguard of allah who made thee and thy lord fellows in beauty and loveliness then she stood up in the prayer niche and betook herself to inclination and prostration and prayer till day departed and night darkened and starkened when naomi said to her o my mother rest thy legs and feet awhile replied the old woman o my lady whoso seeketh the world to come let him weary him in this world and whoso wearieth not himself in this world shall not attain the dwellings of the just in the world to come then naomi brought her food and said to her eat of my bread and pray heaven to accept my penitence and to have mercy on me but she cried o my lady i am fasting as for thee thou art but a girl and it befitteth thee to eat and drink and make merry allah be indulgent to thee for the almighty saith all shall be punished except him who shall repent and believe and shall work a righteous workfn8 so naomi continued sitting with the old woman in talk and presently said to niamah o my lord conjure this ancient dame to sojourn with us awhile for piety and devotion are imprinted on her countenance quoth he set apart for her a chamber where she may say her prayers and suffer no one to go in to her peradventure allah extolled and exalted be he shall prosper us by the blessing of her presence and never separate us so the old woman passed her night in praying and reciting the koran and when allah caused the morn to dawn she went in to niamah and naomi and giving them good morning said to them i pray allah have you in his holy keeping quoth naomi whither away o my mother my lord hath bidden me set apart for thee a chamber where thou mayst seclude thee for thy devotions replied the old woman allah give him long life and continue his favour to you both but i would have you charge the doorkeeper not to stay my coming in to you and inshallah i will go the round of the holy places and pray for you two at the end of my devotions every day and night then she went out whilst naomi wept for parting with her knowing not the cause of her coming and returned to alhajjaj who said to her as thou do my bidding soon thou shalt have of me abundant good quoth she i ask of thee a full month and quoth he take the month thereupon the old hag fell to daily visiting niamahs house and frequented his slavewife naomi— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old hag fell to visiting daily niamahs house and frequenting his slave wife naomi and both ceased not to honour her and she used to go in to them morning and evening and all in the house respected her till one day being alone with naomi she said to her o my lady by allah when i go to the holy places i will pray for thee and i only wish thou wert with me that thou mightest look on the elders of the faith who resort thither and they should pray for thee according to thy desire naomi cried i conjure thee by allah take me with thee and she replied ask leave of thy mother in law and i will take thee so naomi said to her husbands mother o my lady ask my master to let us go forth me and thee one day with this my old mother to prayer and worship with the fakirs in the holy places now when niamah came in and sat down the old woman went up to him and would have kissed his hand but he forbade her so she invoked blessingsfn9 on him and left the house next day she came again in the absence of niamah and she addressed naomi saying we prayed for thee yesterday but arise now and divert thyself and return ere thy lord come home so naomi said to her motherinlaw i beseech thee for allahs sake give me leave to go with this pious woman that i may sight the saints of allah in the holy places and return speedily ere my lord come back quoth niamahs mother i fear lest thy lord know but said the old woman by allah i will not let her take seat on the floor no she shall look standing on her feet and not tarry so she took the damsel by guile and carrying her to alhajjajs palace told him of her coming after placing her in a lonely chamber whereupon he went in to her and looking upon her saw her to be the loveliest of the people of the day never had he beheld her like now when naomi caught sight of him she veiled her face from him but he left her not till he had called his chamberlain whom he commanded to take fifty horsemen and he bade him mount the damsel on a swift dromedary and bear her to damascus and there deliver her to the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwan moreover he gave him a letter for the caliph saying bear him this letter and bring me his answer and hasten thy return to me so the chamberlain without losing time took the damsel and she tearful for separation from her lord and setting out with her on a dromedary gave not over journeying till he reached damascus there he sought audience of the commander of the faithful and when it was granted the chamberlain delivered the damsel and reported the circumstance the caliph appointed her a separate apartment and going into his harim said to his wife al hajjaj hath bought me a slavegirl of the daughters of the kings of cufafn10 for ten thousand dinars and hath sent me this letter— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the two hundred and fortieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the caliph acquainted his wife with the story of the slavegirl she said to him allah increase to thee his favour then the caliphs sister went in to the supposed slavegirl and when she saw her she said by allah not unlucky is the man who hath thee in his house were thy cost an hundred thousand dinars and naomi replied o fair of face what kings palace is this and what is the city she answered this is the city of damascus and this is the palace of my brother the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwanfn11 then she resumed didst thou not know all this naomi said by allah o my lady i had no knowledge of it when the other asked and he who sold thee and took thy price did he not tell thee that the caliph had bought thee now when naomi heard these words she shed tears and said to herself verily i have been tricked and the trick hath succeeded adding to herself if i speak none will credit me so i will hold my peace and take patience for i know that the relief of allah is near then she bent her head for shame and indeed her cheeks were tanned by the journey and the sun so the caliphs sister left her that day and returned to her on the morrow with clothes and necklaces of jewels and dressed her after which the caliph came in to her and sat down by her side and his sister said to him look on this handmaid in whom allah hath conjoined every perfection of beauty and loveliness so he said to naomi draw back the veil from thy face but she would not unveil and he beheld not her face however he saw her wrists and love of her entered his heart and he said to his sister i will not go in unto her for three days till she be cheered by thy converse then he arose and left her but naomi ceased not to brood over her case and sigh for her separation from her master niamah till she fell sick of a fever during the night and ate not nor drank and her favour faded and her charms were changed they told the caliph of this and her condition grieved him so he visited her with physicians and men of skill but none could come at a cure for her this is how it fared with her but as regards niamah when he returned home he sat down on his bed and cried ho naomi but she answered not so he rose in haste and called out yet none came to him as all the women in the house had hidden themselves for fear of him then he went out to his mother whom he found sitting with her cheek on her hand and said to her o my mother where is naomi she answered o my son she is with one who is worthier than i to be trusted with her namely the devout old woman she went forth with her to visit devotionally the fakirs and return quoth niamah since when hath this been her habit and at what hour went she forth quoth his mother she went out early in the morning he asked and how camest thou to give her leave for this and she answered o my son twas she persuaded me there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed niamah and going forth from his home in a state of distraction he repaired to the captain of the watch to whom said he doss thou play tricks upon me and stealmy slavegirl away from my house i will assuredly complain of thee to the commander of the faithful said the chief of police who hath taken her and niamah replied an old woman of such and such a mien clad in woollen raiment and carrying a rosary of beads numbered by thousands rejoined the other find me the old woman and i will get thee back thy slavegirl and who knows the old woman retorted niamah and who knows the hidden things save allah may he be extolled and exalted cried the chief who knew her for alhajjajs procuress cried niamah i look to thee for my slavegirl and alhajjaj shall judge between thee and me and the master of police answered go to whom thou wilt so niamah went to the palace of alhajjaj for his father was one of the chief men of cufa and when he arrived there the chamberlain went in to the governor and told him the case whereupon alhajjaj said hither with him and when he stood before him enquired what be thy business said niamah such and such things have befallen me and the governor said bring me the chief of police and we will commend him to seek for the old woman now he knew that the chief of police was acquainted with her so when he came he said to him i wish thee to make search for the slavegirl of niamah son of alrabia and he answered none knoweth the hidden things save almighty allah rejoined alhajjaj there is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look for the damsel in all the roads and seek for her in the towns—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that alhajjaj said to the captain of the watch there is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look for the damsel on all the roads and seek for her in the towns then he turned to niamah and said to him and thy slavegirl return not i will give thee ten slavegirls from my house and ten from that of the chief of police and he again bade the captain of the watch go and seek for the girl so he went out and niamah returned home full of trouble and despairing of life for he had now reached the age of fourteen and there was yet no hair on his side cheeks so he wept and lamented and shut himself up from his household and ceased not to weep and lament he and his mother till the morning when his father came in to him and said o my son of a truth alhajjaj hath put a cheat upon the damsel and hath taken her but from hour to hour allah giveth relief however grief redoubled on niamah so that he knew not what he said nor knew he who came in to him and he fell sick for three months his charms were changed his father despaired of him and the physicians visited him and said there is no remedy for him save the damsel now as his father was sitting one day behold he heard tell of a skillful persian physician whom the folk gave out for perfect in medicine and astrology and geomancy so alrabia sent for him and seating him by his side entreated him with honour and said to him look into my sons case thereupon quoth he to niamah give me thy hand the young man gave him his hand and he felt his pulse and his joints and looked in his face then he laughed and turning to his father said thy sons sole ailment is one of the heartfn12 he replied thou sayest sooth o sage but apply thy skill to his state and case and acquaint me with the whole thereof and hide naught from me of his condition quoth the persian of a truth he is enamoured of a slavegirl and this slavegirl is either in bassorah or damascus and there is no remedy for him but reunion with her said alrabia an thou bring them together thou shalt live all thy life in wealth and delight answered the persian in good sooth this be an easy matter and soon brought about and he turned to niamah and said to him no hurt shall befall thee so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear then quoth he to alrabia bring me out four thousand dinars of your money so he gave them to him and he added i wish to carry thy son with me to damascus and almighty allah willing i will not return thence but with the damsel then he turned to the youth and asked what is thy name and he answered niamah quoth the persian o niamah sit up and be of good heart for allah will reunite thee with the damsel and when he sat up the leach continued be of good cheer for we set out for damascus this very day put thy trust in the lord and eat and drink and be cheerful so as to fortify thyself for travel upon this the persian began making preparation of all things needed such as presents and rarities and he took of alrabia in all the sum of ten thousand dinars together with horses and camels and beasts of burden and other requisites then niamah farewelled his father and mother and journeyed with the physician to aleppo they could find no news of naomi there so they fared on to damascus where they abode three days after which the persian took a shop and he adorned even the shelves with vessels of costly porcelain with covers of silver and with gildings and stuffs of price moreover he set before himself vases and flagons of glass full of all manner of ointments and ups and he surrounded them with cups of crystal—and placing astrolabe and geomantic tablet facing him he donned a physicians habit and took his seat in the shop then he set niamah standing before him clad in a shirt and gown of silk and girding his middle with a silken kerchief goldembroidered said to him o niamah henceforth thou art my son so call me naught but sire and i will call thee naught but son and he replied i hear and i obey thereupon the people of damascus flocked to the persians shop that they might gaze on the youths goodliness and the beauty of the shop and its contents whilst the physician spoke to niamah in persian and he answered him in the same tongue for he knew the language after the wont of the sons of the notables so that persian doctor soon became known among the townsfolk and they began to acquaint him with their ailments and he to prescribe for them remedies moreover they brought him the water of the sick in phialsfn13 and he would test it and say he whose water this is is suffering from such and such a disease and the patient would declare verily this physician sayeth sooth so he continued to do the occasions of the folk and they to flock to him till his fame spread throughout the city and into the houses of the great now one day as he sat in hisshop behold there came up an old woman riding on an ass with a stuffed saddle of brocade embroidered with jewels and stopping before the persians shop drew rein and beckoned him saying take my hand he took her hand and she alighted and asked him art thou the persian physician from irak yes answered he and she said know that i have a sick daughter then she brought out to him a phial—and the persian looked at it and said to her o my mistress tell me thy daughters name that i may calculate her horoscope and learn the hour in which it will befit her to drink medicine she replied o my brother the persianfn14 her name is naomi— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the persian heard the name of naomi he fell to calculating and writing on his hand and presently said o my lady i cannot prescribe a medicine for her till i know what country woman she is because of the difference of climate so tell me in what land she was brought up and what is her age the old woman replied she is fourteen years old and she was brought up in cufa of irak he asked and how long hath she sojourned in this country but a few months answered she now when niamah heard the old womans words and recognised the name of his slave girl his heart fluttered and he was like to faint then said the persian such and such medicines will suit her case and the old woman rejoined then make them up and give me what thou hast mentioned with the blessing of almighty allah so saying she threw upon the shop board ten gold pieces and he looked at niamah and bade him prepare the necessary drugs whereupon she also looked at the youth and exclaimed allah have thee in his keeping o my son verily she favoureth thee in age and mien then said she to the physician o my brother the persian is this thy slave or thy son he is my son answered he so niamah put up the medicine and placing it in a little box took a piece of paper and wrote thereon these two coupletsfn15

if naomi bless me with a single glance  let suadá sue and
             juml joy to
they said forget her twenty such thoult find  but none is
             like her—i will not forget

he pressed the paper into the box and sealing it up wrote upon the cover the following words in cufic characters i am niamah of alrabia of cufa then he set it before the old woman who took it and bade them farewell and returned to the caliphs palace and when she went up with the drugs to the damsel she placed the little box of medicine at her feet saying o my lady know that there is lately come to our town a persian physician than whom i never saw a more skilful nor a better versed in matters of malady i told him thy name after showing him the waterbottle and forthwith he knew thine ailment and prescribed a remedy then he bade his son make thee up this medicine and there is not in damascus a comelier or a seemlier youth than this lad of his nor hath anyone a shop the like of his shop so naomi took the box and seeing the names of her lord and his father written on the cover changed colour and said to herself doubtless the owner of this shop is come in search of me so she said to the old woman describe to me this youth answered the old woman his name is niamah he hath a mole on his right eyebrow is richly clad and is perfectly handsome cried naomi give me the medicine whereon be the blessing and help of almighty allah so she drank off the potion and she laughing and said indeed it is a blessed medicine then she sought in the box and finding the paper opened it read it understood it and knew that this was indeed her lord whereas her heart was solaced and she rejoiced now when the old woman saw her laughing she exclaimed this is indeed a blessed day and naomi said o nurse i have a mind for something to eat and drink the old woman said to the serving women bring a tray of dainty viands for your mistress whereupon they set food before her and she sat down to eat and behold in came the caliph who seeing her sitting at meat rejoiced and the old woman said to him o commander of the faithful i give thee joy of thy hand maid naomis recovery and the cause is that there is lately come to this our city a physician than whom i never saw a better versed in diseases and their remedies i fetched her medicine from him and she hath drunken of it but once and is restored to health quoth he take a thousand dinars and apply thyself to her treatment till she be completely recovered and he went away rejoicing in the damsels recovery whilst the old woman betook herself to the persians house and delivered the thousand dinars giving him to know that she was become the caliphs slave and also handing him a letter which naomi had written he took it and gave the letter to niamah who at first sight knew her hand and fell down in a swoon when he revived he opened the letter and found these words written therein from the slave despoiled of her niamah her delight her whose reason hath been beguiled and who is parted from the core of her heart but afterwards of a truth thy letter hath reached me and hath broadened my breast and solaced my soul even as saith the poet

thy note came long lost hungers wrote that note  till drop
             they sweetest scents for what they wrote
twas moses to his mothers arms restored  twas jacobs eye
             sight cured by josephs coatfn16

when niamah read these verses his eyes ran over with tears and the old woman said to him what maketh thee to weep o my son allah never cause thine eye to shed tears cried the persian o my lady how should my son not weep seeing that this is his slavegirl and he her lord niamah son of alrabia of cufa and her health dependeth on her seeing him for naught aileth her but loving him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
when it was the two hundred and fortythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian cried out to the old woman how shall my son not weep seeing that this is his slavegirl and he her lord niamah son of alrabia of cufa and the health of this damsel dependeth on her seeing him and naught aileth her but loving him so do thou o my lady take these thousand dinars to thyself and thou shalt have of me yet more than this only look on us with eyes of rush for we know not how to bring this affair to a happy end save through thee then she said to niamah say art thou indeed her lord he replied yes and she rejoined thou sayest sooth for she ceaseth not continually to name thee then he told her all that had passed from first to last and she said o youth thou shalt owe thy reunion with her to none but myself so she mounted and at once returning to naomi looked in her face and laughed saying it is just o my daughter that thou weep and fall sick for thy separation from thy master niamah son of alrabia of cufa quoth naomi verily the veil hath been withdrawn for thee and the truth revealed to thee rejoined the old woman be of good cheer and take heart for i will assuredly bring you together though it cost me my life then she returned to niamah and said to him i went to thy slave girl and conversed with her and i find that she longeth for thee yet more than thou for her for although the commander of the faithful is minded to become intimate with her she refuseth herself to him but if thou be stout of purpose and firm of heart i will bring you together and venture my life for you and play some trick and make shift to carry thee into the caliphs palace where thou shalt meet her for she cannot come forth and niamah answered allah requite thee with good then she took leave of him and went back to naomi and said thy lord is indeed dying of love for thee and would fain see thee and foregather with thee what sayest thou naomi replied and i too am longing for his sight and dying for his love whereupon the old woman took a parcel of womens clothes and ornaments and repairing to niamah said to him come with me into some place apart so he brought her into the room behind the shop where she stained his hands and decked his wrists and plaited his hair after which she clad him in a slavegirls habit and adorned him after the fairest fashion of womans adornment till he was as one of the houris of the garden of heaven and when she saw him thus she exclaimed blessed be allah best of creators by allah thou art handsomer than the damselfn17 now walk with thy left shoulder forwards and thy right well behind and sway thy hips from side to sidefn18 so he walked before her as she bade him and when she saw he had caught the trick of womans gait she said to him expect me tomorrow night and allah willing i will take and carry thee to the palace but when thou seest the chamberlains and the eunuchs be bold and bow thy head and speak not with any for i will prevent their speech and with allah is success accordingly when the morning dawned she returned and carrying him to the palace entered before him and he after her step by step the chamberlain would have stopped his entering but the old woman said to him o most ill omened of slaves this is the handmaid of naomi the caliphs favourite how durst thou stay her when she would enter then said she come in o damsel and the old woman went in and they ceased not faring on till they drew near the door leading to the inner piazza of the palace when she said to him o niamah hearten thyself and take courage and enter and turn to the left then count five doors and pass through the sixth for it is that of the place prepared for thee fear nothing and if any speak to thee answer not neither stop then she went up with him to the door and the chamberlain there on guard accosted her saying what damsel is this—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


when it was the two hundred and fortyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the chamberlain accosted the old woman saying what damsel is this quoth the ancient dame our lady hath a mind to buy her and he rejoined none may enter save by leave of the commander of the faithful so do thou go back with her i can not let her pass for thus am i commanded replied the old woman o chief chamberlain use thy reason thou knowest that naomi the caliphs slavegirl of whom he is enamoured is but now restored to health and the commander of the faithful hardly yet crediteth her recovery she is minded to buy this hand maid so oppose thou not her entrance lest haply it come to naomis knowledge and she be wroth with thee and suffer a relapse and this cause thy head to be cut off then said she to niamah enter o damsel pay no heed to what he saith and tell not the queenconsort that her chamberlain opposed thine entrance so niamah bowed his head and entered the palace and would have turned to the left but mistook the direction and walked to his right and meaning to count five doors and enter the sixth he counted six and entering the seventh found himself in a place whose floor was carpeted with brocade and whose walls were hung with curtains of gold embroidered silk and therein stood censers of aloeswood and ambergris and strongscented musk and at the upper end was a couch bespread with cloth of gold on which he seated himself marvelling at the magnificence he saw and knowing not what was written for him in the secret purpose as he sat musing on his case the caliphs sister followed by her handmaid came in upon him and seeing the youth seated there took him for a slavegirl and accosted him and said who art thou o damsel and what is thy case and who brought thee hither he made no reply and was silent when she continued o damsel if thou be one of my brothers concubines and he be wroth with thee i will intercede with him for thee and get thee grace but he answered her not a word so she said to her slavegirl stand at the door and let none enter then she went up to niamah and looking at him was amazed at his beauty and said to him o lady tell me who thou art and what is thy name and how thou camest here for i have never seen thee in our palace still he answered not whereat she was angered and putting her hand to his bosom found no breasts and would have unveiled him that she might know who he was but he said to her o my lady i am thy slave and i cast myself on thy protection do thou protect me she said no harm shall come to thee but tell me who thou art and who brought thee into this my apartment answered he o princess i am known as niamah bin alrabia of cufa and i have ventured my life for the sake of my slavegirl naomi whom alhajjaj took by sleight and sent hither said she fear not no harm shall befall thee then calling her maid she said to her go to naomis chamber and send her to me meanwhile the old woman went to naomis bedroom and said to her hath thy lord come to thee no by allah answered naomi and the other said belike he hath gone astray and entered some chamber other than thine and lost himself so naomi cried there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great our last hour is come and we are all lost and while they were sitting and sadly enough pondering their case in came the princesss handmaid and saluting naomi said to her my lady biddeth thee to her banquet i hear and i obey answered the damsel and the old woman said belike thy lord is with the caliphs sister and the veil of secrecy hath been rent so naomi at once sprang up and betook herself to the princess who said to her here is thy lord sitting with me it seemeth he hath mistaken the place but please allah neither thou nor he has any cause for fear when naomi heard these words she took heart of grace and went up to niamah and her lord when he saw her—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when niamah saw his handmaid naomi he rose to meet her and strained her to his bosom and both fell to the ground fainting as soon as they came to themselves the caliphs sister said to them sit ye down and take we counsel for your deliverance from this your strait and they answered o our lady we hear and obey it is thine to command quoth she by allah no harm shall befall you from us then she bade her handmaids bring meat and drink which was done and they sat down and ate till they had enough after which they sat drinking then the cup went round amongst them and their cares ceased from them but niamah said would i knew how this will end the princess asked o niamah dost thou love thy slave naomi and he answered of a truth it is my passion for her which hath brought me to this state of peril for my life then said she to the damsel o naomi dost thou love thy lord niamah and she replied o my lady it is the love of him which hath wasted my body and brought me to evil case rejoined the princess by allah since ye love each other thus may he not be who would part you be of good cheer and keep your eyes cool and clear at this they both rejoiced and naomi called for a lute and when they brought it she took it and tuned it and played a lively measure which enchanted the hearers and after the prelude sang these couplets

when the slanderers cared but to part us twain  we owed no
            blooddebt could raise their ire
and they poured in our ears all the din of war  and aid failed
             and friends when my want was dire
i fought them hard with mine eyes and tears  with breath and
             sword with the stream and fire

then naomi gave the lute to her master niamah saying sing thou to us some verse so he took it and playing a lively measure intoned these couplets

full moon if unfreckled would favour thee  and sun uneclipsed
             would reflect thy blee
i wonder but love is of wonders full  and ardour and passion
             and ecstasy
how short the way to my love i fare  which from her faring so
             long i see
now when he had made an end of his song naomi filled the cup and gave it to him and he took it and drank it off then she filled again and gave the cup to the caliphs sister who also emptied it after which the princess in her turn took the lute and tightened the strings and tuned it and sang these two couplets

grief cark and care in my heart reside  and the fires of love
             in my breast
my wasted form to all eyes shows clear  for desire my body hath
             mortified

then she filled the cup and gave it to naomi who drank it off and taking the lute sang these two couplets

o to whom i gave soul which thou tortures  and in vain id
             recover from fair unfaith
do grant thy favours my care to cure  ere i die for this be my
             latest breath

and they ceased not to sing verses and drink to the sweet sound of the strings full of mirth and merriment and joy and jollity till behold in came the commander of the faithful now when they saw him they rose and kissed the ground before him and he seeing naomi with the lute in her hand said to her o naomi praised be allah who hath done away from thee sickness and suffering then he looked at niamah who was still disguised as a woman and said to the princess o my sister what damsel is this by naomis side she replied o commander of the faithful thou hast here a handmaid one of thy concubines and the bosom friend of naomi who will neither eat nor drink without her and she repeated the words of the poet

two contraries and both concur in opposite charms  and charms so contraried by contrast lovelier show

quoth the caliph by allah omnipotent verily she is as handsome as naomi and tomorrow i will appoint her a separate chamber beside that of her friend and send her furniture and stuffs and all that befitteth her in honour of naomi then the princess called for food and set it before her brother who ate and made himself at home in their place and company then filling a cup he signed to naomi to sing so she took the lute after draining two of them and sang these two couplets

since my toperfriend in my hand hath given  three cups that
             brim and bubble eer since
ive trailed my skirts throughout night for pride  as tho
             prince of the faithful i were thy prince

the prince of true believers was delighted and filling another cup gave it to naomi and bade her sing again so after draining the cup and sweeping the strings she sang as follows—

o most noble of men in this time and stound  of whom none may
             boast he is equalfound
o matchless in greatness of soul and gifts  o thou chief o
             thou king amongst all renowned
lord who dealest large boons to the lords of earth  whom thou
             vexest not nor dost hold them bound
the lord preserve thee and spoil thy foes  and neer cease thy
            lot with good fortune crowned

now when the caliph heard these couplets he exclaimed by allah good by allah excellent verily the lord hath been copiousfn19 to thee o naomi how clever is thy tongue and how dear is thy speech and they ceased not their mirth and good cheer till midnight when the caliphs sister said to him give ear o commander of the faithful to a tale i have read in books of a certain man of rank and what is this tale quoth he quoth she know o prince of the faithful that there lived once in the city of cufa a youth called niamah son of alrabia and he had a slavegirl whom he loved and who loved him they had been reared in one bed but when they grew up and mutuallove get hold of them fortune smote them with her calamities and time the tyrant brought upon them his adversity and decreed separation unto them thereupon designing and slanderous folk enticed her by sleight forth of his house and stealing her away from his home sold her to one of the kings for ten thousand dinars now the girl loved her lord even as he loved her so he left kith and kin and house and home and the gifts of fortune and set out to search for her and when she was found he devised means to gain access to her—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the caliphs sister said and niamah ceased not absenting himself from his kith and kin and patrialstead that he might gain access to his handmaid and he incurred every peril and lavished his life till he gained access to her and her name was naomi like this slavegirl but the interview was short they had not been long in company when in came the king who had bought her of her kidnapper and hastily ordered them to be slain without doing justice by his own soul and delaying to enquire into the matter before the command was carried out now what sayest thou o commander of the faithful of this kings wrongous conduct answered the caliph this was indeed a strange thing it behoved that king to pardon when he had the power to punish and he ought to have regarded three things in their favour the first was that they loved each other the second that they were in his house and in his grasp and the third that it befitteth a king to be deliberate in judging and ordering between folk and how much more so in cases where he himself is concerned wherefore this king thus did an unkingly deed then said his sister o my brother by the king of the heavens and the earth i conjure thee bid naomi sing and hearken to that she shall sing so he said o naomi sing to me whereupon she played a lively measure and sang these couplets

beguiled us fortune who her guile displays  smiting the heart
             bequeathing thoughts that craze
and parting lovers whom she made to meet  till tears in torrent
             either cheek displays
they were and i was and my life was glad  while fortune often
             joyed to join our ways
i will pour tear flood will rain gouts of blood  thy loss
             bemoaning through the nights and days

now when the commander of the faithful heard this verse he was moved to great delight and his sister said to him o my brother whoso decideth in aught against himself him it behoveth to abide by it and do according to his word and thou hast judged against thyself by this judgement then said she o niamah stand up and do thou likewise up stand o naomi so they stood up and she continued o prince of true believers she who standeth before thee is naomi the stolen whom alhajjaj bin yusuf alsakafi kidnapped and sent to thee falsely pretending in his letter to thee that he had bought her for ten thousand gold pieces and this other who standeth before thee is her lord niamah son of alrabia and i beseech thee by the honour of thy pious forebears and by hamzah and ukayl and abbasfn20 to pardon them both and overlook their offence and bestow them one on the other that thou mayst win rich reward in the next world of thy just dealing with them for they are under thy hand and verily they have eaten of thy meat and drunken of thy drink and behold i make intercession for them and beg of thee the boon of their blood thereupon quoth the caliph thou speakest sooth i did indeed give judgement as thou sayst and i am not one to pass sentence and to revoke it then said he o naomi say be this thy lord and she answered even so o commander of the faithful then quoth he no harm shall befall you i give you each to other adding to the young man o niamah who told thee where she was and taught thee how to get at this place he replied o commander of the faithful hearken to my tale and give ear to my history for by the virtue of thy pious forefathers i will hide nothing from thee and he told him all that had passed between himself and the persian physician and the old nurse and how she had brought him into the palace and he had mistaken the doors whereat the caliph wondered with exceeding wonder and said fetch me the persian so they brought him into the presence and he was made one of his chief officers moreover the king bestowed on him robes of honour and ordered him a handsome present saying when a man hath shown like this man such artful management it behoveth us to make him one of our chief officers the caliph also loaded niamah and naomi with gifts and honours and rewarded the old nurse and they abode with him seven days in joy and content and all delight of life when niamah craved leave to return to cufa with his slavegirl the caliph gave them permission and they departed and arrived in due course at cufa where niamah was restored to his father and mother and they abode in all the joys and jollities of life till there came to them the destroyer of delights and the sunderer of societies now when amjad and asad heard from bahram this story they marvelled with extreme marvel and said by allah this is indeed a rare tale—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when amjad and asad heard this story from bahram the magian who had become a moslem they marvelled with extreme marvel and thus passed that night and when the next morning dawned they mounted and riding to the palace sought an audience of the king who granted it and received them with high honour now as they were sitting together talking of a sudden they heard the towns folk crying aloud and shouting to one another and calling for help and the chamberlain came in to the king and said to him some king hath encamped before the city he and his host with arms and weapons displayed and we know not their object and aim the king took counsel with his wazir amjad and his brother asad and amjad said i will go out to him and learn the cause of his coming so he took horse and riding forth from the city repaired to the strangers camp where he found the king and with him a mighty many and mounted mamelukes when the guards saw him they knew him for an envoy from the king of the city so they took him and brought him before their sultan then amjad kissed the ground before him but lo the king was a queen who was veiled with a mouthveil and she said to amjad know that i have no design on this your city and that i am come hither only in quest of a beardless slave of mine whom if i find with you i will do you no harm but if i find him not then shall there befall sore onslaught between me and you asked amjad o queen what like is thy slave and what is his story and what may be his name said she his name is asad and my name is marjanah and this slave came to my town in company of bahram a magian who refused to sell him to me so i took him by force but his master fell upon him by night and bore him away by stealth and he is of such and such a favour when amjad heard that he knew it was indeed his brother asad whom she sought and said to her o queen of the age alhamdolillah praised be allah who hath brought us relief verily this slave whom thou seekest is my brother then he told her their story and all that had befallen them in the land of exile and acquainted her with the cause of their departure from the islands of ebony whereat she marvelled and rejoiced to have found asad so she bestowed a dress of honour upon amjad and he returned forthright to the king and told him what had passed at which they all rejoiced and the king went forth with amjad and asad to meet queen marjanah when they were admitted to her presence and sat down to converse with her and were thus pleasantly engaged behold a dust cloud rose and flew and grew till it walled the view and after a while it lifted and showed beneath it an army dight for victory in numbers like the swelling sea armed and armoured capàpie who making for the city encompassed it around as the ring encompasseth the little fingerfn21 and a bared brand was in every hand when amjad and asad saw this they exclaimed verily to allah we belong and to him we shall return what is this mighty host doubtless these are enemies and except we agree with this queen marjanah to fight them they will take the town from us and slay us there is no resource for us but to go out to them and see who they are so amjad arose and took horse and passed through the city gate to queen marjanahs camp but when he reached the approaching army he found it to be that of his grand sire king ghayur father of his mother queen budur—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when amjad reached the approaching host he found it to be that of his grandsire lord of the isles and the seas and the seven castles and when he went into the presence he kissed the ground between his hands and delivered to him the message quoth the king my name is king ghayur and i come wayfaring in quest of my daughter budur whom fortune hath taken from me for she left me and returned not to me nor have i heard any tidings of her or of her husband kamar alzaman have ye any news of them when amjad heard this he hung his head towards the ground for a while in thought till he felt assured that this king was none other than his grandfather his mothers father where upon he raised his head and kissing ground before him told him that he was the son of his daughter budur on hearing which ghayur threw himself upon him and they both fell a weepingfn22 then said ghayur praised be allah o my son for safety since i have foregathered with thee and amjad told him that his daughter budur was safe and sound and her husband kamar alzaman likewise and acquainted him that both abode in a city called the city of ebony moreover he related to him how his father being wroth with him and his brother had commended that both be put to death but that his treasurer had taken pity on them and let them go with their lives quoth king ghayur i will go back with thee and thy brother to your father and make your peace with him so amjad kissed the ground before him in huge delight and the king bestowed a dress of honour upon him after which he returned smiling to the king of the city of the magians and told him what he had learnt from king ghayur whereat he wondered with exceeding wonder then he despatched guestgifts of sheep and horses and camels and forage and so forth to king ghayur and did the like by queen marjanah and both of them told her what chanced whereupon quoth she i too will accompany you with my troops and will do my endeavour to make this peace meanwhile behold there arose another dust cloud and flew and grew till it walled the view and blackened the days bright hue and under it they heard shouts and cries and neighing of steeds and beheld sword glance and the glint of levelled lance when this new host drew near the city and saw the two other armies they beat their drums and the king of the magians exclaimed this is indeed naught but a blessed day praised be allah who hath made us of accord with these two armies and if it be his will he shall give us peace with yon other as well then said he to amjad and asad fare forth and fetch us news of these troops for they are a mighty host never saw i a mightier so they opened the city gates which the king had shut for fear of the beleaguering armies and amjad and asad went forth and coming to the new host found that it was indeed a mighty many but as soon as they came to it behold they knew that it was the army of the king of the ebony islands wherein was their father king kamar alzaman in person now when they looked upon him they kissed ground and wept but when he beheld them he threw himself upon them weeping with sore weeping and strained them to his breast for a full hour then he excused himself to them and told them what desolation he had suffered for their loss and exile and they acquainted him with king ghayurs arrival whereupon he mounted with his chief officers and taking with him his two sons proceeded to that kings camp as they drew near one of the princes rode forward and informed king ghayur of kamar alzamans coming whereupon he came out to meet him and they joined company marvelling at these things and how they had chanced to foregather in that place then the townsfolk made them banquets of all manner of meats and sweetmeats and presented to them horses and camels and fodder and other guestgifts and all that the troops needed and while this was doing behold yet another cloud of dust arose and flew till it walled the view whilst earth trembled with the tramp of steed and tabors sounded like stormy winds after a while the dust lifted and discovered an army clad in coats of mail and armed capàpie but all were in black garb and in their midst rode a very old man whose beard flowed down over his breast and he also was clad in black when the king of the city and the city folk saw this great host he said to the other kings praised be allah by whose omnipotent command ye are met here all in one day and have proved all known one to the other but what vast and victorious army is this which hemmeth in the whole land like a wall they answered have no fear of them we are three kings each with a great army and if they be enemies we will join thee in doing battle with them were they three times as many as they now are meanwhile up came an envoy from the approaching host making for the city so they brought him before kamar alzaman king ghayur queen marjanah and the king of the city and he kissed the ground and said my liege lord cometh from persialand for many years ago he lost his son and he is seeking him in all countries if he find him with you well and good but if he find him not there will be war between him and you and he will waste your city rejoined kamar alzaman it shall not come to that but how is thy master called in ajam land answered the envoy he is called king shahriman lord of the khálidan islands and he hath levied these troops in the lands traversed by him whilst seeking his son novv when kamar alzaman heard these words he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which lasted a long while and anon coming to himself he wept bitter tears and said to amjad and asad go ye o my sons with the herald salute your grandfather and my father king shahriman and give him glad tidings of me for he mourneth my loss and even to the present time he weareth black raiment for my sake then he told the other kings all that had befallen him in the days of his youth at which they wondered and going down with him from the city repaired to his father whom he saluted and they embraced and fell to the ground senseless for excess of joy and when they revived after a while kamar alzaman acquainted his father with all his adventures and the other kings saluted shahriman then after having married marjanah to asad they sent her back to her kingdom charging her not to cease correspondence with them so she took leave and went her way moreover they married amjad to bostan bahrams daughter and they all set out for the city of ebony and when they arrived there kamar alzaman went in to his fatherinlaw king armanus and told him all that had befallen him and how he had found his sons whereat armanus rejoiced and gave him joy of his safe return then king ghayur went in to his daughter queen budurfn23 and saluted her and quenched his longing for her company and they all abode a full months space in the city of ebony after which the king and his daughter returned to their own country—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fortyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king ghayur set out with his daughter and his host for his own land and they took with them amjad and returned home by easy marches and when ghayur was settled again in his kingdom he made his grandson king in his stead and as to kamar alzaman he also made asad king in his room over the capital of the ebony islands with the consent of his grandfather king armanus and set out himself with his father king shahriman till the two made the islands of khálidan then the lieges decorated the city in their honour and they ceased not to beat the drums for glad tidings a whole month nor did kamar alzaman leave to govern in his fathers place till there overtook them the destroyer of delights and the sunderer of societies and allah knoweth all things quoth king shahryar o shahrazad this is indeed a most wonderful tale and she answered o king it is not more wonderful than that of
