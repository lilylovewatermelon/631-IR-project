yo
im sick of this man
i cant even take no more
cause i hate the fact that i love you so much
and you know what im saying
you dont even understand what this is doing to me
every time i try to get away i just cant let you go
you know what im saying
i just cant let you go

verse 1 usher  jermaine dupri
i never ever wanna hurt you i just wanna love ya
i just wanna sex you up
i wanna give you everything you need thing you want
just lay down and let me love you all night long
it was beautiful when we first started
i dont wanna leave you i just wanna keep you
when they saw me they saw you
damn the world its just me and my girl
thats how i felt
every time i thought it was right it went left

chorus usher  jermaine dupri
we used to laugh and party
now all we do is argue what happened to all the good times
i tell myself that i dont want you no more girl
but i cant let you go you see i cant let you go
so much love and hurt and hate i hate this
people screaming it wont work
time and time i say im gonna leave see what im saying
but i cant let you go

chorus usher

verse 3 jermaine dupri
got me walking around ready to snap
got me walking around looking for somebody to slap
got me going going with no pause
got me up in cartier everyday just cause
got me arguing about little stuff she dont call little stuff
it get a little rough then we kiss and make up
she wanna say what she wanna i dont play that
she wanna constantly bring up shit from way back
got me thinking about her while im watching a flick
got me dipping through traffic trying to get home quick
got me talking to myself im hating this
got me wanting to wild out like im jadakiss
got me in a place i never thought i would see
got me not wanting to stay not wanting to leave
got me happy got me confused
got me wishing i could get it how i used to

chorus usher
we used to laugh and party
now all we do is argue
i tell myself that i dont want you no more
but i cant let you go
so much love and hurt and hate
people screaming it wont work
time and time i say im gonna leave
but i cant let you go
we used to laugh and party
now all we do is argue
i tell myself that i dont want you no more
but i cant let you go
so much love and hurt and hate
people screaming it wont work
time and time i say im gonna leave
but i cant let you go1embed"
