now maybe the world doesnt see you
and maybe they dont understand
just cause you dont see the footprints
dont mean that theyre not in the sand
i know youre surrounded by strangers
it feels so alone in your heart
but when everyone stands in the darkness
no one can tell them apart

prechorus
now everyone has their own story
and nobodys ends quite the same
i live for the days in the sunshine
apart from the nights in the rain

chorus
but love brings change oh yes it does
love brings change change
love brings change
love brings change change
oh love brings change when you need it
love love love brings change

verse 2
when you look eye to eye with an angel
dont mean that its always the end
sometimes its the start of a new blessing
that comes in the form of a friend
now we all live in fear of when that day will come
when memories are all we can hold
the fire that burns is our natural love
and it keeps us both warm when its cold
