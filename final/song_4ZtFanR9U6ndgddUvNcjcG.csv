ah

verse 1
well good for you i guess you moved on really easily
you found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
world
and good for you i guess that youve been workin on yourself
i guess that therapist i found for you she really helped
now you can be a better man for your brandnew girl girl

chorus
well good for you
you look happy and healthy not me
if you ever cared to ask
good for you
youre doin great out there without me baby
god i wish that i could do that
ive lost my mind ive spent the night
cryin on the floor of my bathroom
but youre so unaffected i really dont get it
but i guess good for you

verse 2
well good for you i guess youre gettin everything you want ah
you bought a new car and your careers really takin off ah
its like we never even happened
baby what the fuck is up with that ah
and good for you its like you never even met me
remember when you swore to god i was the only
person who ever got you well screw that and screw you
you will never have to hurt the way you know that i do
