there are times that walk from you
like some passing afternoon
summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon
and she chose a yard to burn
but the ground remembers her
wooden spoons her children stir her bougainvillea blooms

chorus 1
there are things that drift away
like our endless numbered days
autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made
and shes chosen to believe
in the hymns her mother sings
sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves

verse 2
there are sailing ships that pass
all our bodies in the grass
springtime calls her children til she lets them go at last
and shes chosen where to be
though shes lost her wedding ring
somewhere near her misplaced jar of bougainvillea seeds

chorus 2
there are things we cant recall
blind as night that finds us all
winter tucks her children in her fragile china dolls
but my hands remember hers
rolling round the shaded ferns
naked arms her secrets still like songs id never learned

there are names across the sea
only now i do believe
sometimes with the windows closed shell sit and think of me
but shell mend his tattered clothes
and theyll kiss as if they know
a baby sleeps in all our bones so scared to be alone9embed"
