here a little sympathy for you to waste on me
i know youre faking it but thats okay
and i dont want to drag it out
dont want to bring you down
i never wanted it to end this way

chorus 1
even if i wanted to
i dont think that id get to you
theres nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again

verse 2
here a little jealousy
i hope you think of me
hope you wonder where i sleep at night sleep at night
cause i feel like im inside out
you got me upside down
maybe i was holding on too tight

chorus 2
even if i wanted to
i dont think that id get to you
theres nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again
so dont just say goodbye to me
just turn your back away and leave
and if youre lucky i will be your last regret your only friend

the two of us we dream like one
the two of us the two of us
the two of us take breath like one

verse 3
i guess that this is over now
i guess its called the falling out
but everyday im learning how to make it through this life im in

chorus 2
even if i wanted to
i dont think that id get to you
theres nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again
so dont just say goodbye to me
just turn your back away and leave
and if youre lucky i will be your last regret your only friendembed"
