crawl under me
shes just a damn hard to please
im begging dont dont believe
i swear that im not leaving
she never sleeps
so push me down on my knees
shes got some cards up her sleeve
girl i can barely breathe in

i think ive done it again
why dont you

an endless falling from grace falling from grace

burden of beast
shes not at all what she seems
a nightmare turned into dreams
the devil cant believe it

i think ive done it again
why dont you
