verse 1
chaos its just the beginning
every promise i made im rescinding
center mass in the middle of the monster
im getting tired of drowning the constant
cry for help its debatable
the only reason that you love me is im hated by all
come on come see dysfunction
i guess were gonna leave it open for discussion
who am i where am i going
maybe im looking in the wrong direction
maybe im looking for any direction

prechorus
this is not my war
this is not my fight
this is something more
this is not my life
this is not my revolution
this is not my convolution
this is not my expectation
this is not my desperation
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeverse 2
yeah holed up scarred and tamed for the hell of it
look at me i am the glorified malcontent
save me save this
all i gotta do is give up and all is forgiven
im sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke
and i dont get the punchline
a million people lined up for miles
to see the great big mouth shut up and apologize

prechorus
this is not my war
this is not my fight
this is something more
this is not my life
this is not my revolution
this is not my convolution
this is not my only reason to question why
today i said goodbye goodbye

chorus
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye
postchorus
yeah

bridge
im the pariah break me
i am the liar save me
i can take anything make me
accuse me of everything kill me
cut off the system enslave me
deny my existence waste me
i wont be afraid try me
i wont be unmade deny me
so come on break it off
come on buy the lie
come on say it say it
come on say goodbye

chorus
goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye
