back in the day it just went without saying at all
all the worlds history gradually dying of shock
there is this thing thats like talking except you dont talk
you sing
you sing

sing for the bartender sing for the janitor sing
sing for the cameras sing for the animals sing
sing for the children shooting the children sing
sing for the teachers who told you that you couldnt sing
just sing

there is this thing keeping everyones lungs and lips locked
it is called fear and its seeing a great renaissance
after the show you can not sing wherever you want
but for now lets all pretend that were gonna get bombed
so sing

sing cause its obvious sing for the astronauts sing
sing for the president sing for the terrorists sing
sing for the soccer team sing for the janjaweed sing
sing for the kid with the phone who refuses to sing
just sing

life is no cabaret
we dont care what you say
were inviting you anyway
you motherfuckers youll sing somedayyou might also like2embed"
