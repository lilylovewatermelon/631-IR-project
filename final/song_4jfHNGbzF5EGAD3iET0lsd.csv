sell me candy like the summer when its melting in my hands
i know youre around like the ice cream man
i can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
sweet like sugar tell me what i wanna hear

prechorus
im weak by your touch and when its melting on my lips
a rush through my body feel it in my fingertips
you selling me your fantasy that i wanna explore
sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core you know

chorus
talk to me
take care of my dreams
all i need is you beside me
it’s destiny just let it be
if the words can speak
then baby sell it to me

postchorus
sell me candy sell me love
sell me heaven sell me doves
so whats the charge whats the cost
im the daddy you the boss

i try to resist but every time i fail
the one temptation that i gotta endure
youre running through my body now youre knocking at my door

prechorus
forbidden little kiss and you call it bittersweet
but the shawty that youre rocking with aint nothing like me
you selling me your fantasy that i wanna explore
sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core you know

chorus
talk to me
take care of my dreams
all i need is you beside me
it’s destiny just let it be
if the words can speak
then baby sell it to me

sell me heaven sell me doves
so whats the charge whats the cost

verse 3
i want you babe more than you know
so dont you leave and dont you go

these arms wont hold you wrong
i want your love give you my trust
i wanna live for both of us
i wanna breathe ya lay on your shoulder
i wanna warm ya when nights get colder
i want love love love love love love
i want love love love love love love

chorus

its destiny just let it be
if the words can speak
then baby sell it to me
