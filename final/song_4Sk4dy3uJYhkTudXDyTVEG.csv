think back and talk to me
did i grow up according to plan

and do you think im wasting my time
doing things i wanna do
but it hurts when you disapprove all along

and now i try hard to make it
i just wanna make you proud
im never gonna be good enough for you

cant pretend that im all right
and you cant change me

cause we lost it all nothing lasts forever
im sorry i cant be perfect
now its just too late and we cant go back
im sorry i cant be perfect

i try not to think about the pain i feel inside
did you know you used to be my hero
all the days you spent with me now seem so far away
and it feels like you dont care anymore

and now i try hard to make it
i just wanna make you proud
im never gonna be good enough for you
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likei cant stand another fight
and nothings alright

cause we lost it all and nothing lasts forever
im sorry i cant be perfect
now its just too late and we cant go back
im sorry i cant be perfect

nothings gonna change the things that you said
and nothings gonna make this right again right again
please dont turn your back i
cant believe its hard just to talk to you
but you dont understand you dont understand

cause we lost it all and nothing lasts forever
im sorry i cant be perfect
now its just too late and we cant go back
im sorry i cant be perfect

cause we lost it all and nothing lasts forever
im sorry i cant be perfect
now its just too late and we cant go back
im sorry i cant be perfectembed"
