ive been drunk three times this week
spent all my money on a fleeting moment
i thought iiiiii can shake this off
now iiiiii cant make this stop
yeah things were sweet three months ago
when i was living how i wanna on my own
and i thought iiiiii dont need that much
i guess iiiiii was out of touch

chorus
im fucked up im faded
im so complicated
those things that i said
they were so overrated
but iiiiii yeah i meant it
oh yeah iiiiii really fucking meant it

yeah i meant it

verse 2
i gave up three times this week
went through those feelings
like i wasnt worth nothing
i thought iiiiii can shake this off
no iiiiii cant be this soft
