im just a man but i know that im damned
all the dead seem to know where i am
the tale that began on the night of my birth
will be done in a turn of the earth

chorus 1
lie where i land let my bones turn to sand
i was born on the lake and i dont want to leave it
every eye on the coast ever more
will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

verse 2
under the waves and the earth of an age
lie a thousand old northerners graves
deep in the night when the moons glowing bright
they come rising up into the night

chorus 2
die if i must let my bones turn to dust
im the lord of the lake and i dont want to leave it
all who sail off the coast ever more
will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore
