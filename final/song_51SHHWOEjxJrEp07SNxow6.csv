tell me whats wrong with society
when everywhere i look i see
young girls dying to be on tv
they wont stop till theyve reached their dreams
diet pills surgery
photoshopped pictures in magazines
telling them how they should be
it doesnt make sense to me

chorus
is everybody going crazy
is anybody gonna save me
can anybody tell me whats going on
tell me whats going on
if you open your eyes
youll see that something is wrong

verse 2
i guess things are not how they used to be
theres no more normal families
parents act like enemies
making kids feel like its world war iii
no one cares no ones there
i guess were all just too damn busy
and moneys our first priority
it doesnt make sense to me
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likechorus
is everybody going crazy
is anybody gonna save me
can anybody tell me whats going on
tell me whats going on
if you open your eyes
youll see that something is wrong

bridge
is everybody going crazy
is everybody going crazy

verse 3
tell me whats wrong with society
when everywhere i look i see
rich guys driving big suvs
while kids are starving in the streets
no one cares
no one likes to share
i guess lifes unfair

chorus
is everybody going crazy
is anybody gonna save me
can anybody tell me whats going on
tell me whats going on
if you open your eyes
youll see that something something is wrong
is everybody going crazy
can anybody tell me whats going on
tell me whats going on
if you open your eyes
youll see that something is wrong4embed"
