lord i cant take it no mo
one two three in the place to be
mf doom talib kweli ah here we go

verse 1 talib kweli
on born days i used to blow out the candles and every saturday
watch cartoons til noon and then id switch to ralph mcdaniels
i was makin up a miracle flow over a cereal bowl
and a pause beat from my stereo
rhymes stronger than popeye with the spinach out
im gangster like the frog on courageous cat and minute mouse
maybe im trippin and its just a cartoon to you
but i got chills when i heard how doom flipped the scooby doo
and i might be buggin but it seem to me
that cartoons be realer than reality tv
they inspire my decision to be open and listen
but folks got it all twisted like a yoga position
like in order to spit it dope you gotta have a criminal past
thats similar to the cast of different strokes
me and my people break bread sit and smoke
the conversation rich but that depend on what you consider broke
i draw on anything for inspiration
a fond memory a piece of paper walls in a train station

chorus talib kweli
its just that im old school like that
roll that rap over soul loops like that
its just that im old school like that
roll that rap over soul loops like that
im old school yall keep it goin yall its just that im old school like that
i keep it goin yall here we go well see roll that rap over soul loops like that
im old school yall keep it goin yall its just that im old school like that
keep it goin yall ah here we go cmon roll that rap over soul loops like that
yeah

and well be right back after these messages
fellas grab your nutsacks chicks squeeze your breastesses
we aint all that grown its still funny like
goin to the store on your own with rainbow money
since then had an insane flow sonny
walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain nose runny
breakdancin maybe ten bummy
is when subroc would run up handspring arabian somee
ooh wee like a hong kong phooey kick
or a weekend afternoon karate movie flick
slept good no justice no peace
woody kept it hoody never discussed it with police
shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat
or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat
and since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat
what type of chitlins is that
the super villain has the bad hydrotonic
whoever willin to ride provide raw chronic

chorus talib kweli
its just that im old school like that
roll that rap over soul loops like that
its just that im old school like that
roll that rap over soul loops like that
im old school yall keep it goin yall its just that im old school like that
i keep it goin yall here we go well see roll that rap over soul loops like that
im old school yall keep it goin yall its just that im old school like that
keep it goin yall ah here we go cmon roll that rap over soul loops like that
