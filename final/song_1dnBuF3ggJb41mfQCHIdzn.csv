verse 1
some say im paranoid i say im careful how i choose my friends
i been to icu once i aint going again
first z got murked then roy got murked
and homie still in the hood why he aint getting hurt
i smell somethin fishy man it might be a rat
damn niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
you know me i stay with a bitch on her knees
and give guns away in the hood like its government cheese
spray off suzukis eleven hundred ccs
no plate on the back straight squeezing the mac
in the hood they identify niggas by they cars
so i switch up whips to stay off the radar
i aint gotta be around to make shit hot
ill send yayo to dump thirty shots on your block
you should spray that tec nigga if i say get it done
ill make you wet niggas if you round me son
see 50 cent liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i gotta make it to heaven

i gotta make it to heaven i hope i make it to heaven
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i gotta make it to heaven
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i hope i make it to heaven

verse 2
when i come through the hood i dont stop to rap to niggas yeah
get close enough to smack ya then clap ya nigga
pop tried to front so i waved the chrome on his ass
pointblank range i spazzed pulled a bone on his ass woo
two weeks later niggas came through with macs to lay me down
they sprayed i played dead and got the fuck off the ground
out the blue i get a phone call 50 what up
they sent a bitch at me i sent the bitch back cut up
i dont play that pussy shit i done told you boy
front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
cousin twin shot up his mama crib now he in jail
tripping off flicks of blu cantrell pussy and black tail
pop mama moved but she dont talk to him no more
the shells from twins fourfour blew the hinge off her door
without that check every month how she gon pay for the crib
man social service finna come and take them kids
chorus
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i gotta make it to heaven
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i hope i make it to heaven
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i gotta make it to heaven
i gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
i gotta make it to heaven i hope i make it to heaven

verse 3
lord grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change
the courage to change the things i can the wisdom to know the difference yeah
in aa they make you say that
thats the prayer they burn in your head when you in casat woo
man i might talk to you while we up in them pens uhhuh
but when we come home that dont mean we gon fucking be friends
the shells pass your head close enough to hear em whistle
thank god they missed you and go grab your pistol
in the hood niggas running round acting crazy uhhuh
buying little air jordans for maybe babies
see it might be his and it might be yours
cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores haha
man it dont take much for you to get in them drawers uhhuh
you can have em on they back or on all fours
you aint got to tell me you feeling this shit
cause i hear what im saying i know im killing this shit
