verse 1
youll never make me stay so take your head off of me
i know your every move so wont you please let me be
ive been here times before but i was too blind to see
that you seduce every man this time you wont seduce me
shes saying thats okay hey baby do what you please
i am the stuff that you want i am the thing that you need
she looked me deep in the eyes she touchin me so to start
she say theres no turnin back she trapped me in her heart

verse 2
she likes the boys in the band she knows when they come to town
every musicians fan after the curtains come down
she waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
who promise fortune and fame a life thats so carefree
