its so hard just bein me sometimes
i wish i could escape out my mind
got too many situations complicatin things
i run out of time

prechorus
i know i havent turned the corner
please dont leave me behind
who the hell am i to think that youre my angel from above
its not right

chorus
who are we
who have we become
are we countin sheep
until we dissolve

verse 2
its a painful situation
do you feel complacent on the outside
its so close that i can taste it
beggin you to chase it god knows i try

prechorus
you got the life you always wanted
plеase dont leave mе behind
quite some time has passed
you fell right through my fingertips
i still look alright

who are we
who have we become
are we countin sheep
until we dissolve
who are we
who have we become
are we countin sheep
until we dissolve9embed"
