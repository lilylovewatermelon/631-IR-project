i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel

verse 1
im drunk and im feeling down
and i just want to be alone
im pissed cause you came around
why dont you just go home
cause ive channeled all your pain
and i cant help you fix yourself
youre making me insane
all i can say is

chorus
i tear my heart open—i sew myself shut
and my weakness is that i care too much
and our scars remind us that the past is real
tear my heart open just to feel

verse 2
i tried to help you once
against my own advice
i saw you goin down
but you never realized
that youre drowning in the water
and i offered you my hand
compassions in my nature
tonight is our last stand

verse 3
i’m drunk and i’m feeling down
and i just want to be alone
you shouldve never come around
why don’t you just go home
cause you’re drowning in the water
and i tried to grab your hand
i left my heart open
but you didn’t understand
but you didn’t understand
go fix yourself

bridge
i cant help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
im sorry but i gotta move on with my own life
i cant help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
im sorry but i gotta move on with my own life
