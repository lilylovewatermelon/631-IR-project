verse 1
first off gary was on dry and drunk before wed left bed
as things got bad it wasnt hard to say that he had no idea
well i hadnt noticed but the people really noticed
that they really didnt want us around
so we all just opened up our mouths and wallets to this town
well i was walkin just a little bit sideways
and you were walkin sideways too
well i hadnt learned when a front door cant be used here we go sir

verse 2
we had docked in dark so we didnt read what the sign read
though simple enough it was demure and tough
the ground needs to be fed
well i hadnt noticed but the people really noticed
that they really didnt want us around
so not a single one of us will ever leave town here we go sir

verse 3
our bodies were laid out evenly for fifteen yards
well two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar
well i hadnt noticed but the people really noticed
that they really didnt want us around
so every single one of us fed the ground here we go now
bridge
one wing one wing wasnt even enough
one wing one wing wasnt even enough wasnt even enough

outro
all part and parcel
well its probably been said
that its always been said
we were already deadembed"
