where you off to with that head of yours
is there somewhere you should be
was it something that i said the time i held you down
and told you its not you its only me
maybe

chorus dave grohl taylor hawkins
dont take what i dont need
give me back my peace of mind
dont say what i dont mean
give me back my precious time
no way youll silence me
youll see

verse 2
what you up to now your mirrors gone
is there someone you should be
did you think i was just foolin round with you
but honestly
but honestly
but honestly

chorus dave grohl taylor hawkins
dont take what i dont need
give me back my peace of mind
dont say what i dont mean
give me back my precious time
no way youll silence me
give me back my peace and quiet
nowhere to hide from me
youll see

and tonight i thank the stars as i count my lucky scars
for everything youve given me
and all the wants i gave to you something borrowed something blue
if you want them back
ill give it to you give it to you
give it to you ill give it to you
give it to you give it to you
give it to you ill give it to you

give it to you ill give it to you
ill give it to you give it to you
ill give it to you ill give it to you

i dont want one thing that i gave to you
i dont want one thing that i gave to you
i dont want one thing that i gave to you
i dont want one thing that i gave to you
