but you know i push the hummer in the summer
huh how you hard to be reached
i can put you where you hard to be reached
black sand on the balls of your feet
you can scream aint nobody gone be sleep
this your own private beach haha
and when it comes to sex
just a little bit of love and a little bit of that
baby push your back where your ribs is at
share a bowl of crunch berries how real is that haha
im just jokin of course
im tryin to put your sex game back on course
if you feelin dry like you dont get moist
if you ever get a minute holler at your boyembed"
