did you check the tires
put gas in the car
i dont think you need too much
cause you aint gonna get that far
did you pack the good times
dont forget a map
just in case the route you take
isnt there to take you back

chorus
you can hold any girl that you like
fall in love when its easy at night
but youll wake up wondering why
she aint ever something better
when youre lost and youve run out of road
find what i already know
in the end close is all there is
but you wont find this
no you wont find this

verse 2
theres once in a lifetime
and theres once in a while
and the difference between the two
is about a million miles
oh you might get lucky
while the moon is looking up
but in the truth of the morning
the starsll be long gone

you can hold any girl that you like
fall in love when its easy at night
but youll wake up wondering why
she aint ever something better
when youre lost and youve run out of road
find what i already know
in the end close is all there is
but you wont find this

instrumental break

chorus
you can hold any girl that you like
fall in love when its easy at night
but youll wake up wondering why
she aint ever something better
when youre lost and youve run out of road
find what i already know
in the end close is all there is
oh in the end its me youre gonna miss
cause you wont find this
oh you wont find thisembed"
