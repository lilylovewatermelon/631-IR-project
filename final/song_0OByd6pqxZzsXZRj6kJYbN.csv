verse 1 gerard way
where where will you stand
when all the lights go out across these city streets
where were you when all of the embers fell
i still remember then
covered in ash covered in glass covered in all my friends
i still think of the bombs they built

chorus gerard way
if theres a place that i could be
then id be another memory
can i be the only hope for you
because youre the only hope for me
and if we cant find where we belong
well have to make it on our own
face all the pain and take it on
because the only hope for me is you alone

verse 2 gerard way
how it should be many years after the disasters that weve seen
what have we learned other than people burn in purifying flame
i say its okay i know you can tell
and though you can see me smile
i still think of the guns they sell
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus gerard way

can i be the only hope for you
because youre the only hope for me
and if we cant find where we belong
well have to make it on our own

because the only hope for me is you alone
