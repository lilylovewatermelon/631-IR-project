theyre gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you son
so they can watch all the things you do
because the drugs never work theyre gonna give you a smirk
cause they got methods of keeping you clean
theyre gonna rip up your heads your aspirations to shreds
another cog in the murder machine

chorus
they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someonell bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe theyll leave you alone but not me

verse 2
the boys and girls in the clique the awful names that they stick
youre never gonna fit in much kid
but if youre troubled and hurt what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did

chorus
they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someonell bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe theyll leave you alone but not me oh yeah

they said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someonell bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe theyll leave you alone but not me
all together now

chorus
teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someonell bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe theyll leave you alone but not me
teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someonell bleed
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe theyll leave you alone but not me104embed"
