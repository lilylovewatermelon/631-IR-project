and he floats outside my prison window mocking those within
and he sings to me real low its hell to where you go
for you did murder kate mccannon
when i first met tom mccannon i was working in the mines
said he had himself a darkhaired daughter with long green eyes
when she and i did meet she was bathing in the creek
prettiest girl in the whole damn holler that aint no lie

so i went a courtin kate mccannon
got me a job and i quit my ramblin
and every day id save a quarter of my pay
i could buy a diamond ring
lord and one day i come home to find
my darlin angels not inside
so i made for the creek
where she and i did meet
and found her with some other lover

and i put three rounds into kate mccannonsee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also like4embed"
