here it is a new confession
youre a rather intelligent adolescent
and thats who you are i learned my lesson
i must not understand and just must be far too progressive

prechorus
i never meant to be that way
i just wanted to be kind
maybe i just think too much
its only in my mind this time

chorus
oh i know im not everything you thought i was
who you say you are is who youre not
and oh i tried you cried
i am not all you had thought
who you say you are is who youre not

and ill do my best my flesh
is still gonna make mistakes
who you say you are is who youre not
so please forgive if its really just some big nickname
who you say you are is who youre not

and ill do my best my flesh
is still gonna make mistakes
who you say you are is who youre not
so please forgive if its really just some big nickname
who you say you are is who youre not
