verse 1
take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model yeah
audemars this not a carnival this is a royal oak cartier
dom perignon i get down from a brown i get chauffeured around
i pour up with my rounds i pour up out of town
i corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
i grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
we order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around
i say everything triple time
rollie ap hublot triple time
i just know the ones you call upon
i just had to pay my dawg a bond
looking at me like a triple threat
every time a nigga talk a check
smoke the kush up like a cigarette
run it back you hear my intellect 8888808 mafia

verse 2
dont tell me you celibate to the mula
i just went rick the ruler with the jeweler
i just went st tropezin like a goonie
abu dhabi nigga straight out the sewer
like a loaded chopper im bout to shoot it
im so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
i just dived inside a cutie we spoonin
take it back and take a look at yourself
take the lesson put it all in the air
too many days gone by
sittin by the phone waitin til i reply
drying my eyes believe it or not
i could never see a tear fallin
water drippin on me like a faucet
i just took a bitch to eat at chipotle
spent another sixty thousand on a rollie
all my diamonds got you brainwashed
she sucked my dick it got my brain washed
and for that shit you got your man popped
see what they did to biggie and pac
pour a lil lil liquor out pour a lil more liquor out
pour it out pour it out pour it out

verse 3
drownin in actavis suicide
when i hit the scene its homicide
diamond pinky ring a lollipop
fuck the hate i pull up in a drop
diamonds colder than a glacier
ballin harder than the pacers
i been tryin to have some patience
told my mama she should pray on it
told the streets they gotta wait on it
she gon put a nigga name on it
i just dropped a whole thang on it
im making usds overseas
thats us dollars that you cant achieve
fucked my white girl she said nigga please
fuck that white girl she said nigga please
playin poker now were back in stroker
i forgot her name but her pussy soakin
when i seen her on the pole
reminded myself when i used to come over
reminded myself when i used to get loaded
remindin myself that im still gettin loaded
the coupe fully loaded this whip fully loaded
this whip fully loaded the clip fully loaded
i try to control it
lets wrap up some bottles lets pop off some bottles these niggas too bogus
lets pour up a pint ima fuck around faint like im kid cudi probably

verse 4
you thought i forgot about us
i know that you know i dont fold under pressure
im back on the road i get low on the pedal
we live by the codes of the ghetto
im closing this out with my memo
im treating this shit like a demo
im putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
im in that dolce gabbana
i might get after madonna
i get it crack in the summer
strapped in the lac and the hummer
fronted a pack to my partner
all this lingo got her panties to dropping
fuck the fame im sipping lean when im driving
all this cash and it aint nowhere to hide it
im an addict and i cant even hide it
dont you panic panoramic companion
they was tryna serve me at the arraignment
never comment on it never complaining
im taking everything that come with these millions
im taking everything that come with my children
yeah yeah
