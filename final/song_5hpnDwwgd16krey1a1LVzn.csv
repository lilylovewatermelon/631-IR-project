perfection is my direction
even if thats all i had
its not like i need no correction
i just know that lifes not so bad

verse 1
picture this everyday kids that just cant find a way
stuck in disarray cant find hope for better day
its the degeneration of childhood frustration
over the past 30 years teenaged suicide has increased
300 in north america
and is the second major cause of death in canada

chorus
perfection is my direction
even if thats all i had
its not like i need no correction
i just know that lifes not so bad

verse 2
when will all my problems disappear
am i just going crazy from the fear
oh my oh my im going far past the brink
this pressure is like a weight and i still cant think straight
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likechorus
prevention is my direction
even if thats all i had
its not like i need no correction
i just know that lifes not so bad

verse 3
ive met my destinations
whats left to complain about
all these aggravations
building til the seams fall out
im running my mouth dry
with every time i lie

bridge
but dont tell me without a doubt
with dumbfound luck has all run out
but dont tell me without a doubt
with dumbfound luck has all run out
ran out
ran out
ran out

chorus
perfection is my direction
even if thats all i had
its not like i need no correction
i just know that lifes not so bad1embed"
