kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

searchin for a sound we hadnt heard before

the lights are so bright but they never blind me me

when we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want
boys and boys and girls and girls
