i heard every word you said
i am trying hard to understand
exactly what it is you need from me

baby i apologize i never meant to make you cry
but there is not no doubt we can work it out yeah
because i am going to be around

chorus
do not worry baby i is not no maybe
rain or shine this love of mine is for you
let my arms remind you i will always be beside you
holding on until this ride is through
so away we go down that forever road

verse 2
baby as our lives unfold there is no telling where we will go
but as far as i can see it will be you and me
just the way it is supposed to be

chorus

it is not going to be easy we will both make big mistakes
but if you love trust me we have got what it takes
