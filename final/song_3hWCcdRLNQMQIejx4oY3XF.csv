in this old house im not alone
in a bedroom a telephone
you made a call and i just stood by
i stripped the sheets and emptied out the sty
chorus 1
and the crowds that light the carnival are
calling us home calling us home
and all we wants another voice
to lead us along lead us along lead us along

verse 2
even wasting my time with you
doesnt matter if i think it through
you took the car around another bend
ran it in the ground lets pretend

chorus 2
and the crowds that light the carnival are
calling us home calling us home
and all we ask another voice
to lead us along lead us along lead us along

outro
i cant get out of what im into with you
i cant get out of what im into with you
i cant get out of what im into with you
i cant get out of what im into with youyou might also like6embed"
