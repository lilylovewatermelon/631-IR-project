im tired from exploring you
im sorry youve had some scary days
im lucky they had me on a leash
exposing sometimes you frighten me

chorus
and its too bad youre so sad
i wish you could have had what i had

verse 2
im loathing most of your history
hesitation but then you siphon me
your potential well ill indulge in that
violent timing explains the aftermath

chorus
and its too bad youre so sad
i wish you could have had what i had
and its so sad its too bad
maybe i can make you feel better
oh maybe im supposed to make you feel better

postchorus
i want to comfort you
i want to comfort you
i want to comfort you
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likebridge
unlike you i had it easy
youre dark blue
stained from previous days

chorus
and youre so sad
its too bad
i wish you could have had what i had
and its too bad youre so sad
maybe i can make you feel better

outro
im sorry
im sorry
i want to comfort you
i want to comfort you
youre dark blue1embed"
