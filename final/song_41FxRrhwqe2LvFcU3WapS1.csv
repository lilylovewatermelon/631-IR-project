gotta find my way back home
ive been away too long
gotta find my way back home
im moving uh

verse 1 aap rocky
war lord we all lords but we your lords
tryna find home next stop is the waldorf
past the racism and fakeism
type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim
raw dogs you other niggas mad soft mad i rap my ass off
they throwin mad salt til i go bath salt
on wax spitting heat to melt the wax off
im mr miyagi in issey miyake
asshole flow fuck name brands past logos
now im onto grand raps hands so low uh
its like my fashion style is the life saver
guess she wasnt satisfied with titties that christ gave her
bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
head is so good on that girl that i might pay her or nah
super laid back cat opposite of fat black al capone
tell em lil niggas flacko home

chorus acyde
gotta find my way back home
ive been away too long
gotta find my way back home
ive been away too long
gotta find my way back home
ive been away too long
gotta find my way back home
ive been away too long

uh father lord forgive me as i load up the semi
roll through the city that chose to resent me
hold it dont load it reload it on plenty
any foe or a beep that ever voted against me dissed me
pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
never hesitated the designated all of the wrong that they did me
is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that i thought of
means more for my enemies
sippin holy water like its bore from my kidneys
load the smoke like a chimney make a toast for the memories
make a toast for the henny its the best for the remedies
energy synergy frienemies industries
