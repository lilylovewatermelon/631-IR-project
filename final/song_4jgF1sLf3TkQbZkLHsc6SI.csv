you could say i lived a crazy life for a man so young
the kind that made me question my faith
now im looking back just wondering where the time has gone
but i guess its just the price you pay yeah
ive already loved more than i thought i could love someone
ive already felt my heart break yeah
ive already fell so many times but i got back up
but at least i did it all my way

chorus
ive been through it all
yeah ive been through it all
yeah you wont see me crying if tomorrow never comes
god only knows ive been through it all

verse 2
growing up in this wild city you had to fight or run
now you know why im not afraid yeah
maybe its my recklessness that got me in trouble
but at least i did it all my way

chorus
ive been through it all
yeah ive been through it all
yeah you wont see me crying if tomorrow never comes
god only knows ive been through it all
