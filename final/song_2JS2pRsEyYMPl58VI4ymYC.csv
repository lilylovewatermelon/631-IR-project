world is covered by our trails
scars we cover up with paint
watch them preaching sour lies
i would rather see this world through the eyes of a child
through the eyes of a child

verse 2
darker times will come and go
times you need to see her smile
and mothers hands are warm and mild
i would rather feel this world through the skin of a child
through the skin of a child

instrumental

verse 3
when a human strokes your skin
that is when you let them in
let them in before they go
i would rather feel alive with a childlike soul
with a childlike soul
