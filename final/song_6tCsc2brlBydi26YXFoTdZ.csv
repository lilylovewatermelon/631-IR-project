i saw you there
your long brown hair
falling on your face the way it used to fall on mine
at one time
a long time ago
i still remember everything you said to me that night

prechorus
its too bad and its too late
you were such a big mistake
please dont call here anymore
i used to miss you

chorus
theres no surf in colorado anyway
and its a shame to hear youre happy
and you still look at me that way
theres no surf in colorado anyway yeah
she never waved to me or said goodbye
one night she just left me and her behind

verse 2

and no one knows
