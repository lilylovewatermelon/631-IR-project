today i will wear my white buttondown
im tired of wanting more i think im finally worn
for you have a way of promising things
and ive been a forest fire i am a forest fire

chorus
and i am the fire and i am the forest
and i am a witness watching it
i stand in a valley watching it
and you are not there at all

verse 2
so today i will wear my white buttondown
i can at least be neat walk out and be seen as clean
and ill go to work and ill go to sleep
and ill love the littler things

outro
