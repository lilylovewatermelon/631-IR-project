ive never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and im not proud of my address
in a tornup town no postcode envy

prechorus
but every songs like
gold teeth grey goose trippin in the bathroom
bloodstains ball gowns trashin the hotel room
we dont care were driving cadillacs in our dreams
but everybodys like
cristal maybach diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
we dont care we arent caught up in your love affair

chorus
and well never be royals royals
it dont run in our blood
that kind of luxe just aint for us
we crave a different kind of buzz
let me be your ruler ruler
you can call me queen bee
and baby ill rule ill rule ill rule ill rule
let me live that fantasy

we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows
that were fine with this we didnt come from money

jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
we dont care we arent caught up in your love affair
