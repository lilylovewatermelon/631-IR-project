come so defeated
it all turned to gray
the days much colder and theres not much left to say
try to stop from shaking
want to feel you close
you kept your distance when i needed you the most

chorus
the sun wont rise
it never shines
i know youre mine
but still i die

verse 2
it makes no difference
if we turn away
no hope for me now and im better off that way
only left a moment
thats all it took
no stopping me now
foundations shook
burn down the bridges
burn down the town
forget tomorrow
no lights around
search all the ditches
and all the sounds
that joy you borrowed
wont come around
you might also likechorus
the sun wont rise
it never shines
i know youre mine
but still i die

outro
theres no hope
no hope
no hope
for the wicked inside my soul
no hope
no hope
no hope
for the wicked and all the pain
no hope
no hope
no hope
for the wicked inside my soul
no hope
no hope
no hope
for the wicked or the goodembed"
