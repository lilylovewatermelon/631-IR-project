verse 1
im obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
and im aggressive just one thought aint close enough
you got me stressin incessantly pressin the issue
cause every moment gone you know i miss you
im the question and youre of course the answer
just hold me close boy cause im your tiny dancer
you make me shaken im never mistaken
but i cant control myself got me callin out for help
