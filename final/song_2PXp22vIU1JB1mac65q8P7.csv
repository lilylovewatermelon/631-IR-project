     i am doubtful whether i was at heart glad or sorry when my schooldays drew to an end and the time came for my leaving doctor strongs i had been very happy there i had a great attachment for the doctor and i was eminent and distinguished in that little world for these reasons i was sorry to go but for other reasons unsubstantial enough i was glad misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal of the importance attaching to a young man at his own disposal of the wonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal and the wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society lured me away so powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind that i seem according to my present way of thinking to have left school without natural regret the separation has not made the impression on me that other separations have i try in vain to recall how i felt about it and what its circumstances were but it is not momentous in my recollection i suppose the opening prospect confused me i know that my juvenile experiences went for little or nothing then and that life was more like a great fairy story which i was just about to begin to read than anything else

     my aunt and i had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which i should be devoted for a year or more i had endeavoured to find a satisfactory answer to her oftenrepeated question what i would like to be but i had no particular liking that i could discover for anything if i could have been inspired with a knowledge of the science of navigation taken the command of a fastsailing expedition and gone round the world on a triumphant voyage of discovery i think i might have considered myself completely suited but in the absence of any such miraculous provision my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse and to do my duty in it whatever it might be

     mr dick had regularly assisted at our councils with a meditative and sage demeanour he never made a suggestion but once and on that occasion i dont know what put it in his head he suddenly proposed that i should be a brazier my aunt received this proposal so very ungraciously that he never ventured on a second but ever afterwards confined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions and rattling his money

     trot i tell you what my dear said my aunt one morning in the christmas season when i left school as this knotty point is still unsettled and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it i think we had better take a little breathingtime in the meanwhile you must try to look at it from a new point of view and not as a schoolboy

     i will aunt

     it has occurred to me pursued my aunt that a little change and a glimpse of life out of doors may be useful in helping you to know your own mind and form a cooler judgement suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again for instance and see that—that outoftheway woman with the savagest of names said my aunt rubbing her nose for she could never thoroughly forgive peggotty for being so called

     of all things in the world aunt i should like it best

     well said my aunt thats lucky for i should like it too but its natural and rational that you should like it and i am very well persuaded that whatever you do trot will always be natural and rational

     i hope so aunt

     your sister betsey trotwood said my aunt would have been as natural and rational a girl as ever breathed youll be worthy of her wont you

     i hope i shall be worthy of you aunt that will be enough for me

     its a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours didnt live said my aunt looking at me approvingly or shed have been so vain of her boy by this time that her soft little head would have been completely turned if there was anything of it left to turn my aunt always excused any weakness of her own in my behalf by transferring it in this way to my poor mother bless me trotwood how you do remind me of her
     pleasantly i hope aunt said i

     hes as like her dick said my aunt emphatically hes as like her as she was that afternoon before she began to fret—bless my heart hes as like her as he can look at me out of his two eyes

     is he indeed said mr dick

     and hes like david too said my aunt decisively

     he is very like david said mr dick

     but what i want you to be trot resumed my aunt —i dont mean physically but morally you are very well physically—is a firm fellow a fine firm fellow with a will of your own with resolution said my aunt shaking her cap at me and clenching her hand with determination with character trot—with strength of character that is not to be influenced except on good reason by anybody or by anything thats what i want you to be thats what your father and mother might both have been heaven knows and been the better for it

     i intimated that i hoped i should be what she described

     that you may begin in a small way to have a reliance upon yourself and to act for yourself said my aunt i shall send you upon your trip alone i did think once of mr dicks going with you but on second thoughts i shall keep him to take care of me

     mr dick for a moment looked a little disappointed until the honour and dignity of having to take care of the most wonderful woman in the world restored the sunshine to his face

     besides said my aunt theres the memorial—

     oh certainly said mr dick in a hurry i intend trotwood to get that done immediately—it really must be done immediately and then it will go in you know—and then— said mr dick after checking himself and pausing a long time therell be a pretty kettle of fish

     in pursuance of my aunts kind scheme i was shortly afterwards fitted out with a handsome purse of money and a portmanteau and tenderly dismissed upon my expedition at parting my aunt gave me some good advice and a good many kisses and said that as her object was that i should look about me and should think a little she would recommend me to stay a few days in london if i liked it either on my way down into suffolk or in coming back in a word i was at liberty to do what i would for three weeks or a month and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than the beforementioned thinking and looking about me and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself

     i went to canterbury first that i might take leave of agnes and mr wickfield my old room in whose house i had not yet relinquished and also of the good doctor agnes was very glad to see me and told me that the house had not been like itself since i had left it
     i am sure i am not like myself when i am away said i i seem to want my right hand when i miss you though thats not saying much for theres no head in my right hand and no heart everyone who knows you consults with you and is guided by you agnes

     everyone who knows me spoils me i believe she answered smiling

     no its because you are like no one else you are so good and so sweettempered you have such a gentle nature and you are always right

     you talk said agnes breaking into a pleasant laugh as she sat at work as if i were the late miss larkins

     come its not fair to abuse my confidence i answered reddening at the recollection of my blue enslaver but i shall confide in you just the same agnes i can never grow out of that whenever i fall into trouble or fall in love i shall always tell you if youll let me—even when i come to fall in love in earnest

     why you have always been in earnest said agnes laughing again

     oh that was as a child or a schoolboy said i laughing in my turn not without being a little shamefaced times are altering now and i suppose i shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other my wonder is that you are not in earnest yourself by this time agnes

     agnes laughed again and shook her head

     oh i know you are not said i because if you had been you would have told me or at least—for i saw a faint blush in her face you would have let me find it out for myself but there is no one that i know of who deserves to love you agnes someone of a nobler character and more worthy altogether than anyone i have ever seen here must rise up before i give my consent in the time to come i shall have a wary eye on all admirers and shall exact a great deal from the successful one i assure you

     we had gone on so far in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest that had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations begun as mere children but agnes now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine and speaking in a different manner said

     trotwood there is something that i want to ask you and that i may not have another opportunity of asking for a long time perhaps—something i would ask i think of no one else have you observed any gradual alteration in papa

     i had observed it and had often wondered whether she had too i must have shown as much now in my face for her eyes were in a moment cast down and i saw tears in them

     tell me what it is she said in a low voice
     i think—shall i be quite plain agnes liking him so much

     yes she said

     i think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon him since i first came here he is often very nervous—or i fancy so

     it is not fancy said agnes shaking her head

     his hand trembles his speech is not plain and his eyes look wild i have remarked that at those times and when he is least like himself he is most certain to be wanted on some business

     by uriah said agnes

     yes and the sense of being unfit for it or of not having understood it or of having shown his condition in spite of himself seems to make him so uneasy that next day he is worse and next day worse and so he becomes jaded and haggard do not be alarmed by what i say agnes but in this state i saw him only the other evening lay down his head upon his desk and shed tears like a child

     her hand passed softly before my lips while i was yet speaking and in a moment she had met her father at the door of the room and was hanging on his shoulder the expression of her face as they both looked towards me i felt to be very touching there was such deep fondness for him and gratitude to him for all his love and care in her beautiful look and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him even in my inmost thoughts and to let no harsh construction find any place against him she was at once so proud of him and devoted to him yet so compassionate and sorry and so reliant upon me to be so too that nothing she could have said would have expressed more to me or moved me more

     we were to drink tea at the doctors we went there at the usual hour and round the study fireside found the doctor and his young wife and her mother the doctor who made as much of my going away as if i were going to china received me as an honoured guest and called for a log of wood to be thrown on the fire that he might see the face of his old pupil reddening in the blaze

     i shall not see many more new faces in trotwoods stead wickfield said the doctor warming his hands i am getting lazy and want ease i shall relinquish all my young people in another six months and lead a quieter life

     you have said so any time these ten years doctor mr wickfield answered

     but now i mean to do it returned the doctor my first master will succeed me—i am in earnest at last—so youll soon have to arrange our contracts and to bind us firmly to them like a couple of knaves

     and to take care said mr wickfield that youre not imposed on eh as you certainly would be in any contract you should make for yourself well i am ready there are worse tasks than that in my calling

     i shall have nothing to think of then said the doctor with a smile but my dictionary and this other contractbargain—annie

     as mr wickfield glanced towards her sitting at the tea table by agnes she seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation and timidity that his attention became fixed upon her as if something were suggested to his thoughts

     there is a post come in from india i observe he said after a short silence

     by the by and letters from mr jack maldon said the doctor

     indeed poor dear jack said mrs markleham shaking her head that trying climate—like living they tell me on a sandheap underneath a burningglass he looked strong but he wasnt my dear doctor it was his spirit not his constitution that he ventured on so boldly annie my dear i am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never was strong—not what can be called robust you know said mrs markleham with emphasis and looking round upon us generally —from the time when my daughter and himself were children together and walking about arminarm the livelong day

     annie thus addressed made no reply

     do i gather from what you say maam that mr maldon is ill asked mr wickfield

     ill replied the old soldier my dear sir hes all sorts of things

     except well said mr wickfield

     except well indeed said the old soldier he has had dreadful strokes of the sun no doubt and jungle fevers and agues and every kind of thing you can mention as to his liver said the old soldier resignedly that of course he gave up altogether when he first went out

     does he say all this asked mr wickfield

     say my dear sir returned mrs markleham shaking her head and her fan you little know my poor jack maldon when you ask that question say not he you might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first

     mama said mrs strong

     annie my dear returned her mother once for all i must really beg that you will not interfere with me unless it is to confirm what i say you know as well as i do that your cousin maldon would be dragged at the heels of any number of wild horses—why should i confine myself to four i wont confine myself to four—eight sixteen twoandthirty rather than say anything calculated to overturn the doctors plans

     wickfields plans said the doctor stroking his face and looking penitently at his adviser that is to say our joint plans for him i said myself abroad or at home

     and i said added mr wickfield gravely abroad i was the means of sending him abroad its my responsibility

     oh responsibility said the old soldier everything was done for the best my dear mr wickfield everything was done for the kindest and best we know but if the dear fellow cant live there he cant live there and if he cant live there hell die there sooner than hell overturn the doctors plans i know him said the old soldier fanning herself in a sort of calm prophetic agony and i know hell die there sooner than hell overturn the doctors plans

     well well maam said the doctor cheerfully i am not bigoted to my plans and i can overturn them myself i can substitute some other plans if mr jack maldon comes home on account of ill health he must not be allowed to go back and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country

     mrs markleham was so overcome by this generous speech—which i need not say she had not at all expected or led up to—that she could only tell the doctor it was like himself and go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan and then tapping his hand with it after which she gently chid her daughter annie for not being more demonstrative when such kindnesses were showered for her sake on her old playfellow and entertained us with some particulars concerning other deserving members of her family whom it was desirable to set on their deserving legs

     all this time her daughter annie never once spoke or lifted up her eyes all this time mr wickfield had his glance upon her as she sat by his own daughters side it appeared to me that he never thought of being observed by anyone but was so intent upon her and upon his own thoughts in connexion with her as to be quite absorbed he now asked what mr jack maldon had actually written in reference to himself and to whom he had written

     why here said mrs markleham taking a letter from the chimneypiece above the doctors head the dear fellow says to the doctor himself—where is it oh—i am sorry to inform you that my health is suffering severely and that i fear i may be reduced to the necessity of returning home for a time as the only hope of restoration thats pretty plain poor fellow his only hope of restoration but annies letter is plainer still annie show me that letter again

     not now mama she pleaded in a low tone

     my dear you absolutely are on some subjects one of the most ridiculous persons in the world returned her mother and perhaps the most unnatural to the claims of your own family we never should have heard of the letter at all i believe unless i had asked for it myself do you call that confidence my love towards doctor strong i am surprised you ought to know better

     the letter was reluctantly produced and as i handed it to the old lady i saw how the unwilling hand from which i took it trembled

     now let us see said mrs markleham putting her glass to her eye where the passage is the remembrance of old times my dearest annie—and so forth—its not there the amiable old proctor—whos he dear me annie how illegibly your cousin maldon writes and how stupid i am doctor of course ah amiable indeed here she left off to kiss her fan again and shake it at the doctor who was looking at us in a state of placid satisfaction now i have found it you may not be surprised to hear annie—no to be sure knowing that he never was really strong what did i say just now—that i have undergone so much in this distant place as to have decided to leave it at all hazards on sick leave if i can on total resignation if that is not to be obtained what i have endured and do endure here is insupportable and but for the promptitude of that best of creatures said mrs markleham telegraphing the doctor as before and refolding the letter it would be insupportable to me to think of

     mr wickfield said not one word though the old lady looked to him as if for his commentary on this intelligence but sat severely silent with his eyes fixed on the ground long after the subject was dismissed and other topics occupied us he remained so seldom raising his eyes unless to rest them for a moment with a thoughtful frown upon the doctor or his wife or both

     the doctor was very fond of music agnes sang with great sweetness and expression and so did mrs strong they sang together and played duets together and we had quite a little concert but i remarked two things first that though annie soon recovered her composure and was quite herself there was a blank between her and mr wickfield which separated them wholly from each other secondly that mr wickfield seemed to dislike the intimacy between her and agnes and to watch it with uneasiness and now i must confess the recollection of what i had seen on that night when mr maldon went away first began to return upon me with a meaning it had never had and to trouble me the innocent beauty of her face was not as innocent to me as it had been i mistrusted the natural grace and charm of her manner and when i looked at agnes by her side and thought how good and true agnes was suspicions arose within me that it was an illassorted friendship

     she was so happy in it herself however and the other was so happy too that they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour it closed in an incident which i well remember they were taking leave of each other and agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her when mr wickfield stepped between them as if by accident and drew agnes quickly away then i saw as though all the intervening time had been cancelled and i were still standing in the doorway on the night of the departure the expression of that night in the face of mrs strong as it confronted his

     i cannot say what an impression this made upon me or how impossible i found it when i thought of her afterwards to separate her from this look and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again it haunted me when i got home i seemed to have left the doctors roof with a dark cloud lowering on it the reverence that i had for his grey head was mingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous to him and with resentment against those who injured him the impending shadow of a great affliction and a great disgrace that had no distinct form in it yet fell like a stain upon the quiet place where i had worked and played as a boy and did it a cruel wrong i had no pleasure in thinking any more of the grave old broadleaved aloetrees which remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together and of the trim smooth grassplot and the stone urns and the doctors walk and the congenial sound of the cathedral bell hovering above them all it was as if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face and its peace and honour given to the winds

     but morning brought with it my parting from the old house which agnes had filled with her influence and that occupied my mind sufficiently i should be there again soon no doubt i might sleep again—perhaps often—in my old room but the days of my inhabiting there were gone and the old time was past i was heavier at heart when i packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to dover than i cared to show to uriah heep who was so officious to help me that i uncharitably thought him mighty glad that i was going

     i got away from agnes and her father somehow with an indifferent show of being very manly and took my seat upon the box of the london coach i was so softened and forgiving going through the town that i had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher and throw him five shillings to drink but he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he stood scraping the great block in the shop and moreover his appearance was so little improved by the loss of a front tooth which i had knocked out that i thought it best to make no advances

     the main object on my mind i remember when we got fairly on the road was to appear as old as possible to the coachman and to speak extremely gruff the latter point i achieved at great personal inconvenience but i stuck to it because i felt it was a grownup sort of thing

     you are going through sir said the coachman

     yes william i said condescendingly i knew him i am going to london i shall go down into suffolk afterwards

     shooting sir said the coachman

     he knew as well as i did that it was just as likely at that time of year i was going down there whaling but i felt complimented too

     i dont know i said pretending to be undecided whether i shall take a shot or not birds is got wery shy im told said william

     so i understand said i

     is suffolk your county sir asked william

     yes i said with some importance suffolks my county

     im told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there said william

     i was not aware of it myself but i felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county and to evince a familiarity with them so i shook my head as much as to say i believe you

     and the punches said william theres cattle a suffolk punch when hes a good un is worth his weight in gold did you ever breed any suffolk punches yourself sir

     nno i said not exactly

     heres a genlmn behind me ill pound it said william as has bred em by wholesale

     the gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint and a prominent chin who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim and whose closefitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips his chin was cocked over the coachmans shoulder so near to me that his breath quite tickled the back of my head and as i looked at him he leered at the leaders with the eye with which he didnt squint in a very knowing manner

     aint you asked william

     aint i what said the gentleman behind

     bred them suffolk punches by wholesale

     i should think so said the gentleman there aint no sort of orse that i aint bred and no sort of dorg orses and dorgs is some mens fancy theyre wittles and drink to me—lodging wife and children—reading writing and arithmetic—snuff tobacker and sleep

     that aint a sort of man to see sitting behind a coachbox is it though said william in my ear as he handled the reins

     i construed this remark into an indication of a wish that he should have my place so i blushingly offered to resign it

     well if you dont mind sir said william i think it would be more correct

     i have always considered this as the first fall i had in life when i booked my place at the coach office i had had box seat written against the entry and had given the bookkeeper halfacrown i was got up in a special greatcoat and shawl expressly to do honour to that distinguished eminence had glorified myself upon it a good deal and had felt that i was a credit to the coach and here in the very first stage i was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint who had no other merit than smelling like a liverystables and being able to walk across me more like a fly than a human being while the horses were at a canter

     a distrust of myself which has often beset me in life on small occasions when it would have been better away was assuredly not stopped in its growth by this little incident outside the canterbury coach it was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech i spoke from the pit of my stomach for the rest of the journey but i felt completely extinguished and dreadfully young

     it was curious and interesting nevertheless to be sitting up there behind four horses well educated well dressed and with plenty of money in my pocket and to look out for the places where i had slept on my weary journey i had abundant occupation for my thoughts in every conspicuous landmark on the road when i looked down at the trampers whom we passed and saw that wellremembered style of face turned up i felt as if the tinkers blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again when we clattered through the narrow street of chatham and i caught a glimpse in passing of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought my jacket i stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where i had sat in the sun and in the shade waiting for my money when we came at last within a stage of london and passed the veritable salem house where mr creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand i would have given all i had for lawful permission to get down and thrash him and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows

     we went to the golden cross at charing cross then a mouldy sort of establishment in a close neighbourhood a waiter showed me into the coffeeroom and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber which smelt like a hackneycoach and was shut up like a family vault i was still painfully conscious of my youth for nobody stood in any awe of me at all the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to my opinions on any subject and the waiter being familiar with me and offering advice to my inexperience

     well now said the waiter in a tone of confidence what would you like for dinner young gentlemen likes poultry in general have a fowl

     i told him as majestically as i could that i wasnt in the humour for a fowl

     aint you said the waiter young gentlemen is generally tired of beef and mutton have a weal cutlet

     i assented to this proposal in default of being able to suggest anything else

     do you care for taters said the waiter with an insinuating smile and his head on one side young gentlemen generally has been overdosed with taters

     i commanded him in my deepest voice to order a veal cutlet and potatoes and all things fitting and to inquire at the bar if there were any letters for trotwood copperfield esquire—which i knew there were not and couldnt be but thought it manly to appear to expect

     he soon came back to say that there were none at which i was much surprised and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire while he was so engaged he asked me what i would take with it and on my replying half a pint of sherrythought it a favourable opportunity i am afraid to extract that measure of wine from the stale leavings at the bottoms of several small decanters i am of this opinion because while i was reading the newspaper i observed him behind a low wooden partition which was his private apartment very busy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one like a chemist and druggist making up a prescription when the wine came too i thought it flat and it certainly had more english crumbs in it than were to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state but i was bashful enough to drink it and say nothing

     being then in a pleasant frame of mind from which i infer that poisoning is not always disagreeable in some stages of the process i resolved to go to the play it was covent garden theatre that i chose and there from the back of a centre box i saw julius caesar and the new pantomime to have all those noble romans alive before me and walking in and out for my entertainment instead of being the stern taskmasters they had been at school was a most novel and delightful effect but the mingled reality and mystery of the whole show the influence upon me of the poetry the lights the music the company the smooth stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery were so dazzling and opened up such illimitable regions of delight that when i came out into the rainy street at twelve oclock at night i felt as if i had come from the clouds where i had been leading a romantic life for ages to a bawling splashing linklighted umbrellastruggling hackneycoachjostling pattenclinking muddy miserable world

     i had emerged by another door and stood in the street for a little while as if i really were a stranger upon earth but the unceremonious pushing and hustling that i received soon recalled me to myself and put me in the road back to the hotel whither i went revolving the glorious vision all the way and where after some porter and oysters i sat revolving it still at past one oclock with my eyes on the coffeeroom fire

     i was so filled with the play and with the past—for it was in a manner like a shining transparency through which i saw my earlier life moving along—that i dont know when the figure of a handsome wellformed young man dressed with a tasteful easy negligence which i have reason to remember very well became a real presence to me but i recollect being conscious of his company without having noticed his coming in—and my still sitting musing over the coffeeroom fire

     at last i rose to go to bed much to the relief of the sleepy waiter who had got the fidgets in his legs and was twisting them and hitting them and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry in going towards the door i passed the person who had come in and saw him plainly i turned directly came back and looked again he did not know me but i knew him in a moment

     at another time i might have wanted the confidence or the decision to speak to him and might have put it off until next day and might have lost him but in the then condition of my mind where the play was still running high his former protection of me appeared so deserving of my gratitude and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly and spontaneously that i went up to him at once with a fastbeating heart and said

     steerforth wont you speak to me

     he looked at me—just as he used to look sometimes—but i saw no recognition in his face

     you dont remember me i am afraid said i

     my god he suddenly exclaimed its little copperfield

     i grasped him by both hands and could not let them go but for very shame and the fear that it might displease him i could have held him round the neck and cried

     i never never never was so glad my dear steerforth i am so overjoyed to see you

     and i am rejoiced to see you too he said shaking my hands heartily why copperfield old boy dont be overpowered and yet he was glad too i thought to see how the delight i had in meeting him affected me

     i brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able to keep back and i made a clumsy laugh of it and we sat down together side by side

     why how do you come to be here said steerforth clapping me on the shoulder

     i came here by the canterbury coach today i have been adopted by an aunt down in that part of the country and have just finished my education there how do you come to be here steerforth

     well i am what they call an oxford man he returned that is to say i get bored to death down there periodically—and i am on my way now to my mothers youre a devilish amiablelooking fellow copperfield just what you used to be now i look at you not altered in the least

     i knew you immediately i said but you are more easily remembered

     he laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair and said gaily

     yes i am on an expedition of duty my mother lives a little way out of town and the roads being in a beastly condition and our house tedious enough i remained here tonight instead of going on i have not been in town halfadozen hours and those i have been dozing and grumbling away at the play

     i have been at the play too said i at covent garden what a delightful and magnificent entertainment steerforth

     steerforth laughed heartily

     my dear young davy he said clapping me on the shoulder again you are a very daisy the daisy of the field at sunrise is not fresher than you are i have been at covent garden too and there never was a more miserable business holloa you sir

     this was addressed to the waiter who had been very attentive to our recognition at a distance and now came forward deferentially

     where have you put my friend mr copperfield said steerforth

     beg your pardon sir

     where does he sleep whats his number you know what i mean said steerforth

     well sir said the waiter with an apologetic air mr copperfield is at present in fortyfour sir

     and what the devil do you mean retorted steerforth by putting mr copperfield into a little loft over a stable

     why you see we wasnt aware sir returned the waiter still apologetically as mr copperfield was anyways particular we can give mr copperfield seventytwo sir if it would be preferred next you sir

     of course it would be preferred said steerforth and do it at once the waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange steerforth very much amused at my having been put into fortyfour laughed again and clapped me on the shoulder again and invited me to breakfast with him next morning at ten oclock—an invitation i was only too proud and happy to accept it being now pretty late we took our candles and went upstairs where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door and where i found my new room a great improvement on my old one it not being at all musty and having an immense fourpost bedstead in it which was quite a little landed estate here among pillows enough for six i soon fell asleep in a blissful condition and dreamed of ancient rome steerforth and friendship until the early morning coaches rumbling out of the archway underneath made me dream of thunder and the godsembed"
