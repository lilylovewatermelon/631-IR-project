lie down with me my dear lie down
under stormy night tell nobody

verse 1
my brother where do you intend to go tonight
i heard that you missed your connecting flight
to the blue ridge mountains over near tennessee

verse 2
youre ever welcome with me any time you like
lets drive to the countryside leave behind some greeneyed lookalikes
so no one gets worried no
so no one gets worried no

interlude
but sean dont get careless
im sure itll be fine
i love you i love you
oh brother of mine

chorus
in the quivering forest
where the shivering dog rests
our good grandfather
built a wooden nest
and the river got frozen
and the home got snowed in
and a yellow moon glowed bright
till the morning light

terrible am i child
even if you dont mind
