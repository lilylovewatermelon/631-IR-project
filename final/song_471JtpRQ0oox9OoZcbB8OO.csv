i wanna smash your fears
and get drunken off your tears
dont you share your smile with anyone else but me
i wanna touch your heart
i wanna crush it in my hands
make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies

refrain
were not lovers but more than friends
put a flame to every single word you ever said
no more crying
to get me through
ill keep dancing til the morning with somebody new
tonight im getting over you

chorus
tonight im getting over you
tonight im getting over you
tonight im getting over you
over you over you

and man it feels so new to me
