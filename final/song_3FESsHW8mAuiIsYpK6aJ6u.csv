broke my heart on the road
spent the weekend sewing the pieces back on
crayons and dolls pass me by
walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly
not the homecoming kind
take the top off and who knows what you might find
wont confess all my sins
you can bet all trying but you cant always win

chorus
cause im a gypsy
are you coming with me
i might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
never made agreements
just like a gypsy
and i wont back down ‘cause lifes already bit me
and i wont cry im too young to die
if youre gonna quit me
‘cause im a gypsy

refrain
cause im a gypsy

verse 2
i cant hide what ive done
scars remind me of just how far that ive come
to whom it may concern
only run with scissors when you want to get hurt
you might also likechorus
cause im a gypsy
are you coming with me
i might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
i dont make agreements
just like a gypsy
and i wont back down ‘cause lifes already bit me
and i wont cry im too young to die
if youre gonna quit me
cause im a gypsy

bridge
and i say hey you youre no fool if you say ‘no’
aint it just the way life goes
people fear what they dont know
come along for the ride oh yeah
come along for the ride ooh

chorus
‘cause im a gypsy
are you coming with me
i might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
never made agreements
just like a gypsy
and i wont back down cause lifes already bit me
and i wont cry im too young to die
if youre gonna quit me
cause im a gypsyembed"
