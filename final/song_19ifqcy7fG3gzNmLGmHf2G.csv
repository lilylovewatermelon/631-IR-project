verse 1
you were cold as the blood through your bones
and the light which led us from our chosen homes
well i was lost
and now i sleep
sleep the hours that i cant weep
when all i knew was steeped in blackened holes
well i was lost

chorus
keep the earth below my feet
for all my sweat my blood runs weak
let me learn from where i have been
keep my eyes to serve my hands to learn
keep my eyes to serve my hands to learn

verse 2
and i was still
but i was under your spell
when i was told by jesus all was well
so all must be well
just give me time
you know your desires and mine
so wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
for i must be well

keep the earth below my feet
for all my sweat my blood runs weak
let me learn from where i have been
oh keep my eyes to serve my hands to learn
keep my eyes to serve my hands to learn
