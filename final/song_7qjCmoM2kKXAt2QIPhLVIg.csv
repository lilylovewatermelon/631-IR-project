do you remember drinking in the parking lot
by the trailhead
i see you for a moment then the morning comes
and its wasted
we listen to only the good die young
and we laughed about its statement
we walked in the same direction but we both got lost
in your angst and my impatience

chorus
did you find what you were looking for
some escape from your skin
you know that place you were dreaming of
where all light comes in
i hope you know i grew my hair out long
and your sisters just fine
i keep burning my bridges down
just to keep you alive

refrain
woooooo
woooo oooooooo
woo

verse 2
do you remember looking from the fire tower at the sunset
jack white prophetic on my speakers we were going to be friends
yeah i guess i just got busy only saw you every other weekend
lord i just moved to this city hoping noise drowns out the regret
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
but did you find what you were looking for
some escape from your skin
you know that place you were dreaming of
where all light comes in
i hope you know i grew my hair out long
and your sisters just fine
i keep burning my bridges down
just to keep you alive

refrain
woooooo
just to keep you alive
woooo oooooooo
woo

bridge
they tell me grief is just love letting go
they say it like milk has been spilled on the floor
they say they dont know who i am anymore
well i just have never shown anger before

chorus
still havent found what im looking for
some escape from my sin
you know that place you been dreaming of
where all light comes in
and ill keep growing my hair out long
just to cover my eyes
and ill keep playing that goddamn song
if it keeps you alive
outro
woooooo
if it keeps you alive
woooo oooooooo
woo
i just wanna keep you alive2embed"
