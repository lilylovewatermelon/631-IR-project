baby lets pack our bags and head to wherever
toss these plans out straight through the door
wont you take my hand it wont be forever
i dont have to be the one youre looking for
but i broke my foot got lost on the mountain
fucked my life again but im sure
that youre not too far behind so im counting
on you to stay when my heart is sore
oh hey aye i think i lost my way
can you put me back in place hahaha

chorus
i know youd never let me down
but will you lift me off the ground
do ya even know my name
and even when im safe and sound
it could always turn around
but can you remember my face hahaha

i know youre depressed and i know that youre stressed
and i know that you lie to all your friends
i know that you cry and i know that you fight
and i know that you tried but it wont end
so how would it feel if i were to steal
your heart away along with this pain
cause you give me butterflies and i i need you to stay
i know what youre thinking you dont wanna say so
think im catching feelings i dont wanna say no
i like the way your socks look you should know i hate to
fall for someone new but i like to think about you hahaha

chorus
i know youd never let me down
but will you lift me off the ground
do ya even know my name
and even when im safe and sound
it could always turn around
but can you remember my face
