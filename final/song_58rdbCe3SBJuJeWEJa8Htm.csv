rollin north on 95
with a redhead ridin shotgun
and a pistol by my side
tearin down that highway
like a modern day bonnie and clyde

we met at a truckstop
johnson city tennessee
i was gassin up my firebird
when i heard her callin memmm hmm
said which way are you headed boy
do you need some company

she had me stoppin at a quick mart
before we made it out of town
next thing she was runnin at me
tellin me to lay that hammer down
cause theres a man right behind me
doin his best to slow me down

yeah and its a long way to richmond
rollin north on 95
with a redhead ridin shotgun

and a pistol by my side
tearin down that highway
like a modern day bonnie and clyde
see travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likewoo

well we pulled up to a motel
in the middle of the night
we were countin all the money
smokin stolen marlboro lights
lord we never saw em comin
til they read us both our rights

yeah and its a long way to richmond
rollin north on 95
with a sheriff right beside me
pistol pointed at my side
oh lordsuch a disappointing ending
for this modern day bonnie and clyde
yeah

whoa
