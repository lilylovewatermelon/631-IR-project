i thought this coming down was fine
now everything i fought to grow
is withered hanging on that vine

and all i wanted
was all i needed you know
everything good in my life
if you have to take it all away
oh no
take it all away
oh no no no
take it slow

everything i try to find
is every love ill never hold
but in your garden now
the weeds are choking seeds weve sown

and all i wanted
was all i needed you know
everything good in my life
if you have to take it all away
oh no
take it all away
oh no no no
take it slow
you might also likenow you find
your own savior for a time
and if you try my love
i hope youll find your cure in time

and all i wanted
was all i needed you know
everything good in my life
if you have to take it all away
oh no
take it all away
oh no no no
take it slow

take itslow
take itslow
take it slowembed"
