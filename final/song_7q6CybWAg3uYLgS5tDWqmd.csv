ahahahah
paper flowers

verse 1
i linger in the doorway
of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
where the raindrops as theyâ€™re falling tell a story

chorus
in my field of paper flowers ahahahah
and candy clouds of lullaby paper flowers
i lie inside myself for hours ahahahah
and watch my purple sky fly over me paper flowers

verse 2
dont say im out of touch
with this rampant chaos your reality
i know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
the nightmare i built my own world to escape

chorus
in my field of paper flowers ahahahah
and candy clouds of lullaby paper flowers
i lie inside myself for hours ahahahah
and watch my purple sky fly over me paper flowers

bridge
swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming
the goddess of imaginary light

in my field of paper flowers ahahahah
