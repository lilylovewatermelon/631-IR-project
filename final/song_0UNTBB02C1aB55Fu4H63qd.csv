verse 1 chingy
it was weird how we met huh
she was with her mom at bank america with my son cashin a check
so i asked out of respect uh
would she like to explore the world of i we can fly in my jet
her reply was yes can i ask you something
i seen it in her eye mama looking like all i wanted was sex
then moved to the next that aint true
but it was something about this girls style that make me feel no regrets
we started off casual walks through the park park
candle light dinners by dark dark im thinking smart smart
afraid she might think im in a rush to touch
crush and be up but baby i aint on that stuff
dropped her off and told her call me up brrring we could talk
conversate about political subjects whatever thoughts
so i zoomed off thinking bout her my phone rang
it was her in the shower what she say
she said i couldnt do without you then i said

verse 3 chingy
girl recognize game before game recognize you
you dealin with a playa true now what you wanna do
we can kick it and go puff on a blunt
oh you dont smoke grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
its up to you im the man but baby just let me know
cause if you got a attitude then i could treat you just like a ho
if ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
we can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
just be true and theres nothing i wont do for ya
some women like to play it foul
but them the kind i put in a place of a child
dont worry be happy and smile
