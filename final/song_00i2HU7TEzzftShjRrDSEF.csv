ooh yeah ooh
come on come on

verse 1 2pac
i see no changes wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth livin should i blast myself
im tired of bein poor and even worse im black
my stomach hurts so im lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
first ship em dope and let em deal to brothers
give em guns step back watch em kill each other
its time to fight back thats what huey said
two shots in the dark now hueys dead
i got love for my brother
but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
we gotta start makin changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and thats how its supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if hes close to me uh
id love to go back to when we played as kids
but things change and thats the way it is

verse 2 2pac  talent
i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place lets erase the wasted
take the evil out the people theyll be actin right
cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
and the only time we chill is when we kill each other kill each other
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
and although it seems heavensent
we aint ready to see a black president uh ohooh
it aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
but some things will never change never change
try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game ooh

interlude 2pac
we gotta make a change
its time for us as a people to start makin some changes
lets change the way we eat
lets change the way we live
and lets change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasnt workin
so its on us to do what we gotta do to survive

verse 3 2pac  talent
and still i see no changes cant a brother get a little peace
its war on the streets and the war in the middle east ooh yeah
instead of war on poverty
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
and i aint never did a crime i aint have to do
but now im back with the facts givin it back to you ooh
dont let em jack you up back you up
crack you up and pimpsmack you up
you gotta learn to hold your own
they get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
but tell the cops they cant touch this
i dont trust this when they try to rush i bust this
thats the sound of my tool you say it aint cool
my mama didnt raise no fool oh
and as long as i stay black i gotta stay strapped
and i never get to lay back
cause i always got to worry bout the payback
some buck that i roughed up way back
comin back after all these years
