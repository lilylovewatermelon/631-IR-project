you said you dont love me like that
im stuck here standing in the rain
you said i dont need you like that
but i do but i do
im telling that sun to come back
you make it brighter brighter
your figure fading in the gray
blue skies dont tease me like that
you make it brighter brighter
like you do like you do
im feeling like the worlds about to change
you make it brighter brighter
when hummingbirds are singing in the rain
dreaming that im standing in the light
you make it brighter brighter
do you love me

chorus
can you feel the sunshine
you make it brighter brighter
make it brighter make it brighter for me
one last sun comes shining on me
you make it brighter brighter

verse 2
feels like this storms holding back
soon ill be swimming in a dream
i walk but i fall off the track
to the blue to the blue
but i dont want to look the other way
you make it brighter brighter
and i dont want to wake up in a painting
dreaming of that rainy summer day
you make it brighter brighter
do you love me
