like walkin on the moon was such a good feelin
im lyin in bed and im starin at the ceilin
cant wake up on monday morning
thinkin about work makes me yawn
and as i look outside its rainin pourin
cats and dogs dont wanna think no more
and when i gotta get up and get out my bed
id rather sleep in late and smoke a bload instead

chorus kyle
because the harder you try the less you succeed
dont try at all and get everything you need
because the harder you fall the more its gon bleed
watch where you steppin cause you best not step on me

verse 2 kyle
if youre ugly on the outside it dont matter
if the beauty on the inside it over powers
if the beauty on the outside it wont matter
if youre ugly on the inside then i dont want
and if you the type of person gettin no recognition
reach inside your pocket feelin all your money missin
and you wanna shoot your guns but you got no ammunition
open up your mind body soul and take a listen

because the harder you try the less you succeed
dont try at all and get everything you need
because the harder you fall the more its gon bleed
watch where you steppin cause you best not step on me

verse 3 miles
its always hard when youre workin for the other man
tryin to make a dollar with the palms of my empty hands
it seems so easily but it never seems to last long
thinkin that you got it for a minute then a minutes goneembed"
