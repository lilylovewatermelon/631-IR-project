in the winding down hours
i let your heart down again
what’d i do to make a scene so gory
i’m no better than the ones before me
old habits die hard
i always end up hating the end
what’d i do to make a scene so gory
i’m no better than the ones before me

refrain
i’m in the middle of a breakdown
watching you scream
in the middle of a breakdown
screaming at me

chorus
and by the way
by the way
what made you think you’d have it your way
and by the way
by the way
don’t say i didn’t warn you
that i’ll always stay the same

verse 2
speechless and frozen
uncomfortable silence again
what’d i do to make a scene so gory
i’m no better than the ones before me
see hinder liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likerefrain
i’m in the middle of a breakdown
watching you scream
in the middle of a breakdown
screaming at me

chorus
and by the way
by the way
what made you think you’d have it your way
and by the way
by the way
don’t say i didn’t warn you
that i’ll always stay the same

bridge
battered and bruised
broken confused
it’s time we both knew
can’t stop what i started
this time we both lose
lose

i’ll always stay the same
battered and bruised
the same broken confused the same
i didn’t warn you that i’ll always stay the same3embed"
