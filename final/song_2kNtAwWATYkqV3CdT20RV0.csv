no one on the corner has swagger like moi
church but im too clean for the choir
i require what i desire i got stripes adidas

run up in your shit just me no mask
runnin this shit like i got four thighs
no one has swagger like these four guys
now when it comes to styles i got several
sharper than the swag or dagger all metal

verse 4 ti
aye you can go see weezy for the wordplay jeezy for the bird play
kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
all my verses picture perfect only spit to serve a purpose
you aint livin what you kickin then you worthless
lookin from the surface
it may seem like i got reason to be nervous
then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
verses autobiographical absolutely classical
last thing im worried about is what another rapper do
aint nobody hot as me
even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstandin quality
sell a lot of records ill respect it and salute that
but spittin real life on hot beats im the truth at
you kick it like me no exaggeration necessary
livin revolutionary nothin less than legendary
gangsta shit hereditary got it from my dad
flow colder than february with extraordinary swag
