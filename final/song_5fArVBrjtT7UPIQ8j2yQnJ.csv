passion in my eyes as i lived it everyday
but how could you go throw it all away
in my dreams its me and you
its there i saw it all come true
as time went by faith in you grew
so one thing left for me to do

verse 1
i feel it burn inside
burn in me like the rising sun
lifted into the sky
took away the only thing i loved
i know after tonight
all your power crumbles in my arms
so dont worry ill be fine
when my life ends ill leave this scar

and i felt down i need you there
every note and every word seems so hard to take
finally were destined

verse 2
a smoking gun in hand
now dont you realize what youve done
put a bullet in his back
your hero since you were so young
how could you kill the man
who brought salvation through your pain
he must mean everything
to end it all this shameful way

verse 3
i started here so young
and helped you get along
just did it for the love
and people healed through us
dont live your life in vain
dont take it out on me
youre cracked so just remember
im not your enemy
i dont deserve to fall this way
by a man who felt betrayed

verse 4
i felt so down now youre around to rescue me
every note and every word im listening yeah
sometimes problems seem too deep to take too hard to take
sometimes i cry thinking my future looks so bleak
bridge
finally together we were destined
i know whats best for us in the end
someone hear me someone stop me
someone listen why arent you listening
