i lie here paralytic
inside this soul
screaming for you till my throat is numb
i wanna break out i need a way out
i dont believe that its gotta be this way
the worst is the waiting
in this womb im suffocating

feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
i take you in
ive died

chorus

i want to live for love wanna live for you and me
breathe for the first time now
i come alive somehow
rebirthing now
i want to live my life wanna give you everything
breathe for the first time now
i come alive somehow
right now
