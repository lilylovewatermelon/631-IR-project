i know what youre thinking
its all got to go
at times driven along by the meaning
i need colours around me to fade

chorus
everything falls into place
everything falls in to favour
everything falls into place
and then we all go mad
and throw it away
we all go mad and throw it away

verse 2
i see what youre doing
makes sense after all
my hearts telling me im not mistaken
it feels better than i can believe

chorus
everything falls into place into place
everything falls into favour again
everything falls into place
and then we all go mad
and throw it away all go mad
we all go mad and throw it away

chorus
everything falls into place into place
everything falls in to favour again
everything falls into place
and then we all go mad
and throw it away all go mad
we all go mad and throw it away

outro
we all go mad and we throw it away
i said we all go mad and we throw it away
we all go mad and we throw it away
i said we all go mad and we throw it away
we all go mad and we throw it away
i said we all go mad and we throw it away
we all go mad and we throw it away
i said we all go mad and we throw it awayembed"
