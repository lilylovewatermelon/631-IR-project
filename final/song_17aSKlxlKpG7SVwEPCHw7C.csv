verse 4
one day maybe someday ill be so out of touch
ill become a trumpet or a drum set in a sad orchestra
one day maybe someday in a world speeding up
its getting hard so very hard to keep up
one day maybe someday ill be so out of touch
ill become a trumpet or a drum set
in a sad orchestra
one day i wont know what to write
and i cant be eighteen my whole life
but im too fuckin young to feel so fuckin old
but ill try and ill try and ill try
but im not dead yet so i guess ill be alright
outro
bang bang bang
but im way less sad
adventure is out there
but you gotta be some—
come on guy
bang bang bang
but its all i have
oh im not dead yet so i guess ill be alright21embed"
