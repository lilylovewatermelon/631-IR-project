my stupid mouth
has got me in trouble
i said too much again
to a date over dinner yesterday
and i could see
she was offended
she said well anyway
just dying for a subject change

bridge
oh another social casualty
score one more for me
how could i forget
mama said think before speaking
no filter in my head
oh whats a boy to do
i guess he better find one soon

verse 2
we bit our lips she looked out the window
rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
i played a quick game of chess
with the salt and pepper shaker
and i could see clearly
an indelible line was drawn
between what was good
what just slipped out and what went wrong
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likebridge
oh the way she feels about me has changed
thanks for playing try again
how could i forget
mama said think before speaking
no filter in my head
oh whats a boy to do
i guess he better find one

chorus
im never speaking up again
it only hurts me
id rather be a mystery
than she desert me
oh im never speaking up again
starting now

verse 3
one more thing why is it my fault
so maybe i try too hard
but its all because of this desire
i just want to be liked
just want to be funny
looks like the jokes on me
so call me captain backfire
chorus
im never speaking up again
it only hurts me
id rather be a mystery
than she desert me
oh im never speaking up again
im never speaking up again
im never speaking up again
starting now
starting now3embed"
