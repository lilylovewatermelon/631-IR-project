verse 2 snoop dogg
i had three on my right arm and four on my left
lime green and gold we was sharp to death ooh wee
had to catch my breath watch my step
playin this game you can holla at the ref
and call a timeout before you put your dime out
stop pause rewind before you put your rhyme out
and go to the wizard of oz
and tell em that your tryin to get yourself a brand new heart
a brand new start
cause you realized that you hadnt played your part
and that was smart
its like a art the way i articulate
and break these bitches from state to state
see ive been the flyest since i came out the gate
i aint ask for it homie i just shake and bake
i wont fake to make you buy my tape
i say a prayer to the lord just to keep my faith up straight
