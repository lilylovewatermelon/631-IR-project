blackandwhite film camera
yellow sunglasses
ash tray swimming pool
hot wax jump off the roof

chorus
a small concern with how the engine sounds
we held darkness in withheld clouds
i would ask should we just keep driving

verse 2
maple syrup coffee
pancakes for two
hash brown egg yolk
i will always love you

chorus
a small concern with how the engine sounds
we held darkness in withheld clouds
i would ask should we just keep driving
should we just keep driving

bridge
passports in foot wells
kiss her and dont tells
wine glass puff pass
tea with cyborgs
riot america
science and edibles
life hacks going viral in the bathroom
cocaine side boob
choke her with a sea view
toothache bad move
just act normal
moka pot monday
its all good
hey you

should we just keep driving
should we just keep driving
ooh should we just keep driving23embed"
