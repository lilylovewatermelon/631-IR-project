folks they try to tell me dont let your ship capsize dont let life pass you by
the world reality is the rat race where only the strong survive
its a dog eat dog world
wake up world
wake up world
wake up world
wake up world
wake up world
wake up world
give peace a chance
are you afraid
time is running out
give peace a chance
are you afraid
time is running out
