she’s a steel thriller suicide they say
cyanide in her plastic veins
she’s a mannequin of misery
she’s on a bender but she ain’t gonna break hey hey
tastes like sugar but it’s novocaine
she’s grinding teeth so she can sharpen the pain

black lips pale eyes
cyanide sweet tooth suicide
she’s a killer she’s my
cyanide sweet tooth suicide

verse 2
strychnine cerebellum feeds the brain
hurricane in a violent rage they say
she’s a looker just like anna nicole oh no
fuck the silver let’s go straight for the gold hey hey
digging deeper than a sixfoot hole
she’s snorting cocaine through a suicide note
