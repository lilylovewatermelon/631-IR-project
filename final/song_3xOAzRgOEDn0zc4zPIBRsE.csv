the first time i saw you
you were chasing down
a cyclone
all alone in a field
with rail yards and clovers
i kept rolling on and never thought
youd wind up chasing me

chorus 1
settle down i wont hesitate
to hit the highway
before you lay me to waste
saddle up and ill help you find
something to drive
before you drive me insane

verse 2
youre tired of walking and you
loathe the ground
the sidewalk will barely touch your feet
and life moves too slowly to hold you down
with wringing hands
you take it out on me

chorus 1
settle down i wont hesitate
to hit the highway
before you lay me to waste
saddle up and ill help you find
something to drive
before you drive me insane

so get yourself a car
and drive it all alone
get yourself a car
and ride it on the wind

chorus 2
get yourself a car
and drive it all alone
get yourself a car
and ride it on the wind

chorus 1
settle down i wont hesitate
to hit the highway
before you lay me to waste
saddle up and ill help you find
something to drive
before you drive me insane

chorus 2
so get yourself a car
and drive it all alone
get yourself a car
and ride it on the wind6embed"
