pardon me for my lack of excitement
but im not entirely thrilled
ssstutter when i talk flail around as i walk
yeah the moments been killed
and im not good at this no not at all
im not good at this

verse 2
im a wreck and i know it
and i tend to show it every chance that i get
butterflies in the skies they just fly on by
yeah theyre making me sick
they dont flutter about id do without
all they do is kick

chorus
mean it truly
sincere heart
why do you do this to me
tear me apart

verse 3
its my fault and i know it
and i tend to blow it no thanks to you
its like you sit and you watch me you poke and you taunt me
its all that you do
and im not fighting that no not at all
just want to be something a name you call
the lips you taste just to fall madly in love

mean it truly
sincere heart
why do you do this to me
tear me apart

bridge
ive got my eyes set on you
my heart is burning red
all of my words come out wrong
run circles in my head
you had me and i melted
in the palm of your hand
you know it yes i felt it
youll never understand

chorus
mean it truly
sincere heart
why do you do this to me
tear me apart
mean it truly
sincere heart
why do you do this to me
tear me apart1embed"
