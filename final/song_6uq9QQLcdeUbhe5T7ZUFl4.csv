i know they wanna come and separate us
but they cant do us nothin
youre the one i want and ima continue lovin
cause youre considered wife and im considered husband
and ima always be there for you
and either way you look at it i aint goin nowhere from my muffin
cause she gonna hold it down cant nobody tell her nothin
that got the kind of love that always make a better fussin
and thats what gets me closer to you

prechorus
and no one know why im into you
cause youll never know what its like to walk in our shoes
and no one know the things weve been through
can never measure up to half of what i put you through
thats why well break through

chorus
and i dont care what they say im gonna be with you
im gonna be with you i wanna be with you
and i dont care what they do im gonna be with you
im gonna be with you im gonna be with you

verse 2
seems like every day that go by things are gettin harder
wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
cause i know what my baby like i lean you on that prada
you aint got to match with the shoes
all about knowin you im into doin things to keep her longer
stickin together forever watch you grow stronger
thats the way it has to be everythin proper
keepin it always true
