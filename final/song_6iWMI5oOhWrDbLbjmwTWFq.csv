flashing lights
and we took a wrong turn
and we fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
cause nothings as it seems
and spinning out of control
prechorus
didnt they tell us dont rush into things
didnt you flash your green eyes at me
havent you heard what becomes of curious minds
ooh didnt it all seem new and exciting
i felt your arms twistin around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night

chorus
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever eh eh
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better eh eh

postchorus

in wonderland

so we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed
but there were strangers watchin
and whispers turned to talkin
and talking turned to screams oh

prechorus
didnt they tell us dont rush into things
didnt you flash your green eyes at me
didnt you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile
ooh didnt it all seem new and exciting
i felt your arms twistin around me
its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
but darling

chorus
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever eh eh
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better eh eh

i reached for you but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for somethin else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end in wonderland we both went mad
oh
