if you dont take me to paris
on a lovers getaway
its all right
its all right
if id rather wear your tshirt
than a sexy negligee
its all right
its all right
every dinner doesnt have to be candlelit
its kinda nice to know that it doesnt have to be

chorus
perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesnt always fit
perfectly
love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
but honey if its good enough for you
its good enough for me

verse 2
if your mother doesnt like
the way i treat her baby boy
its all right
its all right
if in every wedding picture
my daddy looks annoyed
its all right
its all right
dont you know that fairy tales tell a lie
real love and real life doesnt have to be

perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesnt always fit
perfectly
love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
but honey if its good enough for you
its good enough for me

bridge
you dont mind if i show up late for everything
and when you lose your cool its kinda cute to me
aint it nice to know that we dont have to be

chorus
perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesnt always fit
perfectly
love can be rough around the edges
tattered at the seams
but honey if its good enough for you
its good enough for me
