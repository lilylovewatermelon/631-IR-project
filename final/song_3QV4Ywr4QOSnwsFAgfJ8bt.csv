you think youre gonna take her away

its gonna tell her what to do
she might need a lot of loving
but she dont need you

you want me to think that im being used
you want her to think its over
you cant see it doesnt matter what you do
buddy you dont even know her

chorus
shes gonna listen to her heart
its gonna tell her what to do
she might need a lot of loving
but she dont need you
