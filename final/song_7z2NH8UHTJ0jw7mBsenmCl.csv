of how angels are supposed to be
theres an aura a kind of emanating light
suggesting perfection that may very well be true
but they cant hold a halo to you

their role as protector is what god made them for
and i take comfort in knowing theyre around
i dont mean to sound ungrateful or diminish what they do
but they cant hold a halo to you

by their very nature they must be heaven sent
here to work their miracles to wonder and to bless

i pray the lord forgive me cause when you touched me
thats when i knew
that they cant hold a halo to you

i pray the lord forgive me cause when you touched me
thats when i knew
that they cant hold a halo to youooh
