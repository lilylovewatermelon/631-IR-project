all white linen
riding till the sun comes down
see that we living like woahohoh

hook x2 robin thicke
this is like riding through the city
with the ocean in the background
this is like flying in paris
what your girl say now
party down

verse 1 tyga
bside baby parler
waterfront top back coupe with a fade
tonight is ours paper city red ruby
you looking fine as beautiful as one could ever be
tires spinning fast cars fast women
and i just wanna get a night with a happy ending
the yacht life hear the splash so much class
lift your glass make a toast we around the map
his and hers hermès bags leather tag
all real love she aint fucking with a scrub
chillin on top get away just a flight
living life this is what its like
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likehook

verse 2 tyga
shes so relentless body of a goddess
gotta take her higher
rain through my window pane she the fire to my flame
good aim put your heart where the sky is
its cold down there but its lonely up here
the worlds so cold you gon need a moncler
dont mind stare when i look at you its all clear
tryna keep it together and ball like ross dean
4seas car clean harleys
im from the goldera my jewels is gili
a party aint a party if it aint all night
living life this is what it’s like

hook x2 robin thicke

bridge robin thicke
like dolphin like you’ve never seen before
yea this is like a penthouse served at the top floor
this is like love that you can never get
and nobody can woahohoh
this is like woah…
this is like woah…
this is like woah…
this is like…
verse 3 tyga
all john blaze collar shirts school days
on stage a hundred thou two days
looking down on top from where the stars stay
reservoir and back guards in the entry way
i’m young and wild and i charm our old mother
invited your young daughter i’m known across waters
horses in the stable ferrari ‘cause i’m able
whole life i’ve been waiting

hook x2 robin thicke

outro robin thicke
this is like riding…
this is like flying…
this is like love…embed"
