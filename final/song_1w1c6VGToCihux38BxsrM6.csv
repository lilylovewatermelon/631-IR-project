last night i felt it burning through my mind
i just want to be your friend and i want you to know

chorus 1
in the light of a new day i left it all to you
in the night of confusion i loved you

verse 2
today i am stronger in so many ways
i just want to be there and i want you to see

chorus 2
in the light of a new day i left it all to you
im just looking for a way out and something else to do

bridge
i can feel it in my bones and i need it dont you see it
i am flying over the mountain do you feel it

outro
i wont be happy til youre out the door
you wont be happy til you get some more
you need me you love me
i wont be happy til youre out the door
you wont be happy til you get some more
cause you need me you love me
