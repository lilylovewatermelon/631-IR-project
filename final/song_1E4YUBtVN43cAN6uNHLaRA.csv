heres another pity
and theres another chance
try to learn a lesson but you cant
if we can burn a city
in futures and in past
without a change our lives will never last
were going fast

chorus
you can sit beside me when the world comes down
if it doesnt matter then just turn around
we dont need our bags and we can just leave town
you can sit beside me when the world comes down

verse 2
what can we do better
when will we know how
a man says from a sidewalk to a crowd
if we can change the weather
if you wanted it yourself
and if you cant i guess we all need help yeah
i need help

chorus
you can sit beside me when the world comes down
if it doesnt matter then just turn around
we dont need our bags and we can just leave town
you can sit beside me when the world comes down
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likebridge
we say and we do
all the lies the truth
and all i need is next to me
yeah were going fast

chorus
you can sit beside me when the world falls down
if it doesnt matter then just turn around
will you be the queen and ill be your clown
you can sit beside me when the world comes down
you can sit beside me when the world comes down1embed"
