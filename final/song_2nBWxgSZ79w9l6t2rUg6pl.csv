wrap me in a bolt of lightning
send me on my way still smiling
maybe thats the way i should go
straight into the mouth of the unknown
i left the spare key on the table
never really thought id be able
to say i merely visit on the weekends
i lost my whole life and a dear friend

prechorus
ive said it so many times
i would change my ways no never mind
god knows ive tried

chorus
call me a sinner call me a saint
tell me its over ill still love you the same
call me your favorite call me the worst
tell me its over i dont want you to hurt

postchorus
its all that i can say
so ill be on my way

verse 2
i finally put it all together
but nothin really lasts forever
i had to make a choice that was not mine
i had to say goodbye for the last time
i kept my whole life in a suitcase
never really stayed in one place
maybe thats the way it should be
you know i live my life like a gypsy
