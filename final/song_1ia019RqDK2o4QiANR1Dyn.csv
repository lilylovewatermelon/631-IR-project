i fly with the stars in the skies
i am no longer trying to survive
i believe that life is a prize
but to live doesnt mean youre alive
dont worry bout me and who i fire
i get what i desire its my empire
and yes i call the shots i am the umpire
i sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
in this very moment im king
in this very moment i slay goliath with a sling
this very moment i bring
put it on everything that i will retire with the ring
and i will retire with the crown yes
no im not lucky im blessed yes
clap for the heavyweight champ me
but i couldnt do it all alone we
young money raised me grew up out in baisley
southside jamaica queens and its crazy
cause im still hood hollywood couldnt change me
shout out to my haters sorry that you couldnt faze me
aint being cocky we just vindicated
best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
i dont know this night just remind me of
everything they deprived me of yeah

its a celebration every time we link up
we done did everything they can think of
greatness is what we on the brink of

this supposed to be yall year we aint get the memo
a young king pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he aint even roll
these niggas be droppin songs they aint even cold
weezy on top and that nigga aint even home yet

fuck it me and nicki nick gettin married today
and all you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet ooh
yeah you a star in my eyes
you and all them white girls party of five
are we drinking a lil more i can hardly decide
i cant believe we really made it im partly surprised i swear
damn this one for the books man
i swear this shit is as fun as it looks man
im really tryna make it more than what it is
cause everybody dies but not everybody lives ah
