the weather man says rain today
well saddle up and be on our way
whats a little rain to a high ridin rebel or two

chorus

easy loving you

verse 2
people keep searchin for a reason why
they say lifes a bitch and then youll die
but i cant see a reason for their point of view

chorus
cause its easy living
easy loving you

verse 3
talk shows talking how its near the end
of the oneman woman and the onewoman man
we might fight like dogs
but hey we love the making up at the end of the day
tomorrow that old sun will rise
ill be laying here by your side
a coffee cup and a good morning kiss or two
