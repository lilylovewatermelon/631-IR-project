little girl
you like it loud
come alive in the middle of a crowd
you wanna scream
you wanna shout
get excited when the lights go down

chorus 1
at the rock show
youll be right in the front row
heart and soul they both know
it’s where you gotta be

verse 2
little girl there you are
all the lighters looking just like stars
sing along feel the sound
take a ride on the hands of the crowd
and here it comes the moment when
you know you’ll never be the same again
power chord see the light
you found your place in the world tonight

chorus 2
at the rock show
youll be right in the front row
heart and soul they both know
its where you gotta be
yeah at the rock show
getting high on the solo
so what if it’s crazy
thats gonna be me
see halestorm liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likeverse 3
this goes out to anyone
whose heart beats like a kick drum
when a bitchin riff comes
knows the words to every line every time
and you know you gotta go get some get pumped
find yourself and lose it

chorus 3
at the rock show
im looking at the front row
heart and soul we both know
its where we gotta be
yeah at the rock show
were reaching for the high notes
so what if were crazy
youre coming with me
youre coming with me
youre coming with me
so what if it’s crazy
it’s where we gotta be
