sometimes i feel like cutting a vein just watching it bleed
im tired of laying it down getting nothing on the other end
and people only wanting to be your friend when you got something they need
chorus 
well now some days ya kill it
and some days you just choke
some days you just blast off
and some days you just smoke
well now maybe i do and maybe i dont
everybody says theyll be there
but in the end yall know they wont

well im getting pretty tired of being treated like competition
when the only one that can hold me down is inside my head
whats a honky gotta do around here to get a little recognition
start to think i might be worth more to everybody if i was dead

chorus

im getting pretty tired sitting around and wasting time
im tired of taking blame when i aint done nothing wrong
im tired of other people trying to take whats mine
and im tired of yall playing dress up and trying to sing them old country songs

well some days you kill it and some days you just choke
some days you blast off and some days you just smoke
well now maybe i do and maybe i dont
everybody says theyll be there but in the end yall know they wontyou might also like1embed"
