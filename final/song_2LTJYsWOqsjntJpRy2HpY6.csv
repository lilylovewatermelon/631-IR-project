drum dummie
kimj with the heat

chorus
on the road halfway home
sorry my friend i dont wanna be alone again
so i ill be gone til november go on and mark your calendar
phone keep ringing heart keep breaking

verse
uh no matter what i do cant keep nobody happy
cant keep these haters off me cant get along with my daddy
i hope when they get older that my kids can understand me
all i ever wanted with they mama was a family
cause all i ever felt growing up was abandoned
pops went up the river left a nigga out hеre stranded
but as i grew wisеr i could finally understand it
it seems since a teen i been on my own planet
lord knows i love my mama but i hate she think im crazy
then got out here on my own got in this world and made it
all the shit that we been through you would think that i hate ya
still put on my super suit came back to you and saved us
i was lost as a teen cant believe that i made it out
cant believe i got everything that i prayed about
and i knew for a minute whats too good to be true
all the shit i took you through girl i apologize to you
