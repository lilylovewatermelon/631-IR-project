pigs they tend to wiggle when they walk
the infrastructure rots
and the owners hate the jocks
with their agents and their dates
if the signatures are checked
youll just have to wait
and were counting up the instants that we save
tired nation so depraved
from the cheap seats see us
wave to the camera
it took a giant ramrod
to raze the demon settlement

prechorus
but highho silver ride
highho silver ride
take another ride to see me home

chorus
listen to me
im on the stereo stereo
oh my baby baby baby baby babe
gave me malaria hysteria

verse 2
what about the voice of geddy lee
how did it get so high
i wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy
i know him and he does
and youre my factcheckin cuz aww

well focus on the quasar in the mist
the kaiser has a cyst
and im a blank want list
the qualms you have and if they stick
they will drown you in a crick
in the neck of a woods
that was populated by
tired nation on the fly
everybody knows advice
that was given out for free
lots of details to discern
lots of details

prechorus
but highho silver ride
highho silver ride
takes another ride to make me

chorus
oh get off the air
im on the stereo stereo
my baby baby baby baby baby babe
gave me malaria hysteria1embed"
