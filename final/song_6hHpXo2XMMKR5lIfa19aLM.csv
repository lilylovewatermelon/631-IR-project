no time for goodbye he said
as he faded away
dont put your life in someones hands
theyre bound to steal it away
dont hide your mistakes
cause theyll find you burn you
then he said

if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life
if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life

this is my last time she said
as she faded away

but one day youll end up like me

if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life
if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life
if you wanna get out alive if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life
if you wanna get out alive if you wanna get out alive
oh run for your life
