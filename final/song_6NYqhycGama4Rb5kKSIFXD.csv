i can keep on changing the song
keep on changing stations
til i finally land on one
i dont mind that they keep playing
id take a different road through town
i find another way around
change it up really shake it up
yeah im trying

chorus
but it dont change gone wont bring her back
shes moved on and im stuck with that
i could change whatever i want
but it dont change gone

verse 2
i can keep on hanging around
but i dont see me staying
strike a match and burn it down
walk out and leave it laying
dont think about a thing just drive
far enough til i find a change of scene
a new routine id try anything

chorus
but it dont change gone wont bring her back
shes moved on and im stuck with that
i could change whatever i want
but it dont change

yeah i could change whatever i want
but it dont change gone
