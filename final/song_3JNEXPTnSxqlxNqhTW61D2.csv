its another if it aint one thing
instigators like putting fire on propane
the wrong thing they be worrying about
ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

prechorus

like you you like you
misery misery loves company
dont let em change your mood

behind your back your back your back your back
they tryna tell me that im just like the others
but i aint all bad

verse 2
