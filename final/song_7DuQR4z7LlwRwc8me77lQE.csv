she says she loves me but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts its like another papercut
and im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
claims she loves me but she cuts me into pieces
when im sewed up here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

verse one
we met twentytwo years back fresh out the womb
now she consumes me no room for self these days
and shes so demandin  do this do that
dont forget to take your medicine
i hate it when her face is invading my head again
the welcome mat reads please take off your shoes
but she disregards the statement
ive grown accustomed to bending my beliefs
to satisfy her needs but im fed up
with plugging cuts everytime they bleed
so i dip my pen in the puddle
what a bloody mess its been tryin to end this struggle
but i love her shes the reason for the lesions
man i love her i start bleeding when shes leavin
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
all the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her but
ill sit alone til she comes back home
and ill be waitin by the phone ring hello

she says she loves me but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts its like another papercut
and im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
claims she loves me but she cuts me into pieces
when im sewed up here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

interlude
she dont live here no more i heard shes stayin down the street
with a deadbeat that dont treat her right with two badass kids
guilt and regret and im willin to bet
my last album that shes wishin she was kissin me

verse two
man the nerve of this bitch pardon my french but its been 10 days
and im gettin kind of lightheaded
maybe ill write her a letter in a gentlemans way
and send it with the hopes that she might get it
i cant believe i let her run all over me
but all i think about is when shes here and holdin me
i love her shes the reason for the lesions
man i love her i start bleeding when shes leavin
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
all the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her and
i cant complain i kind of like the pain
she aint even got a name she just lives in my brain and
hook
she says she loves me but she comes and goes when she pleases

when im sewed up here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

outro
says she loves me but she really thinks that im an asshlole
she says she loves me but my ears are too big
she says she loves me but i pick my nose too much
she says she loves me but she says i never really listen
she says she loves me but i take too many pills
she says she loves me but i never pay my bills
she says she loves me but i wait until the last minute
she says she loves me but i dont try hard enough1embed"
