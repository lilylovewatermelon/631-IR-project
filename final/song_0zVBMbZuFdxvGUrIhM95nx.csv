a feather floats through the air the falling feather

a city savannah is revealed in the background the feather
floats down toward the city below the feather drops down
toward the street below as people walk past and cars drive
by and nearly lands on a mans shoulder

he walks across the street causing the feather to be whisked
back on its journey the feather floats above a stopped car
the car drives off right as the feather floats down toward
the street

the feather floats under a passing car then is sent flying
back up in the air a man sits on a bus bench the feather
floats above the ground and finally lands on the mans
mudsoaked shoe

the man reached down and picks up the feather his name is
forrest gump he looks at the feather oddly moves aside a
box of chocolates from an old suitcase then opens the case

inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes a
pingpong paddle toothpaste and other personal items
forrest pulls out a book titled curious george then places
the feather inside the book forrest closes the suitcase

something in his eyes reveals that forrest may not be all
there

forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard

a bus pulls up forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus
continues on

a black woman in a nurses outfit steps up and sits down at
the bus bench next to forrest the nurse begins to read a
magazine as forrest looks at her

forrest
hello my names forrest gump

he opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse

forrest
you want a chocolate

the nurse shakes her head a bit apprehensive about this
strange man next to her
forrest
i could eat about a million and a
half of these my momma always said
life was like a box of chocolates
you never know what youre gonna
get

forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurses
shoes

forrest
those must be comfortable shoes
ill bet you could walk all day in
shoes like that and not feel a thing
i wish i had shoes like that

black woman
my feet hurt

forrest
momma always says theres an awful
lot you could tell about a person by
their shoes where theyre going
where theyve been

the black woman stares at forrest as he looks down at his
own shoes
forrest
ive worn lots of shoes i bet if i
think about it real hard i could
remember my first pair of shoes

forrest closes his eyes tightly

forrest

sheet over his head

the general is in full ku klux klan garb including his horse

the general rides off followed by a large group of klan
members dressed in full uniform

she said we was related to him in
some way and what he did was he
started up this club called the ku

bedsheets on their horses and ride
around and anyway thats how i got

i dont know anything about that
but

forrest and his followers job through a small town a man
runs up and talks to forrest

forrest vo
some of those people asked me if i
could help them out

aging hippie
hey man hey listen i was wondering
if you might help me huh listen
im in the bumper sticker business
and ive been trying to think up a
good slogan and since you have been
such a big inspiration to the people
around here i thought you might be
able to help me jump into whoa
man you just ran through a big pile
of dogshit

the hippie jumps over the dogshit as he runs along forrest

forrest
it happens

aging hippie
what shit

forrest
sometimes

the hippie stops to ponder this profound thought

forrest vo
and some years later i heard that
fella did come up with a bumper
sticker slogan

a bumper sticker reads shit happens

forrest vo
and he make a lot of money off of
it

the truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection

it collides with a car

ext truck stop

forrest runs followed by his group as a man runs up to
him

forrest vo
another time i was running along
somebody who had lost all his money
in the tshirt business and he wanted
to put my face on a tshirt but he
couldnt draw that well and he didnt
have a camera

wildeyed man
i think it would be really fortunate
for me if i could get your name on
these oh your face and name on
these tshirts it would be wonderful

a truck splashes mud onto forrest as it goes by the man
hands forrest a yellow tshirt to use as a rag to wipe the
mud off

wildeyed man
here use this one nobody likes
that color anyway

forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the
man

forrest
have a nice day

the man looks at the tshirt he holds it up displaying the
happy face

forrest vo
and some years later i found out
that that man did come up with a
idea for a tshirt and he made a lot
of money off of it

ext monument valley

forrest runs with a group that follows behind him

forrest vo
anyway like i was saying i had a
lot of company my momma always said
you got to put the past behind you
before you can move on and i think
