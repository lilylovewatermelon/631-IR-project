yeahhhhh
how many times have i told you love you
dont seem to change a thang girl youre not the same
there was a time when you wanted me to hug you
and treat you like the lady that you wanna be
the girl i knew that wanted me
would never try to hold me back
and do me all this wrong
girl whats goin on
i tried to talk and you walk away
right out of my face right out of my place but

chorus
thats just it girl
you just dont know how much i love you now
that you walked out of my house
thats just it girl
itll be another day be another way
to get you right back in my place
thats just it girl
you just dont know how much i love you now
that you walked out of my house
thats just it girl
itll be another day be another way
to get you right back in my place

how many times have we sat at a table
and both ate at one time and said whats on our mind
im thinkin our relationship was a fable
a fairytale to me thats just how it seems oh girl i heard
even when i heard that you was cheatin i was faithful
and would do any god damn thing that you would say too
i tried to talk and you walk away
right out of my face right out of my place but

chorus
thats just it girl
you just dont know how much i love you now
that you walked out of my house
thats just it girl
itll be another day be another way
to get you right back in my place
thats just it girl
you just dont know how much i love you now
that you walked out of my house
thats just it girl
itll be another day be another way
to get you right back in my place

to get you right back in my place
