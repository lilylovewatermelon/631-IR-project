verse 1
sick of trying to find a way inside
sick and tired of all the after
sick of trying to find a way to slide
even though it always ends in laughter
its never hard to tell when things are done
she looked into my eyes and a voice said run
she says that im a mess but its alright
whether its two weeks two years or just tonight

chorus
you can occupy my every sigh
you can rent the space inside my mind
at least until the price becomes too high

verse 2
i can find a reason that we should quit
i can find a reason to do it
i can find excuses for all my shit
she tells me just to work right through it
shes pretty and i like her but shes too well
cause i need red flags and long nights and she can tell
its not that its my fault its just my style
beginning with a look and then a smile
you might also likechorus
you can occupy my every sigh
you can rent the space inside my mind
at least until the price becomes too high
you can occupy my every sigh
you can rent the space inside my mind
at least until the price becomes too high

bridge
she dont need a thing she dont need saving or a lay
shes got all her friends around and you can hear them say
hes not into you hes into the idea of
but little do they know that shes not through

chorus
you can occupy my every sigh
you can rent the space inside my mind
at least until the price becomes too high
you can occupy my every sigh
you can rent the space inside my mind
at least until the price becomes too high5embed"
