all this time i was wastin hopin you would come around
ive been givin out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and its taken me this long baby but ive figured you out
and youre thinkin well be fine again but not this time around

chorus
you dont have to call anymore
i wont pick up the phone
this is the last straw
dont wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that youre sorry
but i dont believe you baby like i did before
youre not sorry
no no no no

verse 2
youre lookin so innocent i might believe you if i didnt know
couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt lеft me waitin in the cold
and youve got your sharе of secrets and im tired of bein last to know oh
and now youre askin me to listen cause its worked each time before

chorus
but you dont have to call anymore
i wont pick up the phone
this is the last straw
dont wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that youre sorry
but i dont believe you baby like i did before
youre not sorry
no no
youre not sorry
no no
