the unknown distance to the great beyond
stares back at my grieving frame
to cast my shadow by the holy sun
my spirit moans with a sacred pain
and its quiet now
the universe is standing still

chorus
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now

verse 2
and all that stands between the souls release
this temporary flesh and bone
we know that its over now
i feel my faded mind begin to roam
every time you fall
and every time you try
every foolish dream
and every compromise
every word you spoke
and everything you said
everything you left me rambles in my head
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now
up above the world so high

verse 3
and everything you loved
and every time you try
everybodys watching
everybody cry
stay dont leave me
the stars can wait for your sign
dont signal now

chorus
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now
theres nothing i can say
theres nothing we can do now

outro
goodnight travel well
goodnight travel well
and theres nothing i can say
theres nothing i can do now

goodnight travel well
