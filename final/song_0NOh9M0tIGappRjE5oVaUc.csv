the monster shattered the day
in a place where innocents play
i was mourning as the headlines shouted his name
they didnt waste any time
i was disgusted when the madmans image appeared at the top of the screen
some were barely alive
too many didnt survive
still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name
do they not realize
the future demons with the hope of becoming the one at the top of the screen

prechorus
theyve thrown morality away
with such depravity i must say

chorus 1
you made sure the world will remember the name
but didnt the thought even enter your mind
youd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life

verse 2
the pictures drove me insane
cant get them out of my brain
you made certain they were right at the top of the page
you disrespected the dead
when the only name was of the one who committed the murder at the top of the page
the madman watching with glee
as the herd of innocents flee
they saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen
perhaps they could be the one
whod become famous for the acts of terror reflected on the face of the screen

with such depravity i must say

chorus 2
you made sure the world will remember the name
but didnt the thought even enter your mind
youd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
and i call you a pimp as you whore the insane
the damage you caused you cannot rectify
youve inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life

bridge
take a look around
listen to the sound
feel it on the ground
fear has come in a wave
just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
listen to me now
are you with me now
can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
lets defy them
take a look around
listen to the sound
feel it on the ground
fear has come in a wave
just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
listen to me now
are you with me now
can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
lets defy them
