now when you say you wanna slow down
does it mean you wanna slow dance
maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
on our romance
what do you mean i got it backwards
you know were gonna be forever
why are you telling me goodbye
arent you gonna stay the night

chorus
are we really over now
maybe i can change your mind
soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times

verse 2
now i walk under a pink sky ooh
lovers float along and pass me by
i pour my heart out to your voice mail
let you know i caught a bus to your side of town
and now im standing at your doorstep
with los angeles behind me
if you dont answer ill just use the key that i copied
cause i really need to see you
see paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also likeprechorus
if youre not here when i break in
im gonna go through your closet
just so i can smell your skin
as the chemicals swim
i know ill never love again
i swear ill never love again

chorus
baby are we over now
maybe i can change your mind
as soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times
