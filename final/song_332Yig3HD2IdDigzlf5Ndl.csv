outro tyler the creator
im tryna find a place a place where i can land at
a place where i can be with no alphabet
dictating where to stand at
you can buy a car you can buy many things
you can buy happiness but you cant buy wings
you can buy a parachute you can buy a parrot
but you cant buy a pair of wings aerodynamic
to stay cloud level
thats why im in first class but i feel like coach fucked up
cause im in first class but i feel like coach
its just crazy how you can have everything in the world but
you in first class but you feel like coach damn
