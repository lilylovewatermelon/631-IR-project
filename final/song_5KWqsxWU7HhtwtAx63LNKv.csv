it feels like something got in the way
and maybe i had something to do with it
theres not much that i can say
but there sure is something ive got to prove to you
i told you that id try
and you said that i lie
like i have something to sell

hook 1
come on wait a minute
you think ive been in this
for a little while
but now come on baby please
ive been on my knees for a long time
so come on give it to me
just give it to me

verse 2
theres always something i wanna say
but the words wont never come out
the way i want
maybe i see another way
or maybe i just see something you dont
these stories that you tell
now i know them a little too well
you think ill take what i want
oh no
