one two three four

verse
darkhaired girl too much jack daniels
ill be honest right now im too drunk to handle
dark brown eyes and a neck tattoo
i am next to you but im a thousand miles away
wildflowers picked on a hillside you just let die
thats where i learned decay
people come then they stay and they go
someone please let me know when growing up grew so old

chorus
cause the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to be
thеres a cigarette rolling through thе tips of clenched teeth
i dont need much just somewhere to sleep
someone please remind me who the hell i used to be
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to sleep
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to be

instrumental break

verse 2
darkhaired girl summer time crop top
in a 89 drop top rolling eyes at me
is it love is it lust or leavin
am i awake or dreamin the woman i need
wildflowers and a neck tattoo
i am next to you and i aint ever gonna stay
i remember a time i was sober
but those days are over i need a beer to celebrate
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
cause the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to be
theres a cigarette rolling through the tips of my teeth
i dont need much just somewhere to sleep
someone please remind me who the hell i used to be
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to sleep
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to be

instrumental break

chorus
cause the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to sleep
theres a cigarette rolling through the tips of my teeth
i dont need much just somewhere to sleep
someone please remind me who the hell i used to be
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to sleep
the sober side of sorry aint a safe place to be
