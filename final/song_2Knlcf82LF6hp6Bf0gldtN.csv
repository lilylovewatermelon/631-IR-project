im writing you to catch you up on places ive been
and you held this letter
probably got excited but theres nothing else inside it

prechorus
didnt have a camera by my side this time
hoping i would see the world through both my eyes
maybe i will tell you all about it when
im in the mood to lose my way with words

verse 2
today skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
and strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
are next to mountains anyway

prechorus
didnt have a camera by my side this time
hoping i would see the world through both my eyes
maybe i will tell you all about it when
im in the mood to lose my way with words

chorus
but let me say
you should have seen that sunrise
with your own eyes
it brought me back to life
youll be with me next time i go outside
just no more 3x5s
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likebridge
i guess you had to be there
guess you had to be with me

verse 3
today i finally overcame
trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
maybe i will tell you all about it when
im in the mood to lose my way
but let me say

chorus
but let me say
you should have seen that sunrise
with your own eyes
it brought me back to life
youll be with me next time i go outside
just no more 3x5s4embed"
