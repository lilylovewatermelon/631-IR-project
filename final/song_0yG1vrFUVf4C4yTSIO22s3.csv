there is a price that we all must pay
im really sorry for the mess that i have made
so can you tell me what will you do
when everything youve known turns right around on you

prechorus
ive been through a hell of a lot
you let them nail me to your cross
no matter who what where or when
ive always went down for all your sins

chorus
my daddy told me not to bite my tongue
i hate my momma cause she left me with no love
bottle it up and sweep it under the rug hate my mother
if all the good things gotta come to an end
then were living in a world where the evil wins
im obviously pessimistic cynical hypocritic mess yeah

bridge
never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life when everything around me has failed
who knows what the future brings but eventually the truth will prevail
in moments like these when you really gotta think about the broken dreams that you sell
tick tock in your head it goes where it stops who knows like a carousel
never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life when everything around me has failed
who knows what the future brings but eventually the truth will prevail
in moments like these when you really gotta think about the broken dreams that you sell
tick tock in your head it goes where it stops who knows like a carousel
