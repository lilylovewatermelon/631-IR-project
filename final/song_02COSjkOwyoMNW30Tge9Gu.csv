wake up the house is on fire
and the cats caught in the dryer
philosophys a liar when your home is your headstone
icon is the last chance for hope
when theres no such thing as heroes
your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in

prechorus
last chance to piss it all away
nothin but hell to pay when the lights are going down

chorus
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
celebrate your own decay
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
on a noose over your home
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
get on your knees and pray
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
but at least youre not alone

verse 2
christmas lights in the middle of august
grudges come back to haunt us
your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
grounded in a duplex to find
that youre livin on a landmine
vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeprechorus
last chance to piss it all away
nothin but hell to pay when the lights are going down

chorus
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
celebrate your own decay
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
on a noose over your home
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
get on your knees and pray
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
but at least youre not alone

prechorus
last chance to piss it all away
nothin but hell to pay when all you wanna do
na do give up give up

chorus
deadbeat holiday
celebrate your own decay
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
on a noose over your home
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
get on your knees and pray
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
but at least youre not alone
ohohoh deadbeat holiday
celebrate your own decay
theres a vacant sign thats hangin high
