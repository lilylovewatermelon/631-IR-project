intro nicki minaj
you might think youve peeped the scene
you havent the real ones far too mean
the watereddown one the one you know
was made up centuries ago
they made it sound all wack and corny
yes its awful blasted boring
twisted fictions sick addiction
well gather round children zip it listen
chorus justin vernon  teyana taylor

can we get much higher so high
oh oh oh
oh oh ohoh oh oh

yeah yeah yeah yeah
i fantasized bout this back in chicago
mercy mercy me that murciélago
thats me the first year that i blow
how you say broke in spanish mi no hablo
me drown sorrow in that diablo
me found bravery in my bravado
djs need to listen to the models
you aint got no fuckin yeezy in your serato you aint got no yeezy nigga
stupid but what the hell do i know
im just a chitown nigga with a nas flow
and my chick in that new phoebe philo
so much head i woke up to sleepy hollow
chorus justin vernon  teyana taylor
can we get much higher
oh oh oh
oh oh ohoh oh

verse 2 kanye west
look like a fat booty celine dion
sex is on fire im the king of leona lewis
beyond the truest
hey teacher teacher tell me how do you respond to students
and refresh the page and restart the memory
respark the soul and rebuild the energy
we stopped the ignorance we killed the enemy
sorry for the night demons that still visit me
the plan was to drink until the pain over
but whats worse the pain or the hangover
fresh air rollin down the window
too many urkels on your team thats why your wins low
dont make me pull the toys out huh
dont make me pull the toys
and fire up the engines huh
and then they make noise
chorus justin vernon  teyana taylor
can we get much higher so high
oh oh oh
oh oh ohoh oh
bridge justin vernon  kanye west
at the mall there was a seance
just kids no parents
then the sky filled with herons
saw the devil in a chrysler lebaron
and the hell it wouldnt spare us
and the fires did declare us
but after that took pills kissed an heiress
and woke up back in paris
chorus justin vernon  teyana taylor
can we get much higher so high
oh oh oh
oh oh ohoh oh oh
