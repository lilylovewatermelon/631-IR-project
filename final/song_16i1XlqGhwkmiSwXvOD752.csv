i dont miss you at all
i hear children playin laughin so loud
i dont think of your smile

so if you never come to me
youll stay a distant memory
out my window i see lights going dark
your dark eyes dont haunt me

and then i wonder who i am
without the warm touch of your hand

and then i wonder who i am
without the warm touch of your hand
as i sit and watch the snow fallin down
i dont miss you at all
i dont miss you at all
i dont miss you at allsee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
