as he rests in his towers on high
makin us run after his pennies
most of our lives
ana there aint nothin we can do now
cause we all got to survive
sittin down here rottin from deep inside
im singin dream
jus dream for me
im singin dream
jus dream for me
im singin dream
jus dream for me
cause i believe
that these chains they are growin weak
yes i believe
that these chains they are growin weak
theyre growin weak
theyre growin weak

now i know that you can hear them screamin
from those cubicles deep inside
as they sit just now wonderin
always that question why
and i know you can hear them whisperin
why they cant get what they need
strapped down to the table
theyre injected with that greed
im singin dream
jus dream for me
im singin dream
jus dream for me
im singin dream
jus dream for me
im sayin dream
jus dream for me
cause i believe
that these chains they are growin weak
yes i believe
that these chains they are growin weak
theyre growin weak
theyre growin weakyou might also likeembed"
