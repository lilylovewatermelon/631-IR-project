trying not to lose my head but i have never been this scared before
tell you what ill do instead lay my body down on the floor
to forget what ive done silhouette til the good lord come

chorus
all we know is distance
were close and then we run
kiss away the difference
i know you hate this one

verse 2
trying not to lose your own
boxing up everything youve got
all you ever knew of home
youre scared scared to see your mother there in the door
you wonder where did the years go

chorus
all we know is distance
were close and then we run
kiss away the difference
i know you hate this one
but this is how the story ends
or have we just begun
to kiss away the difference
i know you hate this one
you might also likebridge
the violins make no sounds
and i begin to feel the ground

chorus
all we know is distance
were close and then we run
kiss away the difference
i know you hate this one
but this is where the story ends
or have we just begun
to kiss away the difference
i know you hate this one

outro
listens till hes twenty
lasts till twentyone
rushing past the window
like hes watching his own son
sixty years of sorrow
brought five or six of bliss
left my mothers mother
without so much as a kiss1embed"
