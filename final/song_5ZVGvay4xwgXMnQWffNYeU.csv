yeah im chillin on a dirt road
laid back swervin like im george jones
smoke rollin out the window
an ice cold beer sittin in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
its got me reminiscin on them good times
im turning off of real life drivin thats right
im hittin easy street on mud tires

verse 1
back in the day potts farm was the place to go
load the truck up hit the dirt road
jump the barbwire spread the word
light the bonfire then call the girls
the king in the can and the marlboro man
jack n jim were a few good men
where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
better watch out for the boys in blue
and all this small town he said she said
aint it funny how rumors spread
like i know something yall dont know
man that talk is getting old
ya better mind your business man watch your mouth
before i have to knock that loud mouth out
im tired of talkin man yall aint listening
them old dirt roads is what yall missing
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
yeah im chillin on a dirt road
laid back swervin like im george jones
smoke rollin out the window
an ice cold beer sittin in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
its got me reminiscin on them good times
im turning off of real life drivin thats right
im hittin easy street on mud tires

verse 2
i sit back and think about them good ol days
the way we were raised and our southern ways
and we like cornbread and biscuits
and if its broke round here we fix it
i can take yall where you need to go
down to my hood back in them woods
we do it different round here thats right
but we sure do it good and we do it all night
see if you really wanna know how it feels
to get off the road with trucks and four wheels
jump on in and man tell your friends
well raise some hell where the blacktop ends

chorus
chillin on a dirt road
laid back swervin like im george jones
smoke rollin out the window
an ice cold beer sittin in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
its got me reminiscin on them good times
im turning off of real life drivin thats right
im hittin easy street on mud tires
lets ride
yeah im chillin on a dirt road
laid back swervin like im george jones
smoke rollin out the window
an ice cold beer sittin in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
its got me reminiscin on them good times
im turning off of real life drivin thats right
im hittin easy street on mud tires
