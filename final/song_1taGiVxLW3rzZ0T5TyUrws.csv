verse 1 tech n9ne
hots what it is watch what the kid drops
ima get the prop if youre not with the biz
not only other regions i really popped at the crib
so hatin motherfuckers you better stop with the jibs
off of the thizz but im boss
it dont matter what the cost
when i live right across from the wiz
killa city will have a nigga lost in the mid
leavin nothin but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
what is happening is a merger different levels of murder
lil weezy cookin and im a server
further thats what ima get doing this
remember when eating gerber
mama said to kill em all and i heard her
thank you baby for what became lil wayne
hes gettin all the people knowin that strange in the game
i been really able to hang in the fame
but when he shouted my name its been a change in my lane
im a klusterfuk and lovin nothin but to get your brain
and i be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
and take a niggas dame with no shame
really be bussin up they thinkin they thuggin tough
but never do knuckle up you in the gang you bang
you drug and touchin every thang you lame
sucka you cannot sustain the reign
tech n9ne is such a cuckoo in this
ballin nigga strange music crew threw swishes
i know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
well you listenin to tecca nina soo woo bidness

today i feel electric gray i hope tomorrow neon black
i tell a nigga all those flows are borrowed
it’s the pharaoh three stacks
i woke up in cairo lookin’ at stars
so bright in the sky i thought they were marbles
no car doors whatcha call those
a whole carload of raw hoes
in a jeep defender
please remember don’t feed the simba
three’s assembled like nobody
hes a symbol of whats safari
pulled her ponytail to my body
she’s the only girl that was smart enough
to call me mr benjamin in the middle of a wild party
skin was cinnamon i pound it harder
how come the only girls that are thought of
are the light ones well tonight then
we gon’ do it do it do it for the dark ones
it’s important that you are more than
welcome to tha carter iv and
y’all enjoy it i will go ‘head
and i’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead out20embed"
