youre standing there with your cigarette
looking at me like weve never met
i know i fucked up so ill take the blame
and i dont expect you to let me explain
you cant forgive i cant forget
i know youre just too different now

chorus
but i miss you and that denim jacket
i let you get away i let you get away
do you still wear that denim jacket
i let you get away i let you get away
cause the color of that blue sky
just reminds me of our goodbye
do you still wear the denim jacket
i let you get away i let you get away

verse 2
now someone else is taking you home yeah
hands on the waist i used to hold
and i know its my fault
im late to the dance
cause you couldnt wait for me and i understand
why you never look back once that door closed
i know youre just too different now
