i just wanted to fall i said believe me
and when it hit me like a heart attack honestly
were not in love were never going to be
so why pretend baby cant you see
it wouldve been better if if we never theres no turning back for me
it wouldve been better i shouldve known better i dont want to believe

chorus
i dont want to talk and i dont want to sing stupid love songs stupid love
songs that i just cant believe in
i thought you were the one but i just cant believe
believe in love believe in love believe in love its just a lie

bridge
believe in love its just a lie
believe in love its just a lie

verse 2
im tripping on my strut so we can be in love
swallow what you sell so i can never tell
this is just a dream its never what it seems
a total spins around i can see it fallin down
it wouldve been better if if we never theres no turning back for me
it wouldve been better i shouldve known better i dont want to believe

bridge x4

verse 3
i thought i knew you but all i knew
was the girl i wanted you to turn into
i thought youd have my heart singing but oh no girl we were so wrong
baby baby let me tell you the truth any other guy would kill for you
i guess i just could fake it i wont believe in love its just a lie
