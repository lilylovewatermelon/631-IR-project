baby here i am again
kicking dust in the canyon wind
waiting for that sun to go down
made it up mulholland drive
hellbent on getting high
high above the lights of town

chorus
you and tequila make me crazy
run like poison in my blood
one more night could kill me baby
one is one too many one more is never enough

verse 2
thirty days and thirty nights
been putting up a real good fight
there were times i thought youd win
its so easy to forget
the bitter taste the morning left
swore i wouldnt go back there again

chorus
you and tequila make me crazy
run like poison in my blood
one more night could kill me baby
one is one too many one more is never enough
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
when it comes to you
oh the damage i could do
its always your favorite sins
that do you in

chorus
you and tequila make me crazy
run like poison in my blood
one more night could kill me baby
one is one too many one more is never enough

outro
never enough
you and tequila
you and tequila make me crazy1embed"
