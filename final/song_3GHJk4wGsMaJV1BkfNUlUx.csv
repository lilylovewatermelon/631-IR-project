oh oh oh oh oh oh
here we go

verse 1
we got problems we dont know how to solve them
everywhere we go we got some skeletons that follow
we got baggage you know were going to drag it
everywhere we go for everyone to see

chorus
and the broken hearts parade
and im putting my heart out on display
theres no masquerade
just a funeral march for love today

postchorus
the band strikes up and theyre playing our song
dressed in black and were singing along
to the broken hearts parade
and ive never been better then i am today
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

to the beating of a broken heartembed"
