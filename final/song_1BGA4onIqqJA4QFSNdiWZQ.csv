on my own two feet
against you girl
i just cant walk away

i said
i cant take it that easy
wanna break you down tonight
dont wanna waste another day

and its not over just yet

give me this
one last fighting chance
to crash the wall
ill get to you
you are a war
worth dying for
tonight

give me this
one last fighting chance
to be the kid
who caved you in
itd be so easy
to lose myself to you
you might also likequiet
i will be
so sure
calling your bluff
i think you lost
your will to fight

and you know
ill storm
through your castles doors
cause you know that im good for you
and youre scared of what youll find

a love you wont regret

give me this
one last fighting chance
to crash the wall
ill get to you
you are a war
worth dying for
tonight

give me this
one last fighting chance
to be the kid
who caved you in
itd be so easy
to lose myself to you
so open up
your friendly fire
and let me be
the kill youre missing
dont wanna see you
close your eyes
until this is over

give me this
one last fighting chance
to crash the wall
ill get to you
you are a war
worth dying for
tonight

give me this
one last fighting chance
to be the kid
who caved you in
itd be so easy
to lose myself to youembed"
