ooh silence is making me nostalgic
two sizes big your shirt in my apartment
oh we were kids but that dont make this less hard
if i could fly i doubt id even do it
id probably get high and crash or something stupid
you made ohio feel just like central park

prechorus
liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
and mines full of receipts

chorus
ooh this towns for the record now
the intersection got a target
and theyre calling it downtown
you and all of your new perspective now
wish i could shut it in a closet
and drag you back down

verse 2
gave me your word and now i cant pronounce it
no thing so sure that i cant learn to doubt it
now the state bird it sings our song so out of key
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeprechorus
liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
and mines full of receipts

chorus
ooh this towns for the record now
the intersection got a target
and theyre calling it downtown
you and all of your new perspective now
wish i could shut it in a closet
and drag you back down

bridge
and drag you back down

prechorus
liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
and mines full of receipts

chorus
ooh this towns for the record now
the intersection got a target
and theyre calling it downtown
you and all of your new perspective now
wish i could shut it in a closet
and drag you back down
and drag you back down
and drag you back downembed"
