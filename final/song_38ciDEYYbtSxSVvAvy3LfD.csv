some bands playing hallelujah
hallelujah
in the corner love
all night girls drink wine and try to sing along
i made a mess of things
the stops and in betweens
they weigh me down
you got someone new singing you your songs now

sooner surrender
then watch the last wall collapse
and sooner surrender
and our love will count for everything

in my sweetest dreams
its just you and me
and we break wide
i wake reminded love
how i just gave up
and how you moved on how you moved on

im waiting for something
ive waited for now
for the rolling canyons of love
and im tongue tied
and youre coming alive coming alive
you might also likesooner surrender
then watch the last wall collapse
and sooner surrender
and our love will count for everything

im sorry that youve gone
so sorry that youve gone
im sorry that youve gone
love
im sorry that youve gone
so sorry that youve gone away
youre a little bit right
more than a little bit right
with my arms around you

sooner surrender
then watch the last wall collapse
and sooner surrender
and our love will count for everything

sooner surrender
than watch the last wall collapse i know
sooner surrender and our love will count for everything
our love will count for everything
and i miss when you were everythingembed"
