the sun is nearly gone
the lights are turning on
a silver shine that stretches to the sea
weve stumbled on a view
thats tailormade for two
what a shame those two are you and me
some other girl and guy
would love this swirling sky
but theres only you and i
and weve got no shot

this could never be
youre not the type for me

mia
really

sebastian
and theres not a spark in sight
what a waste of a lovely night

mia
you say theres nothing here
well lets make something clear
i think ill be the one to make that call
you might also likesebastian
but youll call

mia
and though you looked so cute
in your polyester suit

sebastian
its wool

mia
youre right id never fall for you at all
and maybe this appeals
to someone not in heels
or to any girl who feels
theres some chance for romance

sebastian
whistling

mia
but im frankly feeling nothing

sebastian
is that so
mia
or it could be less than nothing

sebastian
good to know
so you agree

mia
thats right

sebastian  mia
what a waste of a lovely night14embed"
