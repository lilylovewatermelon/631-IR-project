theres something about the look in your eyes
something i noticed when the light was just right oh
it reminded me twice that i was alive
and it reminded me that youre so worth the fight

prechorus
ooh yeah
my biggest fear will be the rescue of me
strange how it turns out that way yeah

chorus
could you show me dear
something ive not seen
something infinitely interesting
could you show me dear
something ive not seen
something infinitely interesting oh

verse 2
theres something about the way you move
i see your mouth in slow motion when you sing ha ah
more subtle than something someone contrives
your movements echo that ive seen the real thing

prechorus
ooh yeah
your biggest fear will be the rescue of you
strange how it turns out that way yeah
