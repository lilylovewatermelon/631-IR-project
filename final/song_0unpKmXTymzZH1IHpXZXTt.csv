chorus
i was hoping that youd notice me notice me
im in the sky baby shine like a star baby star baby
and i know you dont believe in me believe in me
its in my heart baby im goin hard baby
say a prayer i feel like i cant breathe i cant breathe
you left my heart aching im torn apart baby apart baby
and i know you gon be missing me missing me
goin so far baby my life a tour baby

verse 1
got it on my own but still i aint independent
my day one been with me since day one he got perfect attendance
i wеnt got rich we started a business now wе split the percentage
thank god i dodged the sentence i went from rags to riches rags to riches
i made a better decision im in a better position
i grew my wings like a pigeon look like my wrist out the fridge fridge
that bitch can bring out my demons i said lil ho you the witch ho you the witch
i let her swallow my semen but that aint all that she did
im shinin bright like a diamond i hope and know you gon see it know you gon see it
im smoke exotic biscotti member we had bags of the mid bags of the mid
aint givin no fuck nigga shit im savin this cash for the kids
im keepin one hand in the sig gotta stay protected you dig

verse 2
im hearing voices in my head sayin boy give em hell
gettin on a yacht we bout to sail and they pray that we fail
they thought i went broke so i copped that patek huh patti labelle
real cheetah print skin inside of my jacket huh know i dress well
on the stage my fans show me real love like im fresh home outta jail
i got a new girl that got real natural curls and dont use no gel
im a realass boss you get laid off you still might get a referral
i come from that south boy watch your mouth you play we gon end your world
you lost they say you got swirled im a different breed like a merle
ima sip this oil til i hurl all my girls in diamonds and pearls
just want em to see that you chosen i met you outta this world
i want em to see that you chosen made it out the bottom of the barrel
