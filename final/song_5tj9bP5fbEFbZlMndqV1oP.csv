bitch i pull off in that chevy while im lightin up that heavy
bendin corners soakin up the game these sucka niggas always envy
comin out the cemetery ghost and servin up all these hoes
push my weight and stand on my toes im livin my life the way this shit goes
take a second learn yo lessons count yo blessings who you testin
grippin on that smith  wesson send yo ass straight up to heaven
thinkin bout more murder when this bunkers payin to trick my mind
bring that ana to my post and wet em up then give em slime
dancin with the devil kiss my sins upon they lips
dickin down the devils throat turn that ho into my bitch
watch me do my dougie pop my collar show my teeth and take a breath
smokin on that buddha cess gorilla blood inside my flesh
came from nothing turned it into something bitch you see me stuntin
pimpin suits and diamond cuff links hoes just wanna give me suction
pushin through the fuckin fast lane pouya told me get it mane
the pit is out the fuckin cage im lockin jaws splittin brains
hustle for my paper cause i dont know any other way
standin by the liquor store movin weight stayin paid
moving to a culdesac straight up out the fuckin hood
call my folks and let em know ramirez doin somewhat goodyou might also like3embed"
