well i remember friday nights
we were full of bull and natural light
rock stars under the parking lot lights
killing time in a little town
windows tinted up tailgates down
running our mouths riding up and down
just looking for a fight
we heard all our stories a thousand times
somebody go on and tell them again
aint nobody going to mind

chorus
heres to the good old boy
the guitars that made the noise
and all the girls that we annoyed
and the ones we kissed goodnight
to the trucks that drove us home
secrets we never told
and all the talks on old dirt roads
that somehow changed our lives
heres to the nights we dont remember
and the friends we wont forget

verse 2
like i still smell the crawfish stand
diving head first in the morning drink
standing in the lake watching water skis go by
got a pretty girl sitting on my shoulders
and another pretty girl trying to push her over
my boys on the bank letting the horse shoes fly
well i can still see it now
all of us piling in our trucks and heading back into town
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
heres to the good old boy
the guitars that made the noise
and all the girls that we annoyed
and the ones we kissed goodnight
to the trucks that drove us home
secrets we never told
and all the talks on old dirt roads
that somehow changed our lives
heres to the nights we dont remember
and the friends we wont forget

outro
heres to last call when we didnt care
holding our shots up in the air
a bunch of reckless boys
man i swear its a wonder we survived
to the trucks that drove us home
the secrets we never told
and all the talks on old dirt roads
that somehow changed our lives
heres to the nights we dont remember
heres to the nights we dont remember
and the friends we wont forgetembed"
