i dont have much to give but i dont care for gold
what use is money when you need someone to hold
dont have direction im just rolling down this road
waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

prechorus
youll never know the endless nights
the rhyming of the rain
or how it feels to fall behind
and watch you call his name

chorus
pack up and leave everything
dont you see what i can bring
cant keep this beating heart at bay
set my midnight sorrow free
i will give you all of me
just leave your lover leave him for me
leave your lover leave him for me

verse 2
we sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
oh im in love with you and you will never know
but if i cant have you ill walk this life alone
spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

youll never know the endless nights
the rhyming of the rain
or how it feels to fall behind
and watch you call his name

chorus
pack up and leave everything
dont you see what i can bring
cant keep this beating heart at bay
set my midnight sorrow free
i will give you all of me
just leave your lover leave him for me
leave your lover leave him for me
leave your lover leave him for me59embed"
