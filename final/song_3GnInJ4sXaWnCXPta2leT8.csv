i ran into a gas station and blew somebody head off they neck gunshot
i thought it was a dream but then i look and see that im a bloody wreck oh my god
i cant run to my mama house i know that she would never understand she would never understand
i might as well be a man and finish what the fuck i began fuck it its on
i walked out and started walking away like i aint seen a fuckin thing like i aint seen a fuckin thing
i went across the street and walked up to the drivethru window at a burger king at a burger king
i knocked on the glass and the kid leaned out to tell me they were closed close this gunshot
i blew a hole in his face and his boy was like damn you got hosed tommy you got hosed

i dragged his body in the back and did the same to everybody again did the same to everybody again
til the walls and the windows got so bloody wasnt nobody comin in wasnt nobody comin in
come out with your hands up
police started surrounding the building and i aint got no hostages
but i fronted like i did holdin up some dead kid
i said im comin out they said dont bother and started shootin damn
the corpse im holding up aint got no head and they aint stupid
i ran into the back and started drinkin drano bottles
gettin high as fuck im going out in a hail of bullets full throttle
i loaded my shit again but i never had a chance to shoot
somebody blew my head off all i heard was whhoooop
on the night of the 44
