when the lights go out will you take me with you
and carry all this broken bone through six years down
in crowded rooms and highways i call home
is something i cant know til now
til you picked me off the ground
with brick inhand your lipgloss smile
your scrapedup knees and—

chorus gerard way
if you stay i would even wait all night
or until my heart explodes
how long until we
find our way in the dark and out of harm
you can run away with me anytime you want

verse 2 gerard way
terrified of what id be
as a kid from what ive seen
every single day when people try
and put the pieces back together
just to smash them down
turn my headphones up real loud
i dont think i need them now
cause you stop the noise and—

if you stay i would even wait all night
or until my heart explodes
how long until we
find our way in the dark and out of harm

dont walk away dont walk away dont walk away
dont walk away

chorus gerard way
if you stay i would even wait all night
well or until my heart explodes
how long until we
find our way in the dark and out of harm
you can run away with me anytime you want
or you can write it on your arm
you can run away with me anytime you want22embed"
