hanging out behind the club on the weekend
acting stupid getting drunk with my best friends
i couldnt wait for the summer and the warped tour
i remember its the first time that i saw her there

verse 2 mark hoppus
shes getting kicked out of school cause shes failing
im kinda nervous cause i think all her friends hate me
shes the one shell always be there
she took my hand and i made it i swear

chorus mark hoppus
because i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said what and i told her that i didnt know
shes so cool gonna sneak in through her window

verse 3 mark hoppus
