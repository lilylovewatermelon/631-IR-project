too country whats that
is it like too republican or too democrat
is it too far to the left
too far to the right
too straight down the middle
is it too black or too white

verse 2
are the biscuits too fluffy is the chicken too fried
is the gravy too thick are the peas too blackeyed
is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang
are there too many lemons in mamas lemon meringue

verse 3
too country whats that
it is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpas old hat
is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
is the question too strong or the answer too weak

verse 4
are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright
are there too many stars in the heavens at night
are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too clean
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 5
is the grace too amazing is the steeple too tall
are there too many yes sirs yes maams
and howre yalls
is the message too really too close to the bone
do the fiddle and steel remind you too much of home
is honest and true just not in demand
too country
too country
too country
i dont understandembed"
