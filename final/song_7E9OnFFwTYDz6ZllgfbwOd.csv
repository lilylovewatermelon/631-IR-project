hit me once hit again
then im screaming at my friends
cause im at it again
tell me something tell me what you like
dont remind me that theres no one in sight
that youre my only friend
youre at it again

chorus
then im screaming in my head
when ive got nowhere to go
and im falling into bed
on a high chemical low
and i know im bound to lose
when i feel the need to use
why im full

verse 2
had it once never tried
is it true or is it a lie
youre at it again
every time i put my hands somewhere
theres always reeses there
im at it again
alone with a friend

then im screaming in my head
when ive got nowhere to go
and im falling into bed
on a high chemical low
and i know im bound to lose
when i feel the need to use
why im full

so whos it gonna be you or me when were done
if you get to know me at all will you run
i cant even think anymore
and im tired of the disadvantage
holding on for something alright

chorus
then im screaming in my head
when ive got nowhere to go
and im falling in my bed
on a high chemical low
and i know im bound to lose
when i feel the need to use
why im full
why im full13embed"
