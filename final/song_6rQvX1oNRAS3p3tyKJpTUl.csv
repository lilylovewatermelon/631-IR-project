shes always countin my beers then shes cuttin me off
she dont like none of my friends and shes scared of my dog
she never wants to party with me on the weekend
shes always pickin fights for no good reason man
she hates my old lucky boots always trashin my truck
tellin me what to do im just holdin my tongue
man my buddies didnt understand
til i told em yall her daddys got huntin land

chorus
a couple thousand acres up in kentucky
little slice of heaven out in gods country
break her heart lose the farm
aint a part of my twelvepoint plan
so ima bite the bullet hold it together
try to keep her happy least til december
if i aint in a stand ill be holdin her hand
cause her daddys got huntin land

verse 2
as soon as i shook his hand we were hittin it off
lookin up at the studs hangin up on his wall
she rolled her eyes tried to pull me out
but i was a deer in the headlights when he told me about

a couple thousand acres up in kentucky

aint a part of my twelvepoint plan
so ima bite the bullet hold it together

cause her daddys got huntin land

i probably shoulda cut bait for a hundred reasons
but i gotta make it through one rifle season on that

chorus
couple thousand acres up in kentucky
little slice of heaven out in gods country
break her heart lose the farm
aint a part of my twelvepoint plan
so ima bite the bullet hold it together
try to keep her happy least til december
if i aint in a stand ill be holdin her hand
cause her daddys got huntin landembed"
