verse 1 young buck
im loving how you look in my eyes swanging them hips when you pass
im visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
jump on this harley lets go smoke some of that bob marley
sip some bacardi then go pull up at the after party
i think we make a perfect couple but you think im trouble
maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number what
she got me feeling like maybe she the wrong woman
think ima be chasing a chickenhead youre on something
your toes painted hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha ill have you doing what you said that you wont do
make a decision shorty good things dont last long
your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
before i head home ima stop at your house and blow the horn
if you come outside you know its on holla at your boy

verse 2 lloyd banks
lately shes been frustrated with the baller wonder why i dont call her
maybe because im busy and she need someone to spoil her
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
she loves it when im in town hate it when im not around
i get her and wear her down next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hitting the ground just enough to hold us down
im sticking and moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a fortyyear old feel like a young lady
i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame fell in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasnt an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
im not your boyfriend im your homie
chorus joe
i wanna get to know ya
i really wanna fuck you baby
one dose of your loving
i know it gon drive me crazy
i wanna be your lover
i wanna get to know you baby
one dose of my loving
i know it gon drive you crazy

verse 3 50 cent
yeah
dont know what fucked me up more watching her lick her lips
or watching her walk she hypnotized me with her hips man
i sweet talk her if she like
cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
look im legit now i used to break laws
now you can reap the benefits of world tours wooo
big house big benz â€“ girl its yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws
you aint got to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
dont indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
cause it means somebodys gon hate you that never saw you
come here let me touch on you i let you touch on me
put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
let me ride on you and you can ride on
we can do it all the night we can have a baller night
