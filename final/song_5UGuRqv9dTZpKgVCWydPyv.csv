was the one you thought youd live by
and all you had to do was decide
a swimming pool size
well youre right

i wish there was an ending to spoil
so as long as im thinking
how about a great tragedy
where i imagine fire and glass and taillights blinking
well see

and if i was the betting kind i bet you thought the easy life
was the one you thought youd live by
all you had to do was decide
a swimming pool size
well youre right

i wish there was an ending to spoil
so as long as im thinking
about a horrible scene
where i can watch your hopes and your dreams
just blow into pieces
before me

is there something to learn
or something to see
because nothing to lose
is not nothing to be
you might also likehavent you
heard the messages
havent you
read the passages
theres a ghost who
is going to haunt me for all my life
ill bet he never touches you

i guess the differences
between us 3
they make our open books awful hard to read

maybe ive
been painting you
with all the wrong brushes too
maybe you
really know
what too much is well
well maybe you do

i wish there was an ending to spoil
so as long as im thinking
how about a great tragedy
where i imagine fire and glass and taillights blinking
well see
because nothing to lose is not nothing to be
because nothing to lose is not nothing to meembed"
