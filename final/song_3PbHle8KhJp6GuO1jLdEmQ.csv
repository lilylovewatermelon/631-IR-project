he spends his nights in california
watching the stars on the big screen
then he lies awake and he wonders
why can’t that be me
cause in his life hes filled with all these good intentions
he’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
but just before he says goodnight
he looks up with a little smile at me and he says

chorus
if i could be like that
i would give anything
just to live one day in those shoes
if i could be like that
what would i do
what would i do

now and dreams we run

verse 2
she spends her days up in the north park
watching the people as they pass
and all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
is that too much to ask
with a safe home and a warm bed
on a quiet little street
all she wants is just that something to hold onto
that’s all she needs

i’m falling into the same dreams
we run away
