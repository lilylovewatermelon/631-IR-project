dear today tomorrow here
man i was just checkin in hope youve been well
me im doin alright could always be better
seein as youre the only one with a choice in the matter
if i know you hell youre too busy
to do damn near anything that you ought to
guess what im sayin is is if you dont change
boy youll be kickin yourself one of these days

chorus
so maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
quit wastin our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
stop takin me for granted like ill always be around
cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin down
and remember every second i gots borrowed
so i hope you think of me today
sincerely tomorrow

verse 2
listen i aint tryin to bring you down
cause i know damn better than pushin you around
i guess i was just lookin out for you and me both
cause we both lose if i told you so

chorus
so maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
quit wastin our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
stop takin me for granted like ill always be around
cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin down
and remember every second i gots borrowed
so i hope you think of me today
sincerely tomorrow
