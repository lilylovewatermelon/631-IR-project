until i die until im gone until i cant see light no more
ill be your queen your everything cuz youve been so good to me
until i die until im gone until my last words have been told
cmon
until i die until i pass cuz our love was meant to last

yeah yeah check it
i remember when i met you couldnt get you off my mind even when i close my eyes
all i could think was you gotta be mine
theres no replacement for your smile and pretty eyes
the way you never cursed at me even when i made you cry
weve come a long way since that very first day
skipping class to be together in the hallway
you made me feel like i got reason to live
my pride possession my medallion my best friend
through the drama pain funerals and family fights
not for one second did you ever leave my side
thats why i love you girl te quiero de verdad
and if i lose you girl hasta la muerte voy a llorar

until i die until im gone until i cant see light no more
ill be your queen your everything cuz youve been so good to me
until i die until im gone until my last words have been told
until i die until i pass cuz our love was meant to last

before my eyes close and my soul goes home
these were words that i never told you
you were everything to me my last hope my last dream
and on my last breath i will tell you this
you are my sunrise and my sunset my best friend
who i would share my last dollar with you were the last of my faith
in these last days and please let it be you to kiss away these
last tears too fall from my face until my last hour im yours
my last hug my last kiss the last smile on my lips
but my last regret was this that i never even got a chance to
tell you this tell you this

until i die until im gone until i cant see light no more
ill be your queen your every thing cuz youve been so good to me
until i die until im gone until my last words have been told
until i die until i pass cuz our love was meant to last
gemini
in the blink of an eye im a meet my demise
and live only as a memory deep in the mind
but until that day comes when i breathe no more
just know who i lived life for
i used to walk in the darkness with no real purpose in life
never blinded just never really cared about life
i used to say once youre born youre just waiting to die
and every day in between is just a waste of some time
but in time i was convinced that i was far from the truth
believe it or not i found truth the night i met you
so just know that if theres life after death im a wait for you there
to love you forever for real

chorus
until i die until im gone until i cant see light no more
ill be your queen your every thing cuz youve been so good to me
until i die until im gone until my last words have been told
until i die until i pass cuz our love was meant to lastembed"
