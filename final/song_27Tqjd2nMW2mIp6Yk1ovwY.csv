all the school kids are so sick of books and learnin
they dont read anymore they dont even read anymore
they just wanna be like all the rappers that i cant stand
niggas we dont need anymore
all the niggas we dont need anymore
and all the cops are still hangin out at the doughnut shops
talkin bout how the weathers changin
the ice is meltin as if the world is endin

chorus
she asked me
who are you gonna be when its all over when its all over
she asked me
who are you gonna be when its all over when its all over
i dont wanna think about that right now
heat of the moment
heat of the moment girl heat of the moment
i aint even got a strap if you think we really need one im on it
the last man fucked up ill take it since he doesnt want it
cant think straight in the heat of the moment heat of the moment

interlude
what are we even doing

verse 2
ridin clean
with you on my mind and im thinkin dirty things
