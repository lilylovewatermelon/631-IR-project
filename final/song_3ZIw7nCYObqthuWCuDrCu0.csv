does it go from aeast to west yall
body free and a body less yall
come again just to start afresh and
once again to find a home
in the moment of the meantime
dropping in coming through the mesh yall
checking in just to get it blessed yall
hard to leave when its picturesque and
find a form thats free to roam

chorus
where you come from where you going
where you come from where you going

verse 2
do it all then it all again yall
make it up and you make a friend yall
paddle on just around the bend and
find a place where you can see
all the mamas and the papas
take a chance on a recommend yall
hard as hell just to comprehend yall
disbelief that i do suspend and
easy now to find a breeze

where you come from where you going
where you come from where you going

your stylish mess of silver hair
a woman of your kind is rare
your uniform returns to air

the waves you made will always be
your kiss goodbye before you leave
gloria is love my friend
