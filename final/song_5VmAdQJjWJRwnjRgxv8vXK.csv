nah it aint that im rich that they hate so much
least i could do it not rub it in niggas face so much
so im tryin now while im rhymin not to brag about the island
or the crib in hawaii where all the walls slide in
house is wide open we could bring the outside in
i think you should hear about it but fuck it ill be quiet
i just spit it how i live it homie i dont be lyin
would it make you feel better if i put my pockets on a diet
if i made less money started to dress bummy
would the haters and the critics have more respect for me
should i downgrade the crib and the way i live
