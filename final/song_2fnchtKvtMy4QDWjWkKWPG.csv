this part is the future

youve been dying to battle me danny
and its been a long wait
but you even look at me the wrong way and its long blades
see saw shank theres no escaping this shit it aint shawshank
now can you picture a way beyond these bars or is it all hate
desperado lawyer my secret weapon gonna get our case
secret weapon gun in a guitar case
how we gonna deal with the shit i throw up at him
 howie deal hidden connections i invented that
im on a level that you never knew
see two dimensional rappers
depending how it shapes up on paper can be acceptable
but 3d writers go so far in depth you can literally see what he says to you
but im on a different level of writing the fourth dimensional
timing its too exceptional
i write shit you never do some people said hes a one trick pony
well im correcting you
cause your lines gotta connect two points to be one dimensional
youre not even that
die mentioning dimensional my name next to you
cause it something you could never measure to
get drugged within an inch of your life for acting all cocky
and every rapper in the world can get it
ill get em all bodied to they all stop me
why carve into his chest for the autopsy
thats more good morgue news
but the coroner cant handle it another one
you said im getting sloppy i shouldve used a fucking gun
the cops get suspicious of what ive done
so i throw his body in the wood chipperand let him blend in with the other ones
im changing the landscape danny
welcome to the golden age
if rap was so much better in the olden days
then why is your favorite fucking rapper dumpster diving for my throwaways
theyre all trash and you wonder why your rep dying
you let randy leave with the billsbills without a jet flying
so fucking long he changed his rap name from trex to rex ryan
 convince his wolf gang banging and block wars
always have your word as proof we need a lot more
youre morgan freeman you narrate a story that is not yours
youve never been shot at youve been shot for
and we can see the difference
those hand me down shoes you never fit in so boom
yeah ah di boom soon as you couldnt cry victim
you went to dry snitching to anybody whod listen
and when they didnt you wrote blogs instead
see i can tell youre an informant that talks to feds
ci can tell youre an informant that talks to feds
youre just a rat searching for words to help the pigs
fuck is this charlottes web
you will burnwilburn and for no inferno reason you let it transpire
i will torture torch your soul for our sins arson dan myers
one strike then youll witness the matchbook backfire
scorch in eternal flames underground with this shit
blame the devil for the other two rounds of this shit
early
you might also likeround 1 danny myers
ill catch gjonaj coming out his house with his whorish tramp
put the double barrel on his eyes then click the power forward hes horace grant
ill erase this bastard that blast from the pump his face will splatter
youll see a quarter slide away from this man like jacobs ladder
i caught his bitch i cornered her
sent her straight to the coroner
see didnt look like she was from round here thats why i put four in her foreigner
two mac 11s two 45s am i thuggin
thats been answered
i just hope these four fore arms aint spotted like skin cancer
ill slap the fuck out you
bitch i need a therapist
ill write your grandma a fuck you note then have it translated in arabic
do you believe in a parallel universe i do
the shit is insane peep this
my daddy was in prison playing spades while i was working on my pen game
dannys predictable got a bunch of name flips for gjonaj
dont i
you figured id have a joan of arc bar dont lie
ill catch you in the twilight then zone
im a monster on this plain plane
no one believes you even though you see it with your own eye gjonaj
i keep a k in hand
bars
i keep a k in hand just to remind you not to play with dan
the chopper will flip your v sideways to show you im greater than
any normal beef im in the fifth get pulled
but for you im on sat phone with my contact in istanbul
hes a professional at making muscles relax
he provided the materials used in a brussels attack
but he missed his target furtherin the tensions that you and i harbor
ill pull shrapnel from a dead body and utilize armor
your man was blown to pieces but you gon die calmer
my jacket colder than death suicide bomber
dont speak to me
bitch ass niggas i beam frequently
when i sleep i dont see pictures i dream frequencies
i emerged from a dangerous hood a gifted spitter
where crooked cops put they hands on a kid like mystic river
twisted niggas will snatch yo mom theres nothing around scarier
their instructions are simple if she mock mach me or sound bury her barrier
you food to us we gon catch you and bash in your teeth
this meal is unhealthy but you savagely feast
ill have some ms gs msg spot you then clash in the streets
then ill make your whore moan hormone just to add to the beef
but thats not even in a g mo
the heater low run up on him and let the can flicker
all in his face with the desert like what you sayin nigga
fuck you start for
i like the art form on bar wars
but i get it jumpin cause what im building is off the wall like parkour
you must remind yourself killing niggas is my signature
even my autographs are a sign of death my minds a mess
all i think about is different ways of assaultin
along with playing the race card and saying everything insultin in sultan
king of the dot if yall wanted to test my pen yall couldve got the best with the flows
yall couldve matched me with soul con soul khan instead hell see the specs on the nose
your death will be cold
and you on the ground with this shit
this wack mc gotta another two rounds of this shit
yikes
round 2 gjonaj
you like those arabic jokes huh
well danny already has his foot in the grave
but in a plot twist i dug him out
cause its finally a massacre in the middle east americans give a fuck about
while they genocide christians theyre condemning a religion
while god is my witness i must first own up to my sins to cast the first stone bar god
ill kill him sunday then ask for forgiveness
does that make me a hypocrite
b dot said you got fedex well allow me to flip the shit
cause if i go postal shoot the messenger but i didnt pay for the box i just delivered it
im sick enough to be admitted in a methadone clinic
but admit it i could put on a clinic with my method
you either get itor forget it
theres only so much you can try with logic
then you switch to diagnostics to fiber optics
you  points are you a bar god or a false dying prophet
if you ask me youre scared to believe in anything so you die agnosticdiagnostic
you got it backwards you never read a good book and rely on technological advances
youre the same idiot praying for a tablet
it was written in stone and real soldiers know what a command meant commandment
thou shall not worship a false idol
only the bible can rival the penmanship ive been blessed with
every sentence pen is effortless
every battle i attack with a religious emphasis
because while you were playing sega i was reading genesis
then the lights go out and the crowd loses their collective minds
gjonaj
you are not my nemesis
you are a narcissist i am nepotist
you favor your fucking self i favor my fucking family its all relative
im bout to open up a fucking museum with these skeletons
danny what did you tell your kids when you packed up and moved on em
what about vicky shell boom it happens too often
everyone close to you suffers im through talking
you back stabbed everyone on earth so im moonwalking
i said did that upset you
what about when you told rex he died the same day as his nephew
you sold your soul at that venue
you booked the battle even paid for travel
you went on smackurl and it was a favor that they let you
how could anyone respect you
where is your honor
look how you treat your own children all they see is a monster
if danny wasnt battle rapping hed never see his daughters
imagine having to move to boston just to see your father
thats the power
no thats the power behind inner and outer
for you they let out a reaction an outer reaction
but i make it hard for em to breathe
in the span of four bars they feel pride shame hate love they ran out of reactions
i know longer worry if i get a reaction
theyre too paralyzed by emotion to give a reaction
im winning simply off of inner reaction within a reaction
inner reaction within a reaction its bigger than rappin
let him have his final thoughts
cause martyrs die for a cause you died for a cost

round 2 danny myers
let me guess
youre a christian muslim
that shit is overblown
ill slit your throat with a cross hows that for religious overtones
this shouldve been spoken on but im amongst the furious crowd
surrounded by abandoned buildings and ak bullets piercin the clouds
a corrupt government and everything near me is wild
bitch im speaking through the eyes of a syrian child
ive been in war way before you came across the boarder clown
my pen has shown men how to blow up
now im showin them that theres more to rounds mortar rounds
the homie loaned me a used burner he keep those thangs
that bitch didnt come in its original case like pre owned games
when i stash the tre youll be cremated to ash today
once the tom stay in his mouth the gun is then cast away
get your focus right
ill poke this knife til hes a poltergeist
you better seek shelter in detroit like eminem at an open mic
youre a joke nobody believes youre out here clappin toys
you just a bitch nigga that talks to his coworkers in his rappin voice
i didnt have a choice
i ran with killers who put niggas in the soil for me
while you out here betting on battles with mommy and daddys oil money
but you know the drill
i keep fire you cant peep myers
why the fuck would yall put the god of bar fest versus a weak writer
ill drive down the block looking for you ill spot you
jump out crouch then sweep thats the most basic combo in street fighter
but we got a lot in common like the shit we rap about
we got a tainted mind
we sit down and paint a rhyme to express all the pain inside
but yall notice something those bars that aggression
aint it mine
now i must kill my own creation im victor frankenstein
you picked a dangerous time the wrong nigga to offer to kyle
ill punch you with the adrenaline a mother uses to lift a car off of her child
you know how somebody been dead for six minutes
and surgeons are working through a blood puddle with speed
and then resuscitated and the first thing someone ask him is what did you see
well what if its me
adored in reapers cloth
i feature thoughts that were written in the lost pages like the beepers off
it gets deeper boss
i cant promise i will not hurt you
you just a fake mark in this field you let the crop circle
you the jealous type
upset that my style will beat ya
red dots will leave spots in his scalp like alopecia
the devil disguises himself as your friend
you dont even know you got the beast with you
niggas be walking with the pitchfork in they circle like the peace symbol
i leave him buried in his own backyard i got the glocks cocked
two bad bitches will fuck up his house like knock knock
albanian composer simon gjoni
does that ring a bell to you
well it should you fucking stole his identity
but what you failed to do was recreate his greatness
i got to hurt these feelings
im giving you death out of compassion its like a mercy killing
first we peeling the skin off his bitch then let the gat burst
my german dog will hit the lick with me and do his brat worse bratwurst
we clap first
and he on the ground with this shit
this wack mc got a whole nother round of this shit
yikes

round 3 gjonaj
now ima take you to the past

said vance bagged to me slaughter names
bagged as in cold bodies that hand out when you wanted change
these rappers are all the same
just empty fucking vessels that lack something
so they substitute substance with bad punches and i dont owe you a fucking thing
im what you had coming
but its easy to give up everything when you have nothing
i hate the fucking expression nothing to lose
is it priceless or worthless i guess its up to the view
see destroying your life was just something to do
but its all sentimental it only means something to you
im the black cloud on a perfect day with enough rain to drown you with
but im also the perfect day that surrounded it
the full map of a grand design
just an idea trapped in a mind i cant fucking die
you dont think ive tried
yesterday i jumped off a fucking cliff and found out i could fly
i played russian roulette with a full clip and survived
i only left you alive just to suffer through the last one
a calculated risk none of this is random
youre who the weak run to im who they ran from
the people who hate my voice dont even fucking have one
get mutilated
picture me stabbing a helpless victim or the hatchet hacking into him like an algorithm
a clear cut code of my own design
a basic operation where patients are prone to die
cause im a neurosurgeon i can only work with an open mind
and thats why
an open mind i mean try something you gon see the other side
and thats why in less time im better than you
you made a couple bad choices i had nothing better to do than put the metal to you
twin deuce deuces what a catch 22
i said its me versus you danny
did it really matter what league we battle on
sometimes you gotta take an extra step to decide what path youre on
but be careful who you step to
if you cant step up then step down and stay alive
you thought you wouldve stepped forward but really you were  just an extra step to the side
my how quickly psycosespsychosis passed then reality set in before the time stopped
paul pierce the truth is sometimes you gotta take a step back for the right shot
you were in the right spot danny but you picked the wrong time
so its you i gotta cut in front of everyone to skip a long line
im not waiting you shouldve never crossed my path myers
you knew it would get bad myers
i didnt want to have to bag myers
but they told me i had to kill any and every one that admires myers
so i had to add myers as part of my dark plan
and by the off chance you survive im shooting with my off hand
word to every fucking freckle you got youve been a marked man

round 3 danny myers
you are fucking wack
i hope the fans had enough of you yet
bitch i cant die either
just standing on my front porch is russian roulette
i wanna beat the shit out you
you know how someone been owing you money for like three months
every time you see him he aint got it
then one day you just so happen to catch him and he out shoppin
thats when its no longer about the money
this is easily comprehensible
sometimes you just gotta whoop a nigga ass on principle principal
bitch i will canelo alvarez right hand your soul in honor together
along with a couple moves i stole from conor mcgregor
i lived in detroit for years on the west side dexter and davison
i know niggas in brightmoor and inkster
i suggest you dont play with them
i freestyle battled swan was cool with the dreadnaughtz
i aint trying to exploit shit
but i aint finna sit here and let a fake nigga tell me about some detroit shit
pussy
i brought a knife for you
the glock burst for his brother
gjonaj will be next to the blade like a clockwork orange cover
elbow right hook then catch this knee itll leak ya
yall aint seen an arab pussy get beat like this since mia khalifa
see me with a sweeper fuck yo album they half do it
when this m pc see mpc him i aint gotta hear this araabmuzik
this is all cerebral a mental challenge that i have sworn to win
fuck your religious angles jesus youre not battling born again
this is me at 20 these bars you couldnt handle fully
hoe a christmas caroler couldnt hold a candle to me
i ran with bullies thatll put you on camera dont become viral
free ah di boom cause i still rock with jersey like gun titles
im unrivaled absolute power unbridled
dumb kyle will get shot at until it becomes idle
on my end mayan youll get hit in the head with a sun dial
there gun fire before cops are called and your son dials
ill kidnap your wife and your kid
they both part of a lesson
i gotta do this to em cause you both saw that aggression
ill hold him to a fifth story window
once the kids out the mom gon go through it thats postpartum depression
when they cheer for me it gives me an energy beyond myers
the crowd just adds to the heat its like a bonfire
if i aint got the 45 or 12 gauge the chopper suffice
this machine will tell you whether weather we cool or not like a doppler device
you can get it to advance warfare the tec gon shoot
tap his ex x twice she fly across the room she got the exo suit
shawn morrison writes half your shit
behind the scenes he puts the time in
you just play the role as the gunman behind shawn pen sean penn
ill walk up on him wont say a word then the toast liftin ya
this silencer conversates with the dead its like a ghost whisperer
im outta here
whats the difference between a whisper and a scream when theyre both done out of fear
ill pull the trigger under your chin all out in public
put your thoughts in the sky you can think with cloudy judgement
im wild but fuck it
for the last years ive been at every stage and i smoke writers
and tell hollow da don he gotta see me for that goat title
throat slice him
and he on the ground with this shit
thank the lord he aint got another round of this shit
yikesembed"
