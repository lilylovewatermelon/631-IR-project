outro matt van schie
now its over youve taken your life
dark grows thin and left to hide
i dont regret it but its sad anyway
now were both dead and so scared of the black
this life of games and diligent trust
its the things we do and the things we must
im now tired of being cussed
so go sleep forever end to dust25embed"
