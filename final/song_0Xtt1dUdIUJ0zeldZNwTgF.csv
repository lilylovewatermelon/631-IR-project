im sure that he could give you everything
stability and diamond rings
all the things i do not have
i understand you cant handle that
but for everything that i lack
i provide something you almost had
hot flesh that you yearn to grab
pit of your stomach youre still so sad

chorus
ooh what you gonna do
im in love with you
dont you wanna dance
this may be the last chance last chance
that i get i get to love you to love you
oohoohooh

verse 2
out of sight not out of mind
you want the world ill give you mine
cause youre the girl ill never find
and im the boy youve left behind whoa
i know you think youre satisfied
and god knows how hard we try
but if you showed up at my door ooh
i could give you so much more oh

i wonder if you kept the ones you have
keep them locked up somewhere safe
cause its the only place youll see my face
