sufjan stevens
i count the days the great frontier
forgiving faced the seventh year
i stand in awe of gratefulness
i can and call forgetfulness

sufjan stevens  shara worden
and when i and when i call
the patient the patient fall
the spirit the carpenter
invites us to be with her

the illinoisemaker choir
what have we become america
soldiers on the great frontier
carpenter and soldier one on one
it’s the battle volunteer

the illinoisemaker choir  shara worden
the prairie the frontier the perfect farm it’s from here
run from yourself from your friends
the fortress the faker the cornerstone the baker
run for your life for your friends
the dancer the fisher audition and the disher
america
the boxer the fetcher the chewing gum dream catcher
oh illinois
you might also likesufjan stevens
i count the days the great frontier
forgiving faced the seventh year
i stand and strain to make ends meet
five spirits on the grand marquee

sufjan stevens  shara worden
and when i and when i call
the patient the patient fall
the spirit the carpenter
invites us to be with her

sufjan stevens  tom eaton
there was a man at the wall
he was grateful for us all
i saw the wise woman sing
she wasnt asking anything
she wasnt asking anything
how she made the nations sing

shara worden  the illinoisemaker choir
what have we become america
soldiers on the great frontier

the illinoisemaker choir  shara worden
the mattress the floozies the actress at the movies
run from yourself from your friends
the lantern the lotion the wind that wakes the ocean
run for your life for your friends
the standard addition the architects rendition
america
the fashion the fevers the house we got at sears
oh illinois
instrumental

part ii come to me only with playthings now

sufjan stevens shara worden  katrina kerns
oh great fire of great disaster
oh great heaven oh great master
oh great goat the curse you gave us
oh great ghost protect and save us
oh great river green with envy
oh jane addams spirit send thee
oh great trumpet and the singers
given what you lost are you better off
oh great goodman king of swingers
given what you had has it made you mad
oh great bears and bulls joe jackson
celebrate the few celebrate the new
oh great illinois
it can only start with you1embed"
