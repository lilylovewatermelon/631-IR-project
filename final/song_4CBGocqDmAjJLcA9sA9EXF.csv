bury the hatch pushing a tack in la detach this beaten path
im losing track of all the days im wasting on winning one thought
im a real player but i forgot all the rearranging my gordian knot
carry me back show me my past
looking through rose glass
missing my ma missing my pa
im losing track of all the days ive wasted in hollywood land
all the cars and pavement driving me mad
but theres still a place that i understand

yes i must be patient
playing this band got a couple aces
maybe a chance but the lonely feeling is it gonna lastyou might also like2embed"
