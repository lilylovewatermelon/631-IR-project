it wasnt supposed to be like this
another dose of unhappiness
i gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
so i got drunk had sex with all your friends
you told me that i should never call your house again

chorus
emily emily
aaahhh
you saved the day
emily emily
aaahhh
when you threw me away

she was always such a pretty girl
nobody like her in the world
a little piece of heavenly
that no one else could stand
i see her in my dreams at night
i see her when i close my eyes
i just cant seem to shake
emily

verse 2
you got your money and i got cast
outside thrown out on my ass
in the city with no one else
nowhere else to go
so then i hooked up
with a model from singapore
emily i sure am glad that
you didnt want me anymore
