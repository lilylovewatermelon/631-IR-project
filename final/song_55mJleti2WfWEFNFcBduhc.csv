i know the pieces fit
cause i watched them fall away
mildewed and smoldering
fundamental differing
pure intention juxtaposed
will set two lovers souls in motion
disintegrating as it goes
testing our communication

bridge
the light that fueled our fire then
has burned a hole between us so
we cannot seem to reach an end
crippling our communication

verse 2
i know the pieces fit
cause i watched them tumble down
no fault none to blame
it doesnt mean i dont desire
to point the finger blame the other
watch the temple topple over
to bring the pieces back together
rediscover communication
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likebridge
the poetry that comes from
the squaring off between
and the circling is worth it
finding beauty in the dissonance

verse 3
there was a time that the pieces fit
but i watched them fall away
mildewed and smoldering
strangled by our coveting
ive done the math enough to know
the dangers of our secondguessing
doomed to crumble unless we grow
and strengthen our communication

bridge
cold silence has a tendency to
atrophy any sense of compassion
between supposed lovers
between supposed lovers

outro
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
i know the pieces fit
and i know the pieces fit41embed"
