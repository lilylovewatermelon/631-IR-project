who never understood
never looked inside myself
though on the outside i looked good
then we met and you made me
the man i am today
tracy im in love with you
no matter what you weigh
cause without love
life is like the seasons with no summer
without love
life is rock n roll without a drummer
tracy ill be yours forever
cause i never wanna be without love
tracy never set me free no i aint lying
never set me free tracy no no no
living in the ghetto
black is everywhere ya go
whod have thought id love a girl
whose skin was white as winter snow
in my ivory tower
life was just a hostess snack
but now ive tasted chocolate
and im never going back
cause without love
life is like a beat that you cant follow
without love
life is doris day at the apollo
darling ill be yours forever
cause i never wanna be without love
so darling never set me free
no im yours forever
never set me free no no no
you might also likei dont know what ill do
link ive got to break out
so that i can get my hands on you
and girl if i cant touch you
then im gonna lose control
seaweed youre my black white knight
ive found my blueeyed soul
sweet freedom is our goal
trace i wanna kiss you
let me out at the next toll
without love
life is like a prom that wont invite us
without love
its like getting my big break and laryngitis
without love
lifes a 45 when you cant buy it
without love
life is like my mother on a diet
like a week thats only mondays
only ice cream never sundaes
like a circle with no center
like a door marked do not enter
darling ill be yours forever
cause i never wanna be without love
yes now youve captured me
without love i surrender happily
without love oh seaweed
never set me free no no no i aint lying
never set me free no no no
no i dont wanna live without love love love
darling you had best believe me
never leave me without loveembed"
