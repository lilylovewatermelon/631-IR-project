sometimes you have to let go
to free fall away
i wont judge you anymore
cause sometimes i needed to
free fall far away
out of sight out of mind

verse 2
im so tired
where can i lay my head
ill just close my eyes
hope i wake up dead
dont want to live without you
dont leave me out here to die

outro
maybe another time and space
when i can look you in the face
far far away
maybe in another lifesee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like5embed"
