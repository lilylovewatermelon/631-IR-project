im alone it’s just me and i’m watching tv
and i’m always oh so bored at home
i get up i get out
drive my car way downtown
keep on calling but youre never around
see my friends out tonight under these city lights
in the club til someone starts a fight
and we get in the car
still dont know where you are
im so pissed off always hanging around

prechorus 1
and i’m so tired
you’re fired

chorus
i’m so jealous restless relentless
that’s just me
im so crazy lately come on let it be
dont make me beg for the things i need
you know what they say
where there’s a will there’s a way
lies are free talk is cheap

verse 2
now were out in the street and were sweating the heat
and we move with the traffic and the beat
i don’t care if you choke when you light up your smoke
it’s the one thing i can call my own
you might also likeprechorus 2
its so tragic
im so manic

chorus
i’m so jealous restless relentless
that’s just me
im so crazy lately come on let it be
dont make me beg for the things i need
you know what they say
where there’s a will there’s a way
lies are free talk is cheap

prechorus 1
and i’m so tired
you’re fired

chorus
i’m so jealous restless relentless
that’s just me
im so crazy lately come on let it be
dont make me beg for the things i need
you know what they say
where there’s a will there’s a way
lies are free talk is cheap
outro
talk is cheap
yeah lies are free and talk is cheap1embed"
