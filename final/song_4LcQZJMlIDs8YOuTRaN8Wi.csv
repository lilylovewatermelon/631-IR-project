verse 1
i sit around and watch the tube but nothings on
i change the channels for an hour or two
twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
im sick of all the same old shit
in a house with unlocked doors and im fuckin lazy

chorus
bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind
and i smell like shit

verse 2
peel me off this velcro seat and get me movin
i sure as hell cant do it by myself
im feelin like a dog in heat
barred indoors from the summer street
i locked the door to my own cell and i lost the key

chorus
bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind
and i smell like shit
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likebridge
i got no motivation
where is my motivation
no time for motivation
smoking my inspiration huh

verse 3
i sit around and watch the phone but no ones callin
call me pathetic call me what you will we will
my mother says to get a job
but she dont like the one shes got
when masturbations lost its fun youre fuckin lonely

chorus
bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind
and loneliness has to suffice
bite my lip and close my eyes
im slippin away to paradise
some say quit or ill go blind
but its just a myth38embed"
