primadonna girl yeah
all i ever wanted was the world
i cant help that i need it all
the primadonna life the rise and fall
you say that im kinda difficult
but its always someone elses fault
got you wrapped around my finger babe
you can count on me to misbehave
primadonna girl

would you do anything for me
buy a big diamond ring for me
would you get down on your knees for me
