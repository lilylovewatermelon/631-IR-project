hello
you know you look even better than the way you did the night before
and the moment that you kiss my lips you know i start to feel wonderful
its somethin incredible
theres sex in your chemicals oh
ooh lets go
youre the best way i know to escape the extraordinary
this world aint for you and i know for damn sure this world aint for me
lift off and say goodbye
just let your fire set me free

chorus
oh moonshine
take us to the stars tonight
take us to that special place
that place we went the last time the last time

verse 2
i know
i was with you last night but it feels like its been so long
and everybody thats around they notice that im not myself when youre gone
its good to see you again
good to see you again
on top of the world uh
is where i stand when youre back in my life
lifes not so bad when youre way up this high
everything is alright
everything is alright
