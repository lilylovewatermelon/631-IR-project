spending every moment in the studio
i never said itd be fair
but when youre all alone i hope you truly know
how bad i want to be there

chorus drake
come right in set your bag down
took a night off for you
go ahead and turn the lights off
but keep your heels on
theyre fittin for what im about to do oh
know you hate explaining how you want it done
just be quiet ill do fine without your help girl
can you work without a second for some fun
now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
and i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it

verse 2 lloyd
i been waiting for so long to get you all alone
now i finally got you right here
so baby ima lock my door and disconnect my phone
cause i wanna make one thing clear
i want you on top so let your hair down
i took the night off for you
