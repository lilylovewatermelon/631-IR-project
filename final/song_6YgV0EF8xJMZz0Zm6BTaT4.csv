i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart oh

chorus
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore

postchorus
whoa oh oh
whoa oh oh
whoa oh oh oh

verse 2
i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied oh
kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again
but i know

and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore

and make sure everythings alright its alright its alright
