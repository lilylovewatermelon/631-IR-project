at slow speed we all seem focused
in motion we seem wrong wrong
in summer we can taste the rain

chorus
i want you to be free
dont worry about me
and just like the movies
we play out our last scene

verse 2
two can play this game
we both want power
in winter we can taste the pain
in our short years we come long way
to treat it bad and throw away
in our short years we come long way
to treat it bad and throw away

chorus
i want you to be free
dont worry about me
and just like the movies
we play out our last scene
you wont cry i wont scream

in our short years we come long way
to treat it bad and throw away
and if we make a little space
a sciencefiction showcase
in our short film a love disgrace
dream a scene to brighten face
in our short years we come long way
to treat it bad just to throw it away

chorus
i want you to be free
dont worry about me
and just like the movies
we play out our last scene
you wont cry i wont scream4embed"
