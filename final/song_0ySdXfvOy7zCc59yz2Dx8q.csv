verse 1 gwen stefani
im the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
takin it in try to be feminine
with my makeup bag watchin all the sin
misfit i sit
lit up wicked
everybody else surrounded by the girls
with the tank tops and the flirty words hey baby

prechorus 1 gwen stefani
im just sippin on chamomile
watchin boys and girls and their sex appeal
with a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
and went to my high school
