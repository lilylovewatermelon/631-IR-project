sundown
ever so slow now
remind me im a free man
freeer than ive been
its something im feeling
im wonderfully breathing
blessed in the rainfall
cleansed like the downpour

prechorus
and i know its fine to end our time
be safe be true and ill think of you

chorus
live well you reap what you sow
the future is bright if we can ebb with the flow
youre something im nothing we were everything
anything to save me from the goodness she gave me

verse 2
moonrise
over my headlights
and im on the right trail
ive taken my life there
and tied it upside down
youre living for that sweet sound
you laugh like the warm sun
cuts through me like the only one
see palace liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeprechorus
and i know its fine to end our time
be safe be true and ill think of you

chorus
live well you reap what you sow
the future is bright if we can ebb with the flow
youre something im nothing we were everything
anything to save me from the goodness she gave me

bridge
its nothing less a mystery
how it came to this i see
and if it comes to this i know
well have had more than most did so
in a dream that i have had
we departed ended what we had started
and i pray it doesnt come to that
if it does thanks for the love we had

chorus
live well you reap what you sow
the future is bright if we can ebb with the flow
youre something im nothing we were everything
anything to save me from the goodness she gave me
live well you reap what you sow
the future is bright if we can ebb with the flow
youre something im nothing we were everything
anything to save me from the goodness she gave me3embed"
