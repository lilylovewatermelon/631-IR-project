over a couple of years his spurs have grown
he wasnt safe to keep around the home
when he almost took an eyeball from lonnys son
and i was in the kitchen making fig preserves
and i heard that youngin getting kicked in the face
and i knew it was the day that that rooster was gonna get what he deserves
