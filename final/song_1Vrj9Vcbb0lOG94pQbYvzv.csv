i found the street of the house in which you stay
and my diarys full of your name on every page
cause i read somewhere youll fall in love with me
ill try and try again one day youll see
your hairs under my pillow so i sleep so i sleep
and im dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet at my feet

chorus
im obsessed with you in a way i cant believe
when you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me me me me me
do you wipe them just for me me me me me
im pleading on my knees knees knees knees knees
its your touch that i need need need need need

verse 2
i followed you today i was in my car
i wanted to come and see you from afar
if you turned around and saw me i would die
id pretend i was a person driving by
wrote you a song do you wanna hear it now hear it now
dont bring your friends along to form a crowd crowd
cause i need to prove i wrote it just for you just for you
whats the need for them when it could be just us two two two two two

chorus
im obsessed with you in a way i cant believe
when you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me me me me me
do you wipe them just for me me me me me
im pleading on my knees knees knees knees knees
its your touch that i need need need need need
