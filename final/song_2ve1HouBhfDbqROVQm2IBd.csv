you’re a oneofaone a oneofakind
that you only find once in a lifetime
made to fit like a fingerprint
a code that clicks and opens a gold mine
prechorus 1
they say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
when i found you it was all pitterpatter
verse 2
secretly i hit the lottery
cause youre brighter than all of the northern lights
you speak to me even in my dreams
wouldnt let you go for even the highest price
prechorus 2
they say one man’s trash is another girl’s treasure
so if it’s up to me i’m gonna keep you forever
chorus
cause i understand you
we see eyetoeye
like a double rainbow in the sky
and wherever you go so will i
cause a double rainbow is hard to find

yeah our chemistry was more than science
it was deafening loud like lightning
it was striking you couldnt deny it

they say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure

chorus
cause i understand you
we see eyetoeye
like a double rainbow in the sky
and wherever you go so will i
cause a double rainbow is hard to find
bridge
to the bottom of the sea id go to find you oh
climb the highest peak to be right beside you oh
every step i take im keeping you in mind
oohoohoohooh

chorus
cause i understand you
we see eyetoeye
like a double rainbow in the sky
and wherever you go and wherever you go so will i
cause a double rainbow is hard to find
