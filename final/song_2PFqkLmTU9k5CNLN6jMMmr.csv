chorus
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

verse 1
its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit
we say “we do it for our baby” but we dont
we do it for us its lust cause neither one
of us trust each other so we fuck til we bust
and we cuss each other out we know what its about shout
til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
fist fight til we turn this mother out
then apologize after laughter pain
its insane were back in the same chapter again
and its sad but its true when im layin here with you
there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause—

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more

i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

verse 2
cause i hate you do you hate me
good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they aint got proof til they do its just the two of us
its you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me
but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin — yeah i would
cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so its off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that and thats why—
chorus
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

verse 3
i can never understand it thats why i dont try
from junior high until we both die its silly
oh why must we try is it really so rough
that we must always call each others billy goats gruff
try to pull each others legs until the other begs
were lyin to ourselves thats the beauty of it yeah
cause we truly love each other thats why we always fightin
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night
and its clear it aint gonna change its pentup rage
we both have we both feel like weve been upstaged
by someone else weve both been someone elses
“someone else” problem is neither one wants help
its an addiction and it cant be fixed
our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit
and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time
on every song every lyric in every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo
what you put me through fuckin whooptydo
but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up
this time cause this time girl im tellin you what
you do it again im fuckin you up
bridge
no matter what you say what you do
imma hunt you down til i find you
no matter where you run ill be right there
right behind you in your nightmares
so i brought you the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
told me you hate me you gon hate me more
when you find out you cant escape me whore

chorus
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more51embed"
