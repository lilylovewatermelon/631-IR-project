in just one sitting you left the room so i could pray
so ill pace the halls to see
if i could find a hole in something
or maybe places to escape

oh and everybody knows this is the part
of breaking down in anybodys arms
im reaching down and hoping this ones ours
god please let this take

and then i fell into pieces and she fell into me
saying play me a song its been too long since ive heard you sing

and you got here just in time
to let me know i was worth saving
if nothing more than for the hearts
too proud to breathe
but im too scared to say the things worth saying
who knew this trip would be this hard

as im looking to the sky to count the stars
i wonder if you see them where you are
im tied above my knees
and pray tomorrow brings no pain
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likeand then i fell into pieces and she fell into me
saying play me a song its been too long since ive heard you sing

and yeah we all fall to pieces
but at least you fell to me
but this is a wrong night
tell me goodnight and let it go

i stayed here and you just prayed
my head would clear and id stay safe
the pieces left that love has changed just saved everything

oh and everybody knows this is the part
of breaking down in anybodys arms
im reaching down and hoping this ones ours
god please let this take

and then i fell into pieces and she fell into me
saying play me a song its been too long since ive heard you sing
and then i fell into pieces and she fell into me
saying play me a song its been too long since ive heard you sing

and yeah we all fall to pieces
but at least you fell to me
but this is a wrong night
tell me goodnight and let it go oh1embed"
