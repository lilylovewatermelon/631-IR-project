the da is dressed to the nines
in the mirror he practices all his lines
to his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor
im guessing that he read the morning paper
the headline reads the man hangs
but the jury doesnt

prechorus 1
and everyones looking for relief
united states versus disbelief
mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle
clear your throat and face the world
the verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls
only breathing with the aid of denial

chorus
case open case shut but you could pay to close it like a casket
baby boy cant lift his headache head isnt it tragic
ohoh

postchorus
ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh

verse 2
he glances at his peers sitting seven to twelve stacked
on one to six the gallery is hushed
boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado
the city sleeps in a cell notwithstanding what we all know
hang on a rope or bated breath
whichever you prefer
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus 2
and everyones looking for relief
a bidding war for an old flames grief
the cause the kid the course the charm and the curse
not a word that could make you comprehend
too well dressed for the witness stand
the press prays for whichever headlines worse

chorus
case open case shut but you could pay to close it like a casket
baby boy cant lift his headache head isnt it tragic
ohoh

bridge
fresh pressed suit and tie unimpressed birds sing and die
can talk my way out of anything
the foreman reads the verdict in the above entitled actions
we find the defendant guilty guilty guilty guilty

chorus
case open case shut but you could pay to close it like a casket
baby boy cant lift his headache head isnt it tragic
case open case shut but you could pay to close it like a casket
baby boy cant lift his headache head isnt it tragic
ohoh
