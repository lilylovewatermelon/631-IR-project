yeah breathe in breathe out
if youre iced up pull your sleeves out
push a big truck pull your keys out
girls go wild and pull your ds out
breathe in breathe out
let them hoes fight pull a weave out
if a nigga act up pull a desert es out
when i pull the piece out niggas like peace out

verse 1 kanye west
golly more of that bullshit ice rap
i gotta pologize to mos and kweli kweli
but is it cool to rap about gold
if i told the world i copped it from ghana and mali mali
first nigga with a benz and a backpack
ice chain carti lens and a knapsack
always said if i rapped id say somethin significant
but now im rapping bout money hoes and rims again
and its still about the benjamins
bigface hundreds and whatever other synonyms
strippers named cinnamon more chips than pentium
what you gon buy next whatever new trend it is
im tryna spend my stacks and im so broke
i look back like damn was i on crack
i mean twelve platinum chains—was i on that
what the hell was wrong with me dawg
sing along with me yall

yeah breathe in breathe out ugh
if youre iced up pull your sleeves out
push a big truck pull your keys out
girls go wild and pull your ds out
breathe in breathe out
let them hoes fight pull a weave out
if a nigga act up pull a desert es out
when i pull the piece out niggas like peace out
verse 2 kanye west
now even though i went to college and dropped out of school quick
i always had a phd a pretty huge dick
ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
and giving head is like a whale thats using a toothpick
well im in the club for a limited time
act now and get some action for a freeninetynine
later on i might charge for ménage
heard her man was the boss of the floss
but she still want to toss me the drawers
and it aint gon cost me because
she my caddy cause she grab my golf balls in the club
and im still acting calm than a muh
she asked can you drive me in the hundreds where my altima was
while we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
baby i fully understand let me help you with a plan
while he tricking off dont get no rich nigga
give me some head—thatll really piss him off
chorus ludacris
yeah breathe in breathe out
if youre iced up pull your sleeves out
push a big truck pull your keys out
girls go wild and pull your ds out
breathe in breathe out
let them hoes fight pull a weave out
if a nigga act up pull a desert es out
when i pull the piece out niggas like peace out

verse 3 kanye west
i blow past lowclass niggas with no cash
in a fourdashsix bitch you can go ask
so when i go fast popo just laugh
right until i run out of gas or til i go crash
whatever comes first im prepared for the worst
whatever comes second ill be there with my weapon
pulling up in the lexuses one on both hand
so i guess them gsses was ambidextrous
couldve sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
k i need a free handmammogram
i got weed drink and a handicam
all of which is legal in amsterdam
so say my name like candyman
and ima come and fix you up like the handyman
but if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
you cant take that all at one time—you gotta breathe
chorus ludacris
yeah breathe in breathe out
if youre iced up pull your sleeves out
push a big truck pull your keys out
girls go wild and pull your ds out
breathe in breathe out
let them hoes fight pull a weave out
if a nigga act up pull a desert es out
when i pull the piece out niggas like peace out
