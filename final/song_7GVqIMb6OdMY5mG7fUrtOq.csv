verse 1 mike shinoda chester bennington both
ive been diggin into crates ever since i was livin in space
before the rat race before monkeys had human traits oohoohooh
mastered numerology and big bang theology
performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
invented the mic so i could start blessin it
and chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist
many men have tried to shake us
but i twist mic chords to doublehelixes
and show them what im made of
i buckle knees like leg braces
cast the spell of instrumentalness on all of the mcs that hate us
so try on try it leave you without a shoulder to cry on
from now to infinity let icons be bygones
i firebomb ghostly notes haunt this
i tried threats but moved on to a promise
i stomp shit with or without an accomplice
mixed media the stamp of approval is on this

verse 2 mike shinoda chester bennington both
akira
put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
never satisfy my rhyme jones
spraying bright day over what you might say
blood type krylon technicolor type a
on highways bright with road rage
im patient to win the cage and the tin to bounce all around
in surround sound devouring the scene
subliminal gangrene paintings overall the same thing
singsong karaoke copy madness
break bones verbally with sticksandstone tactics
fourth dimension combat convention
write rhymes at ease while the tracks stands at attention tention
meant to put you away with the pencil pistol official
sixteenline rhyme missile
while you risk your all i pick out of your flaws
spittin raw blah blah blah you can say you saw
