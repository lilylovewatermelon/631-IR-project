i remember when it all first began
we were tight right from the start
it wasnt long before you came on strong
trying hard to win my heart try to win it
i played hard to get
but i couldnt help but give up my heart in the end
you were thoughtful
careful not to hurt the relationship

prechorus
what happened to those days
when you used to be compassionate compassionate
caring what i thought and said
so attentive a gentleman
now its hard to turn your head away from the tv set
taking me for granted lately
and frankly its gotta quit

chorus
ooh i feel underappreciated
now girls help me out if you know what im talking about
i said ooh im feeling underappreciated
for all the time and effort i have put in this commitment

verse 2
lets take it back again to the very beginning
when our love was something new
back when romance was important
not just another thing to do another thing to do
i was feeling high on loves delight
thought id never come back down
now it seems that you and me have lost our solid ground
you might also likeprechorus
after time i realized i seem to give more than i get
more than i get
funny how things seem to change after a few years commitment
used to talk for hours on end of our dreams while we lay in bed
i miss those days when you stayed awake
now you roll over and snore instead

chorus
ooh i feel underappreciated i feel
now girls help me out if you know what im talking about
i said ooh im feeling underappreciated
for all the time and effort i have put in this commitment
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ooh

bridge
i miss the nice massages
the long phone calls
and the way you talk
how itd turn me on
miss the bubble baths had the sweetest laughs
im needin those days back

chorus
ooh i feel underappreciated
now girls help me out if you know what im talking about
i said ooh im feeling underappreciated
for all the time and effort i have put in this commitment
i feel underappreciated
if you feel me sing it with me
oh come on help me out
im feeling underappreciated2embed"
