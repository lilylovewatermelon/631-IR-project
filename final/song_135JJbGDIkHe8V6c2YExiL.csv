yeah you can see the girl coming
from a mile away
shes got her big wheels turning
shes got oklahoma plates

verse 2
shes got her sun roof up
shes got her windows rolled down
and you got to feel the ground shaking
when she comes to town

chorus
yeah i am in love with the girl in the fourwheel drive
chrome steel bumpers and red step side
she has a large time in her large machine
man i wonder how she gets up in that thing
it casts a big shadow sitting in the sun
she is got it revved up rocking ready to run
and someday soon i am going to climb right up
and take a little ride in her big old truck

verse 3
shes got bucket seats fully customized
in your wildest dreams painted on the side
it was built to run she was built to show
shes got a haggard hit playing on her stereo
