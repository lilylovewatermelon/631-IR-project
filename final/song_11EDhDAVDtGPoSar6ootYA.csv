she doesnt kiss me on the mouth anymore
cause its more intimate than she thinks we should get
she doesnt look me in the eyes anymore
too scared of what shell see somebody holding me

prechorus halsey
when i wake up all alone
and im thinking of your skin
i remember i remember what you told me

chorus 1 halsey  lauren jauregui
said that were not lovers were just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched to be loved to feel anything at all
were not lovers were just strangers
with the same damn hunger
to be touched to be loved to feel anything at all
verse 2 lauren jauregui
she doesnt call me on the phone anymore
shes never listening she says its innocent
she doesnt let me have control anymore
i mustve crossed a line i mustve lost my mind
