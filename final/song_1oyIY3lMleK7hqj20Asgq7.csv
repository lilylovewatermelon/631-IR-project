could it be i was the one
that you held so deep in the night
on the back staircase
you fell to your knees with tears in your eyes

refrain
all that you suffered all the disease
you couldnt hide it hide it from me

verse 2
all alone scared in your room
would you swear theres nobody home
on the bed laying awake
as you prayed hed leave you alone

refrain
ill let the darkness swallow me whole
i need to find you need you to know

chorus
ill be your friend in the daylight again
there we will be like an old enemy
like the salt and the sea

verse 3
and they wrote all these prescriptions
they wrote me off like a heel
yeah the doctors with their medicine
left me to rock in my filth
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likerefrain
from the destruction out of the flame
you need a villain give me a name

chorus
ill be your friend in the daylight again
there we will be like an old enemy
ill be your friend in the daylight again
there we will be like an old enemy
like the salt and the sea
like the salt and the seaembed"
