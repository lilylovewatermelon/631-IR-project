shes going out to forget they were together
all that time he was taking her for granted
she wants to see if theres more
than he gave shes looking for
he calls her up hes trippin on the phone now
he doesnt want her out there and alone now
he knows shes movin it knows shes using it
now hes losing it she dont care

chorus
everybody put up your hands
say i dont wanna be in love i dont wanna be in love
feel the beat now if youve got nothing left
say i dont wanna be in love i dont wanna be in love

say i dont wanna be in love i dont wanna be in love
feelin good now dont be afraid to get down
say i dont wanna be in love i dont wanna be in love
verse 2
he was always giving her attention
working hard to find the things she mentioned
he was dedicated by most suckers hated
that girl was fine but she didnt appreciate him
she calls him up shes trippin on the phone now
he had to get out and he aint comin home now
hes trying to forget her thats how he got with her
when he first met her when they first got together

we break up its something that we do now
everyone has got to do it sometime

stop what youre doing you dont wanna ruin
the chance that you got to find a new one
