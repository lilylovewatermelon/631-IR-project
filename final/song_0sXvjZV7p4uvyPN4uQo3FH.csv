verse 1
whats my problem
well i want you to follow me down to the bottom
underneath the insane asylum
keep your wits about you while you got em
cause your wits are first to go while youre problemsolvin
and my problem
we glorify those even more when they
my opinion our culture can treat a loss like its a win
and right before we turn on them
we give em the highest of praise
and hang their banner from the ceiling
communicating further engraving
an earlier grave is an optional way no

neon gravestones try to call for my bones neon gravestones try to call

whats my problem
dont get it twisted
its with the people we praise who may have assisted
i could use the streams and extra conversations
i could give up and boost up my reputation
i could go out with a bang
they would know my name
they would host and post a celebration
my opinion will not be lenient
my opinion its real convenient
our words are loud but now im talking action
we dont get enough love
well they get a fraction
they say how could he go if hes got everything
ill mourn for a kid but wont cry for a king

if i lose to myself
you wont mourn a day
and youll move onto someone else
promise me this
if i lose to myself
you wont mourn a day
and youll move onto someone else

cause they wont get them
no they wont get them
they wont get them
but they wont get them

verse 3
dont get me wrong the rise in awareness
is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
but for sake of discussion in spirit of fairness
could we give this some room for a new point of view
and could it be true that some could be tempted
to use this mistake as a form of aggression
a form of succession
a form of a weapon
thinking ill teach them
well im refusing the lesson
it wont resonate in our minds
im not disrespecting what was left behind
just pleading that it does not get glorified
maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
find your grandparents or someone of age
pay some respects for the path that they paved
to life they were dedicated
now that should be celebrated168embed"
