we had love so strong my heart couldnt take it
you took it in your hands and resuscitated
you said me and you against the world
you said you and me forever girl
i felt every cell fall in love with you but

prechorus
i watched you slip slip away no explanation
you on your phone your laptop and your playstation
i stared at the diamond on my finger and i waited
but the truth never came but i know her name so see you later

chorus
no i wont miss you i wont cry i dont regret it
no i wont stand for it no i dont need confetti
and you can treat another to your lies youll never get it
id rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
id rather walk alone id rather walk alone
id rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

verse 2
you hurt my pride part of me died but all of thats ego
and the house we lived in had no doors and it had no windows
you said im hangin with the boys
you said workin late to pay our bills
but i found lipstick on your collar wasnt my color

i watched you slip slip away no explanation
you on your phone your laptop and your playstation
i stared at the diamond on my finger and i waited
but the truth never came but i know her name so see you later

chorus
no i wont miss you i wont cry i dont regret it
no i wont stand for it no i dont need confetti
and you can treat another to your lies youll never get it

id rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
no i wont miss you i wont cry i dont regret it
no i wont stand for it no i dont need confetti
and you can treat another to your lies youll never get it
