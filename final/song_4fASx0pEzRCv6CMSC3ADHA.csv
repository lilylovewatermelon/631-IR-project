i believe that love and trust are one in the same
i dont think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them
that blind trust that beyond a shadow of a doubt
no matter what this person saying that person
you believe your man
now you say you love me
but every time one of your little friends come at you with something
we gotta do this
mama im trying im trying to show you that im for real
tell me what i gotta do to show you that im for you
just shut up and listen

verse 1 jennifer hudson
two hundred and sixteen
thats how many times that i went
back and forth about it in my mind
could she could she really be
who hes telling me that she is
theres something about it
that dont feel right

bridge 1 jennifer hudson  neyo
saturday she called here 26 times
oh you counted
you kept telling me not to worry
dont worry bout it
wanna believe that youre telling the truth
so dont doubt it
but if you are lying to me

verse 2 neyo
baby now hold up
lets just settle down

oh i wont deny
that everything in my body
