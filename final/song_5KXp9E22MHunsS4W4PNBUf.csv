ive been waiting patiently
i built this tower quietly
and when my well of wellbutrin is
running dry of serotonin
i can say things i dont mean
or maybe its the truth in me
i feel it building bubbling up
my tttime is up

prechorus
im so mis misunderstood un
but i live for this der my moneys good stood
and i came to win mis so step on up un
and i promise you

chorus
only one of us gon make it out alive and its not you cutthroat
only one of us
only one of us gon make it out alive and its not you cutthroat
only one of us
only one of us gon make it out alive

verse 2
ive been making my gethsemane
since i was young my ancestry cutthroat
was marching martyrdom across the
radadada dumbla plains of utah cutthroat
i cant lie ive been played
by powerful pеople who get their way
but i in timе will climb my mountain
i in time will rise
