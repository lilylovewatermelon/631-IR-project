for a thousand days
youve been staring away
are you phased
or are you thinking
crack a smile and wave
it doesnt scare me away
hit the brakes
i feel like cruising with you too

chorus
so i gaze in your eyes
and i wonder
can you take me on
your haze that im under
come wake me up soon

verse 2
take a bow and wave
as youre carried away
it was great
but im not leaving
crack a smile and wave
it still doesnt scare me away
hit the brakes
i feel like cruising with you to you
you might also likechorus
so i gaze in your eyes
and i wonder
can you take me on
your haze that im under
come wake me up

for a thousand days
we could get carried away
are you in are you in
are you in are you in
im anxious
and i feel like cruising with you

chorus
so i gaze in your eyes
and i wonder
can you take me on
your haze that im under
come to wake

so i gaze in your eyes
and i want her can you take me on5embed"
