do you remember we were standing here a year ago
our minds were racing and time went slow
if there was trouble in the world we didnt know
if we had a care it didnt show
but now i worry our horizons bear nothing new
cause i get this feeling and maybe you get it too
were on a rollercoaster stuck on its loopdeloop
cause what we did one day on a whim
has slowly become all we do

chorus
i never wanted any other way to spend our lives
i know we promised wed be doing this til we die
and now i fear we might
ooh now i fear we might

postchorus
but its okay
i think theres a way
why dont we just say one more year one more year
not worryin if i get the right amount of sleep one more year
not carin if we do the same thing every week one more year
of livin like im only livin for me one more year
of never talkin about where were gonna be one more year
one more year
of livin like the free spirit i wanna be
you might also likebridge
we got a whole year one more year
fiftytwo weeks
seven days each
one more year four seasons one reason one way
one year one more year one year
one year from today
from today

outro
i never wanted any other way to spend our lives
now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
for all time
one more year8embed"
