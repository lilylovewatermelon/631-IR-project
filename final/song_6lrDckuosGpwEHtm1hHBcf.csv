slow it down some no split clown bum
your gold hits sound dumb hold it now crown em
where you found them at
got em round town couldve drowned in it
would have floated bloated voted
sugarcoated loaded hip shooter
draw for the poor free coffee at the banks
hit through the straw none more for me thanks
that blanks the raw that dank sure stank lit
sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
crank it on blast roll past front street
blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
these kids is too fast juiced off a junk treat
who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat

chorus 2d
something has started today
where did it go what you want it to be
well you know november has come
when its gone away
oh what they say
something has started today
where did it go what you want it to be
well you know november has come
when its gone away

bah can you dig it like a spigot
my guess is yes you can like can i kick it wicked
liquor shot if you happy and you know it
as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin
grope a pen and im in cope hymen
doper rhymin more worther than the hope diamond
acquired off the black market
a wire tappin couldnt target a jar of spit
the rapidfire spark lit
zzzt a rapper bug zapper
and it dont matter after if theys a thug or dapper
plug your trap or its maximum exposure
the beats got family members askin him for closure
aw send em a gun and tell em clean it
then go get the nun who said her son didnt mean it
she wore a filledin thong of billabong
that said nah foreala the villain on a gorilla jawn

chorus 2d
something has started today
where did it go what you want it to be
well you know november has come
when its gone away
something has started today
where did it go what you want it to be
well you know november has come
when its gone away
