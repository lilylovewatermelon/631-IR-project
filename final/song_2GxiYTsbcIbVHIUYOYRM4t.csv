waiting for the sunlight
to come rising from the sea
we lay undercover
shaded by the mango tree

we could stay forever
never leave this paradise
swaying in the ocean breeze
to the rhythm of the tide

prechorus zac brown
tomorrow oh tomorrow
take your time ‘cause we got
time to borrow

chorus zac brown
i love you
say that you love me too
we can turn the whole world upside down
just us two
nobody else will do
‘cause baby you’re the only one for me
underneath the mango tree

verse 2 sara bareilles
drifting like the ocean
daydreams dancing in the wind
sand is sticking to our bodies
just like sugar on our skin
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likethe day is getting older
oh but we are still so young
higher than the stars above
and faded like the sun

prechorus zac brown and sara bareilles
tomorrow oh tomorrow
take your time ‘cause we got
time to borrow

chorus zac brown and sara bareilles
i love you
say that you love me too
and we can turn the
whole world upside down
just us two
nobody else will do
‘cause baby you’re the
only one for me
oh you are so sweet
underneath the mango tree

i love you
i know you do
say that you love me too
and we can turn the
whole world upside down
just us two
nobody else will do
‘cause baby you’re the
only one for me
baby you are the only one for me
underneath the mango treeembed"
