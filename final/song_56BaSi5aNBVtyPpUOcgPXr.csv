verse 3 pitbull
im the mailman i deliver
take her to dinner conversate a little
then i split her down the middle like miamis river
i like my women one up one down
kerry kittles heres a riddle
whats the opposite of walk run
whats the opposite of go come
that means i hit it i run you come
fe fi fo fun tear the club up
all my sexy ladies that came to lose their minds
put you hands up high tear the club up
she aint looking for a man
she just looking for a really good time
thats right tear the club up
lets drink that voli
and forget what we doing tonight
tear the club up
i aint trying to be your lover for life
just your lover tonight thats right

oh oh come on girl get loose
