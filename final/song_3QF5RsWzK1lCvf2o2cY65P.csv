dear reader if it feels like a trap
youre already in one
dear reader get out your map
pick somewhere and just run
dear reader burn all the files
desert all your past lives
and if you dont recognize yourself
that means you did it right

chorus
never take advice from someone whos falling apart
never take advice from someone whos falling apart you should find another

verse 2
dear reader bend when you can
snap when you have to
dear reader you dont have to answer
just cause they asked you
you should find another
dear reader the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
dear reader when you aim at the devil
make sure you dont miss

chorus
never take advice from someone whos falling apart
never take advice from someone whos falling apart

so i wander through these nights
i prefer hiding in plain sight
my fourth drink in my hand
these desperate prayers of a cursed man
spilling out to you for free
but darling darling please
you wouldnt take my word for it if you knew who was talking
if you knew where i was walking
to a house not a home all alone cause nobodys there
where i pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
no one sees when you lose when youre playing solitaire

outro
you should find another guiding light guiding light
but i shine so bright
you should find another guiding light guiding light
but i shine so bright
you should find another you should find another guiding light
find another you should find another
you should find another12embed"
