just a girl born in dixie
washed in the blood
and raised on the banks
of the mississippi mud
she always had a thing
about falling in love with a bad boy

yeah they could see it all coming
but her daddy never dreamed
shed grow up that fast
you know what i mean
the way a girl gets
when she turns 17
kind of crazy

prechorus
shes a rebel child
and a preachers daughter
she was baptized in dirty water
her mama cried the first time
they caught her with me
they knew they couldnt stop her

chorus
she holds tight to me and the bible
on the back seat of my motorcycle
left her daddy standing there
preaching to the choir
you see god love her
oh me and god love her

she kissed her mama goodbye
said ill be sure n phone you
she called from a truck stop
in tucson arizona
with amazing grace
we made california line
and then my gypsy life
started taking its toll
and the fast lane got empty
and out of control
and just like an angel
she saved my soul from the devil

prechorus
shes a rebel child
and a preachers daughter
she was baptized in dirty water
her mama cried the first time
they caught her with me
they knew they couldnt stop her

chorus
she holds tight to me and the bible
on the back seat of my motorcycle
left her daddy standing there
preaching to the choir
you see god love her
oh me and god love her
chorus
now she holds tight to me and the bible
on the back seat of my motorcycle
left her daddy standing there
preaching to the choir
you see god love her
oh me and god love her
god love her
me and god love her1embed"
