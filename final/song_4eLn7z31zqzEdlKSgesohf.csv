oh you win its your show now
so whats it going to be
cause people will tune in
how many train wrecks do we need to see
before we lose touch oh
and we thought this was low
well its bad getting worse so

chorus
whered all the good people go
ive been changing channels
i dont see them on the tv shows
whered all the good people go
we got heaps and heaps of what we sow

verse 2
they got this and that with a rattle a tat
testing one two man whatcha gonna do
bad news misused got too much to lose
give me some truth now whose side are we on
whatever you say
turn on the boobtube im in the mood to obey
so lead me astray
and by the way now

whered all the good people go
ive been changing channels
i dont see them on the tv shows
whered all the good people go
we got heaps and heaps of what we sow

bridge
sitting around feeling far away
so far away but i can feel the debris
can you feel it
you interrupt me from a friendly conversation
to tell me how great its all going to be
you might notice some hesitation
because its important to you its not important to me
but way down by the edge of your whole reason
well its beginning the show
and all i really want to know is

chorus
whered all the good people go
ive been changing channels
i dont see them on the tv shows
whered all the good people go
we got heaps and heaps of what we sow
outro
whered all the good people go
they got this and that with a rattle a tat
testing one two man whatcha gonna do
bad news misused give me some truth
you got too much to lose
now whose side are we on today anyway
whered all the good people go
okay whatever you say
wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
station to station desensitizing the nation
whered all the good people go
going going gone12embed"
