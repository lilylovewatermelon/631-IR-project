cmon baby lay back down
you dont have to leave right now
anything you got down town can wait
i love those high heel shoes
everything looks good on you
you make it look brand new everyday

chorus
ive got it in a bad way
i want to kiss your sweet face
and lay like this forever
i need you to need me
complete my world
i got it for you girl

verse 2
baby i can hear your breathe
whisper softly on my chest
and i can feel your sweat all over me
the sheets stuck to your skin
you give me that want to grin
baby i want to again

chorus
ive got it in a bad way
i want to kiss your sweet face
and lay like this forever
i need you to need me
complete my world
i got it for you girl

everything you dreamed of
just lay right here and sleep on
never going to have to want again
i got it for you girl
oh i need you to need me
complete my world
i got it for you
want to give it to you
i got it for you girlembed"
