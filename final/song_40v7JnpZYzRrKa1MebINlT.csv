turn down the lights and turn up the ac
hold me close when it gets cold
stuck in between lovin and lonely
stuck in between lines on the road

and it might have been the whiskey
might have been the wine
might have been the moonshine
in her eyes
it might have been bad luck
it might have been love
or maybe just a good time
it probably was

verse 2
wake up scared at six in the morning
reach out to see if youre still there
and these motel rooms are always the same scene
i remember a time when i still cared

chorus
and it might have been the whiskey
it might have been the wine
it might have been the moonshine
in her eyes
and it might have been bad luck
it might have been love
or maybe just a good time
it probably was
