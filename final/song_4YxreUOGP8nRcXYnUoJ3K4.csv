when you call she doesnt answer
when you write she doesnt answer
you go out you see him with her
she told you she was sick at home
the ring you gave her
thrown away with all the letters
and when you see him with her
he doesnt even care at all
and she follows him around like you follow her around
and he doesnt even care and you figure it out
the only way youre going to keep somebody around
well im about to let you know

chorus
theres something i dont want to understand
the only way a womans going to want a man
the only way youll ever keep her in your hands
is breaking apart her heart
dont tell her shes the reason that you live
dont give her everything that youve got to give
if you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
just break it apart her heart

verse 2
cant you see the way shes crying
well thats what keeps her trying
she knew that she could have you
and he dont give her what she wants
theres truth about this
you say you want to be noticed
well if you want to be noticed
you got to learn to break some hearts
