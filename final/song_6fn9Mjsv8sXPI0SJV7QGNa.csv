theres a cabin in a valley
my grandpa built on your land
your mountains are a canvas
for the makers hand
tonight im fishing elk river
if only in my mind
no i havent seen her banks in such a long long time
i carry you in my heart
your memory comes over me like the dark and

chorus
like a phone call from my baby
saying honey i miss ya like crazy
like the sound of a siren song
oh carolina ya keep calling me home
calling me home

verse 2
sometimes i grow weary
from going all the time
i love to take a minute
let you ease my mind
id love to see my mama
maybe go for a drive
but i got to play the star in some little town again tonight
dont get me wrong
i love what i do
its just another song about missing you
