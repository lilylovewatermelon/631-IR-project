when the day begins all the guilt sinks in
and i look on the wreckage of the night
though i try to break free the cycle breaks me
am i ever gonna see the light
all the friends ive lost and the pain ive caused
have never been enough just to make me stop
the lines i draw to look at myself
are turning into somebody else

prechorus
i know how this will end
but im starting up again
turned around inside out
cause this way

chorus
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
it beats me up
when i go there i know i could start again
when i go there oh no here we go again
takes me nowhere oh no here we go again
it beats me up
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeverse 2
open on this scene a familiar dream
of you telling me what i already know
though the truth seems near you cant get there from here
but you sure know where youre gonna go
as the rumor wind blows my infamy grows
seein friends above and i hit another low
the picture i paint to look at myself
is turning into somebody else

prechorus
i know how this will end
but im starting up again
turned around inside out
cause this way

chorus
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
it beats me up
when i go there i know i could start again
when i go there oh no here we go again
takes me nowhere oh no here we go again
it beats me up
guitar solo
ah ah

prechorus
but today if i change
and stop digging my own grave
i will try to set things right
cause this way

chorus
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
takes me nowhere i cant cant see a way out
it beats me up
when i go there i know i could start again
when i go there oh no here we go again
takes me nowhere oh no here we go again
it beats me up
