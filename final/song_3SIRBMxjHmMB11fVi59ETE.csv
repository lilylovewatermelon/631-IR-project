lay dazed in liula
dreaming of tropical signs
as lejos lay sleeping
she knelt over him weeping
feeling the weight of his crimes
it seems he cut a man down in a tennessee town
hes just licking his wounds for a spell
but it wont take long for the boys to catch on
and soon hell be running like hell

run lejos run
this aint no time for that ball and chain
run lejos run
climb on that pony and ride like you aint never done

well their love it was long
it was gentle and strong
and for a while she forgot his sins
and she kissed him for love
she kissed him for luck
she kissed him one time for a kid
well they came in without a warning
in the hours before morning
they comea blasting through the windows and walls
when the smoke it did clear
somebody cried out he aint here
killed ourselves a woman thats all
you might also likerun lejos run
this aint no time for that ball and chain
run lejos run
you climb on that pony and ride like you aint never done
ride like you aint never done2embed"
