i didnt have to turn my head whenever you walked in
the only one to let these chills roll down my skin
my heart beats faster i hear your name
i feel my confidence slippin away

chorus
i thought i was doing fine
bout to get you off my mind
i see your face and then im
wrapped around your pretty little finger again

verse 2
it feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
i see no good reason but still im tangled in your charms
my god youre smiling and you catch my eye
my heart is pounding deep inside

chorus
i thought i was doing fine
bout to get you off my mind
i see your face and then im
wrapped around your pretty little finger again

verse 3
aint gonna let no man go down without a fight
cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
my heart beats faster i call your name
i feel my confidence slippin away

i thought i was doing fine
bout to get you off my mind
i see your face and then im
wrapped around your pretty little finger again

your pretty little finger
baby im wrapped around your pretty little finger
