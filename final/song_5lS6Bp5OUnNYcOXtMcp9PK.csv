first i climb up out the sewer then i roll in like killua
while you work on being cooler me and my boys pullin maneuvers
say your crew is full of shooters you and your friends are fuckin losers
wanna be just like them rappers bust some guns and pour them deuces
you home drinking chemicals im smoking pressing juices
a young max gerson all im taking in is nutrients
if i hear some words that i dont like ill find out who he is
put the pieces all together now we go and do this shit

prechorus
i aint kickin through the front i aint runnin through the back
you dont gotta worry where i am cause bones know where you at
i aint kickin through the front i aint runnin through the back
you dont gotta worry where i am cause bones know where you at

chorus
i know where you at i know where you be
i know where you at i know where you sleep
i know where you at i know where you be
i know where you sleepyou might also like8embed"
