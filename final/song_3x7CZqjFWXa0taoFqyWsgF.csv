my little mexican woman
got herself a hot little body whistle
that little sweet senorita
knows how to be the life of the party
we dance and we talk
hold hands when we walk
shoot tequilla all night long
she cant understand
why this rambling man
says its time to be moving on
my little sweet georgia peach
she sure knows how to show me a good time
shes got the longest legs
i swear theyre smoother than her daddys moonshine thats smooth
we eat her mamas fried chicken
go skinny dipping
drink cold beer all night long
she cant understand
when this rambling man
says its time to be moving on

chorus
i got places to be
i got people to see
got both ends of the candle to burn
but ill try to hurry
so girls dont you worry
i promise you shall return
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 2
my little miami friend
with that cinnamon skin lord shes so fine sure is
she always lights up my night
with a ray of pure florida sunshine
man we work on our tans
roll around in the sand
chug bacardi all night long
she dont understand
when this rambling man
says its time to be moving on

chorus
i got places to be
i got people to see
got both ends of the candle to burn
but ill try to hurry
so girls dont you worry
i promise you shall return

i got places to be
i got people to see
got both ends of the candle to burn
but ill try to hurry
so girls dont you worry
i promise you shall return
outro
no dont worry girls i shall returnembed"
