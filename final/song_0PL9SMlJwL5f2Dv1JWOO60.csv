well the fire in your blood is showin through your eyes
the evil in your bones is takin its time
and your head told your heart it had enough today
anitas dead upstairs with the dreams on the way
and i remember you when you left this town
but sing of love and codeine with you around
you left here and found the world was cold
now youre in my arms and youll never grow old

chorus
anita anita i dont wanna need ya
but i see you when its dark and im alone
anita anita i came upstairs to feed ya
they warned me about detoxing at home
you will always be the most gorgeous girl i know

verse 2
i pray sweet girl you finally made it home
cause you left in a room with your dreams alone
if ive learned a thing about this life
its that the evil only comes when youre tryna do right

chorus
anita anita i dont wanna need ya
but i feel you when its dark and im alone
anita anita i came upstairs to feed ya
they warned me about detoxing at home
you will always be the most gorgeous girl i know
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likebridge
you came runnin for help this time
but the worlds never fair to the hopeful kind

chorus
anita anita i dont wanna need ya
but i see you when its dark and im alone
anita anita i came upstairs to feed ya
they warned me about detoxing at home
you will always be the most gorgeous girl i know

outro
well the fire in your blood is showin through your eyes
the evil in your bones is takin its timeembed"
