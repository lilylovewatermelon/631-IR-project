as i live and breathe
im watching watching a world die
we greet this with apathy
no longer

verse 1
consumed by self
we walk through each day
with no mind for deprivation
and moral decay
we must destroy and rebuild
we must destroy and rebuild
for the sake of all
it starts with one
with one

refrain
as i live and breathe
im watching watching a world die
we greet this with apathy
no longer

chorus
if we cant break the silence how can we survive
search inside yourself and know that youre alive
we must break the silence
now we are alive
silent no longer

make this world take notice
that change is in our hands
the battle has just begun
we are not defeated

chorus
if we cant break the silence how can we survive
search inside yourself and know that youre alive
we must break the silence
now we are alive
silent no longer

bridge
with all that i am
i will lift my voice
to start this revolution
it starts today
and it starts with me
silent no longer
with all i am i will lift my voice
with all i am
it starts with me

outro
break the silence break the silence
break the silence
we are alive
break the silence break the silence
break the silence
we are alive1embed"
