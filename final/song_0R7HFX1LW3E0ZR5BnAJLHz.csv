i have come curiously close to the end though
beneath my selfindulgent pitiful hole
defeated
i concede and move closer
i may find comfort here
i may find peace within the emptiness
how pitiful
its calling me calling me
its calling me calling me
its calling me calling me
its calling me

verse 2
and in my darkest moment fetal and weeping
the moon tells me a secret a confidant
as full and bright as i am
this light is not my own and
a million light reflections pass over me
the source is bright and endless
she resuscitates the hopeless
without her we are lifeless satellites drifting
and as i pull my head out i am without one doubt
dont want to be down here soothing my narcissism i
must crucify the ego before its far too late
i pray the light lifts me out
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likerefrain
before i pine away pine away
before i pine away pine away
before i pine away pine away
before i pine away

verse 3
so crucify the ego before its far too late
and leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
and you will come to find that we are all one mind
capable of all thats imagined and all conceivable
so let the light touch you so that the words spill through
and let the past break through bringing out our hope and reason

refrain
before we pine away pine away
before we pine away pine away
before we pine away pine away
before we pine away24embed"
