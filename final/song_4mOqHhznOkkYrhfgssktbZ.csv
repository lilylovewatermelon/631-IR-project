bike down
down to the downtown
down to the lock down
boards nails lie around

chorus
i crouch like a crow
contrasting the snow
for the agony id rather know
cause blinded
i am blindsided

verse 2
peek in
into the peer in
im not really like this
im probably plightless

chorus
i cup the window
im crippled and slow
for the agony id rather know
cause blinded
i am blindsided

would you really rush out
would you really rush out
would you really rush out for me now
would you really rush out
would you really rush out for me now
would you really rush out for me now
would you really rush out for me now
would you really rush out for me now
ooh ooh for me now
ooh ooh for me now

verse 3
taut line
down to the shoreline
the end of a blood line
the moon is a cold light

chorus
theres a pull to the flow
my feet melt the snow
for the irony id rather know
cause blinded
i was blindsided
blinded
i was blindsided
blinded
i was blindsided11embed"
