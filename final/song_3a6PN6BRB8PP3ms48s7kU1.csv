verse 1 2d
oh joys arise the sun has come again to hold you
sailing out the doldrums of the week
the polyphonic prayer is here its all around you
its all around you out here

bridge 2d
and if the whole world is crashing down on you
fall through space out of mind with me

verse 2 2d
where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
blows all the shadows far away
the falling of the whole empire is here to hold you
rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

instrumental break

chorus yukimi nagano
little memories marching on
your little feet working the machine

my little dream working the machine
soon like a wave empires will fall
and closing in on you theyre going on
