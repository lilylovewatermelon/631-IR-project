i dont feel the joy
i dont feel the pain
you were just a toy
i am just insane
walking on my own
leaving you behind
you were crying out
that you need to speak your mind

chorus
oh so alone in love
so alone in love
im going to haunt you everyday
haunt you everyday

verse 2
i am gonna kill
when i need a thrill
eating at the heart
until ive had my fill
when will stupid learn
fires gonna burn
think of consequence
then you move when its your turn
see weezer liveget tickets as low as 225you might also likechorus
oh so alone in love
so alone in love
im going to haunt you everyday
haunt you everyday

walking on my own
leaving you behind
you are crying out

oh so alone in love
so alone in love
im going to haunt you everyday
haunt you everyday
