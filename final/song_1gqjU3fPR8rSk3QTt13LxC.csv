you touch these tired eyes of mine
and map my face out line by line
and somehow growing old feels fine
listen close for im not smart
you wrap your thoughts in works of art
and theyre hanging on the walls of my heart

prechorus
i may not have the softest touch
i may not say the words as such
and though i may not look like much im yours

chorus
and though my edges may be rough
i never feel im quite enough
it may not seem like very much but im yours

verse 2
you healed these scars over time
embraced my soul you loved my mind
youre the only angel in my life
the day news came my best friend died
my knees went weak and you saw me cry
say im still the soldier in your eyes
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likeprechorus
i may not have the softest touch
i may not say the words as such
and though i may not look like much im yours

chorus
and though my edges may be rough
i never feel im quite enough
it may not seem like very much but im yours

prechorus repeated
i may not have the softest touch
i may not say the words as such
i know i dont fit in that much but im yours3embed"
