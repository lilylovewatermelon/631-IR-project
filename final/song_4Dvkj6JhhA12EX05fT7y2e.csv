come on harry we wanna say goodnight to you

verse 1
holdin me back
gravitys holdin me back
i want you to hold out the palm of your hand
why dont we leave it at that
nothin to say
when everything gets in the way
seems you cannot be replaced
and im the one who will stay ohohoh

chorus
in this world its just us
you know its not the same as it was
in this world its just us
you know its not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know its not the same

verse 2
answer the phone
harry youre no good alone
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of pills are you on
ringin the bell
and nobodys coming to help
your daddy lives by himself
he just wants to know that youre well ohohoh
