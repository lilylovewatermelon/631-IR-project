whispered something in your ear
it was a perverted thing to say
but i said it anyway
made you smile and look away

chorus
nothings gonna hurt you baby
as long as youre with me youll be just fine
nothings gonna hurt you baby
nothings gonna take you from my side

verse 2
when we dance in my living room
to that silly 90s rb
when we have a drink or three
always ends in a hazy shower scene

chorus
nothings gonna hurt you baby
as long as youre with me youll be just fine
nothings gonna hurt you baby
nothings gonna take you from my side

bridge
when we laugh into the microphone and sing
with our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
when were laughing in the microphone and singing
with our sunglasses on to our favorite songs

nothings gonna take you from my side32embed"
