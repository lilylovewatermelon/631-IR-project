im gonna make a change for once in my life
its gonna feel real good
gonna make a difference gonna make it right
as i turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
this wind is blowin my mind
i see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
who am i to be blind pretending not to see their needs
a summers disregard a broken bottle top
and one mans soul
they follow each other on the wind ya know
cause they got nowhere to go
thats why i want you to know

chorus
im starting with the man in the mirror
im asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change
nanana nanana nana nana

verse 2
ive been a victim of a selfish kinda love
its time that i realize
there are some with no home
not a nickel to loan
could it be really me pretending that theyre not alone
a willow deeply scarred somebodys broken heart
and a washedout dream
they follow the pattern of the wind ya see
cause they got no place to be
thats why im starting with me
