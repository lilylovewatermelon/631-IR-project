the nurse should not be the one who puts salt in your wounds
but its always with trust that the poison is fed with a spoon
when youre helpless with no one to turn to alone in your room

you would swear that the one who would care for you never would leave
she promised and said you will always be safe here with me
but promises open the door to be broken to me

chorus
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down now
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down now
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down

verse 2
the maid that youve hired could never conspire to kill
shes to mother not quietly smother you when youre most ill
the one that youre trusting suspiciously dusting the sill

chorus
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down now
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you down now
no im never no im never no im never gonna let you downyou might also like2embed"
