somethings gotten into you
you dont really look at me the way you used to
and im hoping it aint true
every single rumor that ive heard of you
say you were off with someone that i dont know
callin other people on your telephone
kinda wish i didnt know

chorus
well fight or flight id rather die
than have to cry in front of you
fight or flight id rather lie
than tell you im in love with you
my eyes are welling up
as you admit theres someone new
its my move fight or flight

verse 2
you tell me it aint what it seems
but baby this is lookin like a crime scene
theres clothes thrown on the balcony
and you smell like perfume out a magazine
im throwing all your shit outta my window
telling you i wish that we had never spoke
baby i already know

well fight or flight id rather die
than have to cry in front of you
fight or flight id rather lie
than tell you im in love with you
my eyes are welling up
as you admit theres someone new
its my move fight or flight

bridge
now theres someone at my door
someone ive not met before
theyve got eyes like mine a pretty smile
and theyve been crying for a while
cause they also didnt know
that our lover loved us both

chorus
well fight or flight id rather die
than have to cry in front of you
fight or flight id rather lie
than tell you im in love with you
my eyes are welling up
as you admit theres someone new
its my move fight or flight20embed"
