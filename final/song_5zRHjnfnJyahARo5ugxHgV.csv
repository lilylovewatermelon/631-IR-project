clothes aint in the closet shoes aint under the bed
i shouldve believed her when she said what she said
youll never change i know you never will
i just sat there watching tailights rollin over the hill
i called her mama and i called her best friend
they said she called it quits so boy dont call here again
up and down these streets lookin for her car
tried to make it back home but ended up at the bar

chorus
shes gone shes gone so long never coming back
so gone so gone so gone the train went off the track
and all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put me and my baby back together again
so long shes gone so long thats the way it goes
shes gone so long so long and everybody knows
that im going crazy one night at a time
shes out of sight and im out of my mind

verse
thought i saw you down in memphis walking in the rain
i caught a glimpse of you in dallas gettin off a plane
but its all in my head what else can i do
she aint drinkin anymore so im drinkin for two

chorus
shes gone shes gone so long never coming back
so gone so gone so gone the train went off the track
and all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put me and my baby back together again
so long shes gone so long thats the way you know
shes gone so gone so gone and everybody knows
that im going crazy one night at a time
shes out of sight and im out of my mind oohh
