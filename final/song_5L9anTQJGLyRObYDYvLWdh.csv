my dreams is vivid work hard to live it
any place i visit i got land there
how can players stand there and say i sound like them hello
push wigs back and push six coupes thats yellow
plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
spray up your days inn any telly you in
crack baggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
desert es street sweepers inside the beamer wagon
i rely on bedstuy to shut it down if i die
put that on my diamond bezel youre messing with the devil what
