walking around i hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief
im trying to find a reason to live
but the mindless clutter my path
oh these thorns in my side
oh these thorns in my side
i know i have something free
i have something so alive
but i think they shoot because they want
i think they shoot because they want
i think they shoot because they want me

verse 1
i feel forces all around me
come on raise your head
those who hide behind the shadows
live with all thats dead

chorus 1
look at me look at me look at me look at me
at least look at me when you shoot
a bullet through my head
through my head through my head

verse 2
in my lifetime when im disgraced
jealousy and lies
i laugh aloud because my life
has gotten inside someone elses mind
see creed liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likechorus 1
look at me look at me look at me look at me
at least look at me when you shoot
a bullet through my head
through my head through my head

bridge
hey all i want is whats real
something i touch and can feel
ill hold it close and never let it go
said why why do we live this life
with all this hate inside
ill give it away
because i dont want it no more
please help me find a place
somewhere far away
yes ill go and youll never see me again

chorus 2
look at me look at me
at least look at me when you shoot
a bullet through my head
through my head through my head

chorus 2
look at me look at me
at least look at me when you shoot
a bullet through my head
through my head through my head
outro
look at me
look at meembed"
