when youre feeling all wrong in the back of your mind again
how does it feel
when you drop down everythings all the same
oh yeah
saccharine caffeine nicotine gum
yeah it tastes sweet but its not for long
and i just think you thought it would be
and when youre looking for truth on the cover of a magazine
how does it feel
when you found out what youre not going to be
oh yeah
they give you your image and the things you believe
open your eyes tell me what did you see
and i just think you thought it so real

chorus
and how does it feel when youre out on your own
and now its too late to go home
and its hard to be free when youre down on your knees
take it easy till you make it alone

verse 2
now youre a supermarket punk rock television comedy
out on the scene
yeah i bit down now theres no hand to feed
oh yeah
and all the beautiful images lining your walls
pop radio screaming down the halls
now you think you found something real
when its all about money and the things that you need
live a big lie and they all believe
now i just find that somehow obscene
see the goo goo dolls liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likechorus
and how does it feel when youre out on your own
and now its too late to go home
and its hard to be free when youre down on your knees
take it easy till you make it alone

bridge
take it easy till you make it alone
what a scene
yeah
when its all been said before
and all been done
take it easy till you make it alone
take it easy till you make it alone

outro
na na na na na
na na na na na x3
cause lies weigh more than truth
innocence looks good on you
now everybody wants to know your name
