we cant lose touch but we can let go
blue and white gun made from lego
all the vowels vow to hold your name
keep your estate clean of me
ive pillowed you so many times this week
close eyes open close again forget and fall asleep

chorus
the dark seeks dark
the dark seeks dark
ooooh darker
ooooh darker

postchorus
ooooh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
the nights of all my youth pressed into one glass of water

verse 2
scattered truths bewildered beast boohoos
we have our weight tenthousand ladybirds
all the vowels vow to guard your name
keep your estate clean happy
some things lie too deep for tears to well
close eyes open close again feel as my body spells

ooooh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
the shadow burns across like embers tide paper
