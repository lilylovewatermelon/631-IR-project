in pitch dark
i go walking in your landscape
broken branches
trip me as i speak

chorus
just cause you feel it
doesnt mean its there
just cause you feel it
doesnt mean its there

verse 2
theres always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
dont reach out dont reach out
dont reach out dont reach out
steer away from these rocks
wed be a walking disaster
dont reach out dont reach out
dont reach out dont reach out

chorus
just cause you feel it
doesnt mean its there
someone on your shoulder
someone on your shoulder
just cause you feel it
doesnt mean its there
someone on your shoulder
someone on your shoulder
