ive got your picture on my wall
i dream about you when i sleep
i go out of my way everyday just hoping that
ill catch you walking down your street
i know just where you went to school
i know the names of all your friends
ive got it bad again
an obsession

prechorus
i know your middle name
ive got a lock of your hair
im just a little bit insane
cause i think i see you everywhere
my friends they just dont understand
they cannot see my point of view
they say its gotten out of hand
that im obsessed with you

chorus
but i want to get next to you
yeah i love all the things you do
i want to get close to you
you are my dream come true
i want to have sex with you
your sweet caress wont do
cause im obsessed with you
cause im obsessed with you

your smile sets my heart aflame
electrocute me with your eyes
the very mention of your name
my stomach fills with butterflies
your love is better than cocaine
i need you more than oxygen
ive got it bad again
an obsession

prechorus
i know your middle name
ive got a lock of your hair
