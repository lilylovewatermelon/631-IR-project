hey nate hows life
i don’t know its alright
ive been dealin’ with some things like every human being
and really didnt sleep much last night last night
im sorry thats fine
i just think i need a little me time
i just think i need a little free time
little break from the shows and the bus rides yeah bus rides
last year i had a breakdown
thoughts tellin me im lost gettin too loud
had to see a therapist then i found out
somethin funny’s goin’ on up in my house
yeah i started thinkin maybe i should move out
you know pack my cart take a new route
clean up my yard get the noose out
hang up my heart let it air out air out
i’ve been searchin
what does that mean nate ive been learning
grabbin my keepsakes leavin’ my burdens
well i brought a few with me im not perfect
lookin at the view like this concerns me
pickin up the cues right im quite nervous
hate it when i lose sight life gets blurry
and things might hurt me
its prolly gonna be a long journey but hey but hey
its worth it though
cold world out there kids grab your coats
its been a minute i know now im back to roam
lookin for the antidote to crack the code
pretty vivid i admit it im in classic mode
dont need pity given to me but i cant condone
talkin down to me ima have to crack your nose for crackin jokes
im lookin for the map to hope you seen it you seen it
been makin a whole lot of changes
wrote a song about that you should play it
i get scared when i walk on these stages
i look at the crowd and see so many faces yeah
thats when i start to get anxious
thats when my thoughts can be dangerous
thats when i put on my makeup and drown in selfhatred
forget what im sayin and—
whered the beat go
oh aint that somethin
drums came in you aint see that comin
hands on my head cant tell me nothin
got a taste of the fame had to pump my stomach
throw it back up like i dont want it
wipe my face clean off my vomit
ocd tryna push my buttons
i said dont touch it now yall done it
i can be critical never typical
intricate with every syllable im a criminal
intimate but never political pretty visual
even if you hate it ill make it feel like youre in it though
you call me what you wanna but never call me forgettable
leave you deep in thought i could never swim in the kiddie pool
way that i been thinkin is cinematic its beautiful
man i dont know if im makin movies or music videos videos videos videos
yeah the sales can rise
doesnt mean much though when your health declines
see weve all got somethin that we trapped inside
that we try to suffocate you know hopin it dies
try to hold it underwater but it always survives
then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
you dont relate to that must not be as crazy as i am
the point im makin is the mind is a powerful place
and what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
its pretty cool right yeah but its not always safe
just hang with me thisll only take a moment okay
just think about it for a second if you look at your face
every day when you get up and think youll never be great
youll never be great—not because youre not but the hate
will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith woo
ive been developin take a look at the benefits
nothin to meddle with i can never be delicate
am i even relevant that depends how you measure it
take a measurement then bag it up and give me the evidence
pretty evident dependable can never be tentative
im a gentleman depending on if i think youre genuine
pretty elegant but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
proper etiquette i keep it to myself when i celebrate ah ah
its that time again
better grab your balloons and invite your friends
seatbelts back on yeah strap em in
look at me everybody im smilin big
on a road right now that i cant predict
tell me tone that down but i cant resist
yall know that sound better raise your fist
the search begins im back so enjoy the trip huhsee nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like290embed"
