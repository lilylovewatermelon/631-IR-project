the fame the money the cars the sexual glory that goes with all of that apparently
it was represented in this
you know the culture wave we created
is more than a lifestyle

chorus
i spend this money but its nothin to me chonies
i fuck hoes but its nothin to me hoes
designer clothes it aint nothin to me designer clothes
and i told all my day one niggas that they coming with me gang gang
tryna make a way for gang so we all can eat we all can eat
drinking red ever since they took that purple from me that act from me
stuck in bed i cant move cause this syrup on me this syrup on me
she hit the cup by accident she bout to hurl on me hurl on me

verse
every time my life get a pop make me wanna drop somethin
like lookin at my money stacked thats why the whip i aint bought one
not that i cant get one or not that i dont want one
so booked if i even got it i wouldnt have time to drive one
thinking about that laferrari bout to go and find one
had a dream about a skydweller then i woke up and went and bought one
the feelin aint the same cant explain if you aint got one
when its wrapped around your wrist i cant explain it
some people let the money change em change
and id still rather be rich than be famous
i seen it with my own eyes eyes
my brother changed up on me for dead guys
cant look em in the face cause he got red eyes red
far from i know he a demon
when i found out he was scheming
lookin at that footage gave me the red eyes couldve cried
i couldnt believe it its all good
it show who down for me down
