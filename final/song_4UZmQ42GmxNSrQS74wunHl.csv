well tell me what youre running from
she said everything and everyone
well tell me what youre running from
what youre running from
well tell me what youre running from
cause your past it cant be undone
tell me what youre running from
what youre running from

verse 1
well she wakes up every morning
her thoughts weighing heavy on her mind
shes hoping today will be a better day than the ones behind
shes having some trouble getting going
oh from the fear shes paralyzed
she puts her face into her hands and then she cries

prechorus
cause shes so tired
she closes her eyes
trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
and shes so tired
she closes her eyes
trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
oh yeah

verse 2
no hope for tomorrow no hope for today
no hope for anything that comes her way
shes so used to feeling empty inside
no reasons to live more reasons to die
at least thats what she feels inside
will she ever find the courage to change

prechorus
cause shes so tired
she closes her eyes
trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
and shes so tired
she closes her eyes
trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
oh yeah
