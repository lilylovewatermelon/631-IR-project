come on

verse 1
this is my vengeance for all the wrongs youve formed against us
you always get me wrong
my whole existence revolves around the progress that weve made
and ill never be walked on again

chorus
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road the road

verse 2
this is our triumph over all the forms of filth youve spread
well never let this go
right from the very start i knew this day would come
tonights the night we silence you theres nowhere left to run

chorus
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road the road
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likebridge
let this be your reminder
im everything that you wanted to be
hope for the best but its over
and you thought you were better than me

chorus
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road
im on the edge of the rooftop thinking nobody will ever know
i know that you want to be the one to see the distance from the road

postchorus
the road
the road
the road
the road

outro
such a pretty picture
your chalk line on the ground i hope you die2embed"
