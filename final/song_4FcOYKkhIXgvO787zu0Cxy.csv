she says
look baby im a rock star
grabs my old guitar
playin it upside down
dancin around
in front of our tv
i cant see the ballgame
so i just wave my lighter and say
yeah rock on baby
id rather watch you anyway

verse 2
but when youre done
can i come backstage
and get you to sign your name
on that zeppelin shirt of mine youre wearin
ill never wash that thing again

verse 3
yeah and shes my kinda crazy
the little games she plays
lord theyll never get old
shes too cute to get on my last nerve
the way she throws her little fits
see brantley gilbert liveget tickets as low as 38you might also likeverse 4
pokin out her lip and bitin mine when we kiss
there aint a fight that she cant win
thats my baby
and shes my kinda crazy

verse 5
you ought to see her in my pickup
shes gotta have that radio up
bless her heart she cant sit still
head in my lap bare feet on the windshield
says cmon baby let me drive

bridge 1
now honey its a stick shift
remember what you did last time
oh

verse 6
she never lets me rest
she keeps me up all night
known to roll me off the bed
and steal the covers off my side

bridge 2
but i hear wake up sleepy head
and i open up my eyes
and its all worth the while
thats my baby
and shes my kinda crazy3embed"
