you should stay real close to jesus
keep that bottle at your hand my man
find your way back to my bed again
sing me like a bible hymn
we should go back to arkansas
trade this body for the can of gin
like a little piece of heaven
no more candle in the wind

verse 1
you should come back to our place baby
dont be afraid of our love
on the second floor darling
in a second flat hurry up
cause down in arkansas the stores are all closed
the kids in their hoodies they dance super slow
were whitehot forever and only god knows

chorus
you should stay real close to jesus
keep that bottle at your hand my man
find your way back to my bed again
sing me like a bible hymn
we should go back to arkansas
trade this body for the can of gin
like a little piece of heaven
no more candle in the wind

well be whitehot forever forever forever
whitehot forever forever forever
whitehot forever
and ever and ever amen

verse 2
could i come back to the ranch baby
i had to get away for a while
just to rest my nerves darling
can i make you laugh with a smile
you knew when you chose me
i was nothing but ordinary
and now the winds blowing reminding you of what you know

chorus
you should stay real close to jesus
keep that bottle at your hand my man
find your way back to my bed again sing sing
sing me like a bible hymn
we should go back to arkansas
trade this body for that can of gin
like a little piece of heaven
no more candle in the wind

postchorus
well be whitehot forever forever forever
whitehot forever together together
whitehot forever
and ever and ever the end
whitehot forever forever forever
whitehot forever together together
whitehot forever
and ever and ever amen
outro
you should stay real close to jesus
if you dont pray youll never learn
keep that bottle at your hand my man
you know what im sayin
find your way back to my bed again
sing me like a bible hymn
we should go back to arkansas
i like living here
trade this body for the can of gin
like a little piece of heaven
no more candle in the wind39embed"
