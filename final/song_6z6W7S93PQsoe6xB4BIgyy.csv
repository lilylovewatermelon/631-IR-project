ridin down the block in a lac got a glock in my lap
as i holler where you at
no fear of attack because i know his peers aint got his back
creepin and im peepin now the tank out of gas
head home to the 7th ward the ride there was fast
at last walkin into the house i know the moment passed
then i look into the mirror noticed shattered glass
looking like a spider web caused by a blast

verse 2 lick loth
trappin out the pine box hades got the block hot
heron in my shoebox snot with the blood clot
used to sell that dope but still never had no money
slangin to fill my habits addict servin up a junkie i

he start to runnin cause i usually start to beg and plead him
to take my soul take my life take my last breath
he never did so i took his and i manifestsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like8embed"
