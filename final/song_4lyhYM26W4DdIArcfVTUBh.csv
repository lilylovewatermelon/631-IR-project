while you wait for the others to make it all worthwhile
all your useless pretensions are weighing on my time
you could beg for forgiveness as long as you like
or just wait out the evening youll only bleed me dry
yes youll only bleed me dry

prechorus
so ill ask you kindly to make your way

chorus
and what was left
a perfect cleft
we all fall through

verse 2
while you wait on the answers that ill pretend to find
keeping up with the motions still occupies our time
you could hope for some substance as long as you like
or just wait out the evening and always ask me why
yes youll only bleed me dry

prechorus
so ill ask you kindly to make your way

chorus
and what was left
a perfect cleft
we all fall through

and all we want
and what was left
and all we want
and what was left6embed"
