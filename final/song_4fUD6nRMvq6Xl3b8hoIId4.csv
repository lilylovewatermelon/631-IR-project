multicolored microbus
plowing over rugged terrain
were jacking the radio
passing the afternoon train
around the roses
she showed us hyacinths and sage
goldplated garden tools
sunlamps and its all the rage

chorus
stay low to the ground or theyll sniff you out
you never know what you will find
when you go out of the blackness
into the great big sky
supercollider
shooting inside your mind

verse 2
gather round the gas tower
dont it kinda look like a bong
i heard it backwards
hidden in a pink floyd song
stella radiata
its got to set your mind at ease
spinning on the tire swing
flying like tarzan through the trees
you might also likechorus
and back to the bus when the sun goes down
try to aim it back into town
were riding out of the blackness
into the great big sky
supercollider
shooting inside your mind
supercollider
shooting inside your mind

verse 3
and coriander grows along the banks
where we go walking at night
creeping slowly over the grounds
we tiptoe round the garden
trying not to tramp it down

chorus
stay low to the ground or theyll sniff you out
you never know what you will find
when you go out of the blackness
into the great big sky
supercollider
shooting inside your mind
supercollider
shooting inside your mindembed"
