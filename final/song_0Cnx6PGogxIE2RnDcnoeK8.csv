suck and suck
sucking up all you can
sucking up all you can suck and suck
working up under my patience like a little tick
fat little parasite
suck me dry
my fruit is bruised and borrowed
you thieving bastards
you have turned my blood cold and bitter
beat my compassion black and blue

chorus
hope this is what you wanted
hope this is what you had in mind
cause this is what youre getting
i hope youre choking
i hope you choke on this
i hope youre choking
i hope you choke on this

verse 2
taken all i can taken all i can i can take
taken all you can taken all you can we can take
got nothing left to give to you
bloodsucking parasitic little tick
bloodsucking parasitic little
bloodsucking parasitic little tick
take what you want and then go
