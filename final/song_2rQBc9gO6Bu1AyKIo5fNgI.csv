baby girl im caught up in your heatwave
youre hot like the end of june
its not like youre gonna cool off soon
the spotlight looks good on you
it looks good on you
shadows heat you like a headdress
key to my heart on your necklace
between summer girl and that sundress
im sweatin and im reckless

chorus
moon dance in the starlight
got two hands on your hips tonight
its hot as hell but its just right
let me drop a double shot in your crystal light
midnight sweat jerky skin
cant cool off on a cold even
love this love were makin baby even if its rainin
talk about a heat wave

bridge
watch your body move to the beat babe
feels like were havin us a beach day
lightin it up while your feet sway
im caught up in your heatwave
heat wave youre so fine
heat wave youre so fine
heat wave youre so fine
heat wave youre so fine
