kissing a strange hand my city like street lamps fade
on the edge of an answer you weigh lust beginnings are made
lover forgive me my guilt is my only crime
and ill carry it round til it breaks me down every time

chorus
this is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
and we can reveal who we truly are
within the darkest most depraved
of joys

if youre afraid to say but youd like to try
just give me the safe word and take your hand
and smack me in the mouth
my love

verse 2
from hunger you call and it falls upon the ears of faith
a half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would take
pretend all you want you can cry to your hearts own beat
we will take love and swear upon the things that we just cant keep

chorus
this is the time of night when the moonlight shines down
and we can reveal who we truly are
within the darkest most depraved
of joys
you might also likeif youre afraid to say but youd like to try
just give me the safe word and take your hand
and smack me in the mouth
my love
