before we took the notion to keep up with the times
and leave em all behind chisel to the paper
tattoos on the ether fadin in the light

all the while id gorge my gut come the time then i would rut
runnin high and low to find my prehistoric queen
to keep me warm til spring when id go out with my friends
graze the land and wonder when id see your face again

til the day i met my doom i took one in the boiler room
to put food on the table of a dying breed of man
once i was a broken heart and once i tore your heart apart
once my heart put out before i ever got to breathe
but my soul returned to seed and come to earth again
clucking out a livin as the favorite layin hen

til the day i met my doom a fox got in the chicken coop
doin all he knew to do to feed a hungry den

on and on down the line ive swam canals and bore the hide
of plenty births along this ride of being born again
once i was and you were too and we were both the word of truth
we built this world together with a loud and mighty bang
lord it sounded like a train and echoed oer the land
and we came up with a game to play of being born againsee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like1embed"
