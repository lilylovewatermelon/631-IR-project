got a big plan this mindset maybe its right
at the right place and right time maybe tonight
in a whisper or handshake sending a sign
wanna make out and kiss hard wait never mind
late night in passing mentioned it flipped
to her best friend its nothing maybe it slipped
but the slip turns to terror and a crush to like
then she walked in he froze up believe its the fright

verse 2
its cute in a way til you cannot speak
and you leave to have a cigarette and knees get weak
escape was just a nod and a casual wave
obsess about it heavy for the next two days
its only just a crush itll go away
its just like all the others itll go away
or maybe this is danger and he just dont know
you pray it all away but it continues to grow

chorus
i want to hold you close skin pressed against me tight
lie still close your eyes girl so lovely it feels so right
i want to hold you close soft breast beating heart
as i whisper in your ear i wanna fucking tear you apart

then he walked up and told her thinking maybe itd pass
and they talked and looked away a lot doing the dance
her hand brushed up against his she left it there
told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare
they took a step back thought about it what should they do
cause theres always repercussions when youre dating in school
but their lips met and reservations started to pass
whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

verse 4
either way he wanted her and this was bad
wanted to do things to her it was making him crazy
now a little crush turned into a like
and now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

chorus
i want to hold you close skin pressed against me tight
lie still close your eyes girl so lovely it feels so right
i want to hold you close soft breast beating heart
as i whisper in your ear i wanna fucking tear you apart

instrumental break

chorus
i want to hold you close skin pressed against me tight
lie still close your eyes girl so lovely it feels so right
i want to hold you close soft breast beating heart
as i whisper in your ear i wanna fucking tear you apart
i want to hold you close skin pressed against me tight
lie still close your eyes girl so lovely it feels so right
i want to hold you close soft breast beating heart
as i whisper in your ear i wanna fucking tear you apart30embed"
