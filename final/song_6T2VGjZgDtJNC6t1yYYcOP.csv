a daydream spills from my corked head
breaks free of my wooden neck
left to nod over sleeping waves
like bobbing bait for bathing cod
floating flocks of candled swans
slowly drift across wax ponds

chorus ryan ross  brendon urie
the men all played along to marching drums
and boy did they have fun behind the sea
they sang hey so our matching legs are marching clocks
and were all too small to talk to god
yes were all too smart to talk to god

verse 2 ryan ross
toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
to us from the dock
jinxed things ringing as they leak
through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
scarecrow now its time to hatch
sprouting suns and ageless daughters

prechorus brendon urie brendon urie  ryan ross
dont you know dont you know
that those watermelon smiles
just cant ripen underwater
just cant ripen underwater

the men all played along to marching drums
and boy did they have fun behind the sea
they sang hey
so our matching legs are marching clocks
and were all too small to talk to god
yeah were all too smart to talk to god
oh were all too smart to talk to god

bridge all
oh legs of wood waves
waves of wooden legs yeah
waves of wooden legs
legs of wood waves
waves of wooden legs
waves of wooden legs
legs of wood waves
waves of wooden legs
waves of wooden legs
legs of wood waves
waves of wooden legs
waves of wooden legs
