it must have been a year since
i was thrown across an ocean far from home
life is making no sense
riding in between the highs and lows

prechorus
woah when i wake in the morning i ooh
its the first on my mind

chorus
maybe what i miss most
it wasnt made of steel and stone
and maybe what i miss most
it wasnt born of skin and bone
under the sun above the waves
under three crowns when im far away
maybe what i miss most

hook
and maybe youll never know
and maybe youll never know
maybe youll never know

verse 2
life beyond the window
im jealous of the way that black bird flies
free among the people
those quarter million stories pass me by
see calum scott liveget tickets as low as 62you might also likeprechorus
woah lie awake in the moonlight i ooh
its the last on my mind

chorus
and maybe what i miss most
it wasnt made of steel and stone
and maybe what i miss most
it wasnt born of skin and bone
under the sun above the waves
under three crowns when im far away
maybe what i miss most

hook
and maybe youll never know
and maybe youll never know
and maybe youll never know

bridge
i remember at the table
all those faces where did they go
i imagine what it looks like
when im not there
i remember every summer
but now the years are just a number
theres no backwards
time is faster with everything ive left behind oh
chorus
but maybe what i miss most
it wasnt made of steel and stone
and maybe what i miss most
it wasnt born of skin and bone
cause under the sun above the waves
under three crowns when im far away
maybe what i miss most

hook
and maybe youll never know
and maybe youll never know
and maybe youll never know2embed"
