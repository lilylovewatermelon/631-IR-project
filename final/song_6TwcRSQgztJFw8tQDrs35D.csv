i regret that i told the world
that you were with me
and i regret how i showed the world
that you were pretty
i never thought id learn so much
so much from bein lonely
but i guess i didnt learn enough
cause now you wont hold me

chorus
i guess i got lost in the moment
i guess i got lost in the fall
i guess i got lost in your heartbeat
in the thrill of it all
and i guess you were goddamn perfect
cause every single time you call
i remind myself of what i lost that night my love
in the thrill of it all
in the thrill of it all

verse 2
even though we werent in love
it was far from lust
mmm yeah you were beautiful
but in you i could trust
others they warned my heart
they said i would lose fast
they said that you were stoppin ground
and soon to be my past

i guess i got lost in the moment
i guess i got lost in the fall
i guess i got lost in your heartbeat
in the thrill of it all
and i guess you were goddamn perfect
cause every single time you call
i remind myself of what i lost that night my love
in the thrill of it all oh
in the thrill of it all

outro
and i guess you were goddamn perfect
cause every single time you call
i remind myself of what i lost that night my love
i remind myself of what i lost that night my love
i remind myself of what i lost that night my love
