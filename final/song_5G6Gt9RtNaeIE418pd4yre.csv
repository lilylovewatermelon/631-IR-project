you know
ive always been collected calm and chill
and you know
i never look for conflict for the thrill
but if i’m feeling
someone stepping towards you cant describe
just what im feeling

for you i’d go
step to a dude much bigger than me
for you i know
i would get messed up weigh 153
for you
i would get beat to smithereens

verse 2
you know
ill be in the corner taking notes
and you know
