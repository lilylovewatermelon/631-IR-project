i heard them calling in the distance
so i packed my things and ran
far away from all the trouble
i have caused with my two hands

prechorus ragnar
alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow
we fled far away

chorus nanna bryndís hilmarsdóttir ragnar
hold your horses now
we sleep until the sun goes down
through the woods we ran
deep into the mountain sound
hold your horses now
we sleep until the sun goes down
through the woods we ran

verse 2 ragnar
some had scars and some had scratches
it made me wonder about their past
and as i looked around i began to notice
that we were nothing like the rest

chorus nanna ragnar
hold your horses now
we sleep until the sun goes down
through the woods we ran
deep into the mountain sound
hold your horses now
we sleep until the sun goes down
through the woods we ran
