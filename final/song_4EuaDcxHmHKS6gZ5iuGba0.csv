i tiptoed in the room
i know you got to have your rest
she says come lay beside me
i been waitin since you left

chorus
shes sweet to me
must be the luckiest man alive
did i tell you baby
you are the joy of my life

verse 2
the first time that i saw you
mmm you took my breath away
i might not get to heaven
but i walked with the angels that day

chorus
she takes me by the hand
i am the luckiest man alive
did i tell you baby
you are the joy of my life

verse 3
some may have their riches
some may have their worldly things
as long as i have you
ill treasure each and every day
