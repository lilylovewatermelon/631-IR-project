how do i breathe
how do i breathe

verse 1
it feels so different being here
i was so used to being next to you
life for me is not the same
theres no one to turn to
i dont know why i let it go too far
starting over  its so hard
seems like everywhere i try to go
i keep thinking of you

prechorus
i just had a wake up call
wishing that i never let you fall
baby you are not to blame at all
when im the one that pushed you away
baby if you knew i cared
youd have never went nowhere nowhere
girl i shouldve been right there

chorus
how do i breathe
without you here by my side
how will i see
when your love brought me to the light
where do i go
when your hearts where i lay my head
when youre not with me
how do i breathe
how do i breathe

prechorus
