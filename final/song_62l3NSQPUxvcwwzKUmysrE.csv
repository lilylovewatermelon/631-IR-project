lil capalot bitch ha

verse 1
smooth criminal mike jack
and i still like to tote a 45 like mike back
pull that tec out just to make a statement
he gon need a body bag or a night sack
he a bitch hell fold under pressure
i can tell from his posture man he aint really like that
mama told me i dont care if you scared
go in for the kill if they try you better fight back
well beat his ass if he try to throw the folks up
whats all that shit you was sayin like you was so tough
they gon have to carry your mans if he approach us
creepin in that glizzyll blam when we get close up
richass gangster my gun match the color of my car
any sudden movemеnt and this bitch go fah fah
bet i have him huggin allah
im the goat im a thug im a star

chorus
youngin tryna clеar a crowd with the heat
when you ridin better keep a 40 cal by the seat
he was bangin wrong til they found him deceased
its a whole lot of evil roamin round in the streets uh
so you better look both ways make your soul shake
demons standin in the doorway
tell me annie are you okay screamin out no way
tell me annie are you okay

still on that bullshit mj
really one of the hottest and i never dropped a mixtape
all my life had to risktake
but if they come and try me 40 kickin til my wrist break
let anybody in this bitch play
ima have my cs leave his ass in the ground with a stiff face
where im from all the killers turn hood legend
and they known through them blocks like dikembe
totin on something bigger than the great khali
thirty shotsll knock him down like muhammad ali
do the race scratch off in a trackhawk jeep
catch him lackin then its rip bitch

chorus
youngin tryna clear a crowd with the heat
when you ridin better keep a 40 cal by the seat
he was bangin wrong til they found him deceased
its a whole lot of evil roamin round in the streets uh
so you better look both ways make your soul shake
demons standin in the doorway
tell me annie are you okay screamin out no way
tell me annie are you okay33embed"
