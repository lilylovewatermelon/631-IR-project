in the face of adversity i prepared a verse to see
or hear rather

verse 1
destined to win get respect where i live
my reflection contagious i’m the messenger here
making love to the streets they be lusting for bread
they ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed
when the city was chocolate there was death in the air
all i’m hearing is aids i ain’t deaf in my ear
nah … i ain’t deaf in my ear
but he push them whites in the hood like ray edmond was there
shout out to kirbo he told me i would make it
now me tony g and tre got the keys to the nation
pray for peace with the babies they a beast in the summer
of course he fiending for trouble he had a fiend for a mother
got no leaders among him got no loyalty either
once the police get to cuffing bet his homie deceive him
see it’s cold where they be at on that boat like a pirate
politicians fucking hookers why you mad at my ganja
kick him out of the city force them whites who can pay up
still different ablers killing over what isn’t theirs
lost my nigga over nothing though
saeed alisha i miss you god bless my brother’s soul
you might also likechorus sam dew
i feel something change in the weather and i’m home home home
don’t let it drift away like a feather and i’m home home home
and oh i gotta find my way
oh i gotta face the day
but oh i can’t stay away not never your my home home home

verse 2
look i lost my nigga over nothing though
saeed alisha i miss you god bless my brother’s soul
ricky is sitting baba was sitting
caught up and slipping for fearing a mcdonald’s position
seen it over a dollar got him under a flower
funeral drama niggas mystery baby mamas
they ain’t really for condoms i just think that it’s shocking
got no fear in no officer they be scared of them doctors
i’m aware that there’s problems no obama gon’ stop it
where there’s minimal conscience and there’s thousands of choppers
i know howard that college but uptown has some problems
i done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise
little women be mommas little niggas ain’t fathers
ain’t nobody here leading it’s way too easy to follow
they knee deep in today ain’t too fond of tomorrow
although weight gets you paper i pray youre weighing your options
this is soulful my nigga i’m hoping i am giving a hope to my nigga
we just soldiers my nigga — don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga
this is soulful my nigga hope that i am giving some hope to my nigga
we just soldiers my nigga — don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga
nigga know you my
and you know my nigga
know you my
look
chorus sam dew
i feel something change in the weather and i’m home home home
don’t let it drift away like a feather and i’m home home home
and oh i gotta find my way
oh i gotta face the day
but oh i can’t stay away not never your my home home home

verse 3
a kings assassination is why most often fear the hell
so needless to say this leadership is not with a timid sail
i pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and
i pray whenever i’m seen in my city i forever resemble braille
may your trees be loud and your queens be proud
may you see your dreams allowed before you see them from a cloud
may your glass never reach halfempty may your enemies find the innerpeace before it ever get to beef
i wish you wealth health and pactfree women for yourself and the shit ain’t the best hope these lyrics helpmy nigga

chorus sam dew
i feel something change in the weather and i’m home home home
don’t let it drift away like a feather and i’m home home home
and oh i gotta find my way
oh i gotta face the day
but oh i can’t stay away not never your my home home home

outro tone p
see i made it from home see i made it alone
and all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne
time after time again and again
they wanna see a nigga lose but i’m destined to win8embed"
