verse lil tracy
baby im a asshole walkin through my castle
i can break your heart baby i know its so fragile
step inside my castle we blowin on that good dope
put this in your nostril baby i got good blow
fuck her then i vanish disappear like magic
i live lavish gucci sheets all on my mattress
gothboiclique skrrtskrrt in a black whip
pullin down her skirt i know you want it you can have it
welcome to my castle its just me and you tonight
i think youre an angel just a human in disguise
this is not rap its a goth lullaby
ill be in your dreams every time that we get high
lie lie lie all you ever do is lie
look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
grew up in the mud in a castle ima die
