i ran it up without looking back
soon ill be up in a palace like alice and waving to y’all through the looking glass
hold up wait that’s a just mirror
they know my flow is superior
im bout my dough like a deer
whip is german engineered
im laughing at you in the rear here
we go i go you know i know i go stupid i go psycho
last longer than a switch to geico
dick too good make you hit a high note
pingpong from my laptop to my iphone
tiktok blowing up mustve went viral again
liable to win im my biggest enemy kylo ren
i say boy bye just like brockhampton
bye bye bye we not nsync
you say you the hardest and smartest of artists
but sit and get high so we cant link
its a shameful sight
when your wasting your lifе
like you poured it in a bowl and therе’s no milk
and my name is adam but they call me bob when they see all the wonderful things that i’ve built haha
not street but that don’t mean i act soft
he talk down i hit em with a hacksaw
my hooks hard gon leave you with a cracked jaw
they gone come back for some more just like crack rock
move quiet like i hit the jackpot
say you my friend oh that’s funny ill laugh now
i caught you wearing a mask call u mascot
nobody likes to get burnt like a hashbrown
you fucked up big like waco
better back off from your boy like dej loaf
he brewing to fight its a ko
jiujitsu get spun like a dreidel
boutta age like im john stamos
you boutta age like old ass mayo
im finna put the cat in the cradle
im top dawg dont need em to say so
i aint too religious but ill go to hell fore i check out your soundcloud
and that’s not fictitious im not with the faking my name is not bow wow
well that was malicious im sorry for kicking your teeth with a roundhouse
and im sorry to say it but yo shit trash so u could get hit with this groundpound bitchyou might also likeembed"
