you say he dont treat you right
you say it aint the same
he spends all his time playing your heart
like its just a game
he should have never let you go
now i got a real good reason
to let you know
i wanna hold you close
and pick up the pieces

chorus
you dont have to be alone tonight
why you sitting at home tonight
waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
to tell you that he wants you
lets get out of town tonight
get lost and found tonight
till you dont care
let me love you right
lets go somewhere where you and i
can be all alone tonight

verse 2
i wanna see your face
and whisper in your ear
im gonna say all the little things
youve been wanting to hear

you dont have to be alone tonight
why you sitting at home tonight
waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
to tell you that he wants you

lets go somewhere where you and i
can be all alone tonight
be all alone tonight

you dont have to be alone tonight
i want you for my own tonight

chorus
girl you dont have to be alone tonight
why you sitting at home tonight
waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
to tell you that he wants you
lets get out of town tonight
get lost and found tonight
till you dont care
let me love you right
lets go somewhere where you and i
can be all alone tonight
