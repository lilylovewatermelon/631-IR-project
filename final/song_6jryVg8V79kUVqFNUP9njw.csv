nailed inside my head
fuck this i dont need your shit
all the lies deceit and arrogance
talk your shit like my life is some kinda game
like you fuckin know me
just go far away and be small
run far away and be small
go lie in a hole and be small

verse 1
thorns so you want inside of me
splinters so you want a piece of this
pushing so you want to tear me down
under my skin for your own selfish wants and needs
so you want inside of me they want in
so you want a piece of this sharpened tongue
so you want to tear me down to penetrate me
for your own selfish wants and needs

chorus
if you really think
you got what it takes to be me to penetrate me
then walk a mile in the skin
of my head case mental being to penetrate me
so you want a piece
of this life that belongs to me to penetrate me
well make a cut on the line
and take a deeper look inside of the freak to penetrate me

that is me
fucker come on

verse 2
disturb so you want inside of me
searching so you want a piece of this
prying so you want to tear me down
upon my scales for your own selfish wants and needs
so you want inside of me to get in
so you want a piece of this lance the core
so you want to tear me down to penetrate me
for your own selfish wants and needs

chorus
if you really think
you got what it takes to be me
then walk a mile in the skin
of my head case mental being
so you want a piece
of this life that belongs to me
well make a cut on the line
and take a deeper look inside of the freak

just to get in my face

without the s on my chest
trying to step in my circle im leaving you purple and black
on your back drop your ass like a heart attack
rippin through your life like a motherfuckin hurricane
fist full of novocain for the pain
youre nothing
in my life
in my head
youre nothing
in my life
in my head

nailed inside my head
youre under my fuckin skin

i have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
and threaten place always in my face
i think its time for them to
go away always in my fuckin space
always in my scene always in my sight
always in my way youre
dead to me
punk ass fuck
