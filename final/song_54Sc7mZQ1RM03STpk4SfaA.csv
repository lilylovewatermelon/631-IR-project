i have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
we were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
laughin at my sister as shes dazzling the room
then you walked in and my heart went “boom”
tryin to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
everybodys dancin and the bands top volume

grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

eliza  all women

my sister made her way across the room to you ooh
and i got nervous thinking “whats she gonna do” ooh

an acre of land a troop to command a dollop of fame
all i haves my honor a tolerance for pain
a couple of college credits and my topnotch brain
insane your family brings out a different side of me
peggy confides in me angelica tried to take a bite of me
no stress my love for you is never in doubt
well get a little place in harlem and well figure it out
ive been livin without a family since i was a child
my father left my mother died i grew up buckwild
but ill never forget my mothers face that was real
and long as im alive eliza swear to god
