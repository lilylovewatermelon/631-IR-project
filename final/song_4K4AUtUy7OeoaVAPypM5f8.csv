baby i dont understand
with just a touch of your hand
can make me feel invincible
do you know just where you take me
do you know how high you make me
i need your kiss like oxygen
with your arms warm around me
when your eyes look deep into me
its unstoppable
baby anything is possible

chorus
everything i wanna be
any dream i wanna dream i can
because of your love
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love

verse 2
dont know how i lived before you
now i live to explore you
take me girl to your secret world
where i could swim in your deep blue passion
or i could feel your love come crashing over me endlessly
whether youre right by my side or
whether you and i are a million miles apart
i can always feel you in my heart
