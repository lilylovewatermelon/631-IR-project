kisses dont no they dont never dont lie
you can run if you want but you cant hide
tellin you its the truth dont you ask why
kisses dont no they dont kisses dont lie

verse 1
emotions come and go
who knows how the wind will blow
theres so little in this world to trust in
seduce themselves with lies
some dont realize
they call it love but its really only lustin yeah

prechorus
so you see you and me
were gettin close to the danger zone
show me how tell me now
should i stay or should i go
cause im caught between yes and no

chorus
cause when you kiss me
i feel everything that ive been missin
i try to slow down but my heart wont listen
and its tearin me all up inside
and when you touch me
i feel a rush but im afraid that it might crush me
should i put my trust in somethin i dont trust in
i try to run but theres no place to hide
cause baby kisses dont lie
