3 straights l exclaiming excuses ahh choo

verse 1
a fakeass minime in the ring with me so rest in peace but best believe stop playing you a toy tryna threaten me
burned lil bitch giving you a 3rd degree
god thinks he high as fuck yeah that bitch on ecstasy
no hiv but this bitch gon die like eazy e
all my bars cold fuelling fire yeah no vaseline
never tried to be intricate i rhyme better than you infinite
loki and his little cronies named a critically acclaimed flaming pile of shit after sonic ocs
oneonone cunt lets see if i dont fuck you up
yes put your bets please so i can finally beat the shit outta this fucking chump
3 sixes sleeping deep 3 remixes
yous suiting up hard bitch but you never mean business
rapping bout the present this a meanass christmas
santa gave me a hitlist not a fucking wishlist
you might also likeverse 2
b rabbit stop choking on mommas spaghetti
so you go lower than lil jon thats pretty petty
call me mgk but geazys real sleazy killin’ beats
i don’t beat em c breezy without glasses you cant see me
lookin like you seen a ghost tryna make your shit a coax
my throw away lines are better than your best roasts
wannabe 2pac your deadass sitting on the west coast
let me guess you’ve already used your best joke
subject when you beg for guest appearances
you dont have my respect and ill never take you serious
how the fuck can you call yourself a lyricist
vegeta get used to number two
guess ill call you stan too
an apology from you is definitely overdue

bridge
named a whole song after a gimmick chess
that’s the furthest i heard from an actual diss
saying checkmate never called myself a king
but you seem to think youre above everything

verse 3
die like the rest with the black death
teeth looking nasty austin powers with that bad breath
this kid likes talking shit on insta
he never killed nobody hes no fucken hitler
think you caused a genocide
i was laughing when you was rapping over homicide
kais italy my guy switching sidetoside
my career was well on its way before you arrived cuz this aint 1985
in time lil pumps gon stop thinking he can rhyme
bridge
gonna diss me for using rhymezone eh
atleast i used those words for something that i wrote eh

verse 4
im surprised that this guy hasnt died though i left him bleeding
youre on about dumb shit like my ribs unlike ad libs i aint even screaming
ryus hadoken doesnt do shit against motherfucking akumas raging demon
you and tory lanez got something in common
you both think youre hot and you both think youre poppin
4am flex stole the art of peer pressure
tory steals shit why you feel you need leverage

verse 5
this bitch thought i wouldnt find it and when i did he denied it pinocchios nose grows like a beanstalk and awoke the sleeping giant you like fairy tales cuz every time mason lies yeah
it really fucking fails
you couldnt stick the nail in tell another tale prick
trying to defame me labelling me jayz yeah imma rocafella
during acapella i was ksi yeah and your ass was joe weller
you stood there still with a guard to your head
this a oneshot kill and im leaving you dead
taking shots at my dad bitch i guess thats cool
atleast mine didnt make an ugly ass wombat like you

verse 6
im dwayne “the rock” johnson thats a fucking compliment
you should stick to shitty memes and ill continue making rhyme schemes cuz all your shit is ass like fucken heinzbeans
this aint it fam
call me out for slut shaming you fucking hypocrite
you talked about someones stepdad raping her and shit
that shows youre not a man
i knew that sorry suits two dumb bitches from japan
call me mobb deep cuz i left this bitch really burned
hes a shook one
cuz it only took one
verse to realise youve been cooked son
bridge
ay spell out mgk well imma spell out motherfucking killshot

verse 7
killed careers dead for the rest of your fucken days
illegal the way i had to put you in the fucken grave
literally bottomline fucken lil tay
lame is the word left for your fucken family name
shame created a spark and lit the fucken flame
hang you might get a pic with the fucking logang
olé youve proved youre not worth my fucking
time

outro
