verse
tell me how you believe in something that youve never seen
is true love real or is it make believe
gave you my heart with a set of keys
told me youll never leave now you want me to set you free yeah
took a while to begin now i know where to start yeah
really my best friend always had my heart
everything feel so wrong whenever we get apart
every time we together alone we see shooting stars
member when we first found love on the road
my number one fan there for all of my shows
in the studio with me all night along watchin me achieve my goals
fuck all these hoes and fuck all this money
miss the old days back when we was youngins
way before this drivin on the cold decembers
it was me and you against the world i remember
was only nineteen when we moved to atlanta
way before the fortune the fame and the glamour
couldnt get it right no i stayed in my feelings
cause you made mistakes but i made a million
often forgettin that we was still young
through the fussin and the fightin it was still love
never seen nothin like it it was real love it was real love
but now
you might also likechorus
all alone on my darkest nights
tryna make it through my hardest times
wherever you are tonight
i hope you know youll have my heart for life
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever forever and ever
all alone on my darkest nights
tryna make it through my hardest times
wherever you are tonight
i hope you know youll have my heart for life
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever forever and ever

outro
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever and ever
forever and ever forever and everembed"
