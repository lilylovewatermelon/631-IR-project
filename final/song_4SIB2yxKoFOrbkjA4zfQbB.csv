this beat from murda

chorus
girl you got me losin my mind
i just want you to see that im trying
ever since you left the sun dont shine
dont want to lose you in this race against time
hypnotized by your love im blind
its so hard to pay attention to the signs
without you feel like slowly im dying
broken hearts can make a grown man cry

verse 1
i was sittin there just thinkin then reality it hit me
hope i feel your same pain when that bitch karma come and get me
feel like i dont deserve you no more but i want you to be with me
we done built a bond so strong and from that love i know you miss me
connected to your soul i feel it when you hug and kiss me
now your shoulder is so cold and lately i been feelin empty
i got caught up in this fame and all these hoes i let it tempt me
in that hotel room alone remember i would hold you gently
went on dates we took some pictures everything was movin quickly
manipulated i aint think a new relationship would fit me
but i told you we can try it even though i know its risky
mind games with our emotions swear this shit get kinda tricky

its so hard to pay attention to the signs

verse 2
keep her in love pink cause i like how them joggers fit her
wonderin how ima play it it was hard to get her
so beautiful i keep her smilin when i compliment her
if bein this bad is a sin i hope that god forgive her
just had a son im tryna be the perfect father figure
i kept you worried in them trenches tryna dodge the killers
tryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger
its hard to love with dysfunction wish my scars was thinner
tryna forgive me in your thoughts i hope your heart remember
know its gon hurt to see another nigga bondin with her
cant even look you in your eyes cause im burnin up with guilt
for that one moment went too far and now i fucked up what we built

chorus
girl you got me losin my mind
i just want you to see that im trying
ever since you left the sun dont shine
dont want to lose you in this race against time
hypnotized by your love im blind
its so hard to pay attention to the signs
without you feel like slowly im dying
broken hearts can make a grown man cry30embed"
