with good understanding
and a lot of patience
you can make it yes you can
beyond your wildest dreams

verse 1
here we are in the prime of life
were so ripe
yeah the times right
here we go and were high of expectations
lets not waste them

hook
oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
i can tell that you deserve the best in life
if i offer you the chance to live tonight
then take it
we can make it

bridge
dont wait til tomorrow
dont wait til tomorrow lets go
dont wait til tomorrow
we waited all our lives
dont waste another day

hook
oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice

if i offer you the chance to live tonight
then take it
we can make it
