they breed defeat
we all repeat the same old song
and youre too far gone
the truth is known
refuse to sell the lies youre numb enough to tell
i dont care if youll stay
its not my scene if its only back stabing
rolling in is obscene
no one wanted your lies fronted in a curtin of gold
i wont sympathize your lack of wise words are the symptoms of our fall
the kids dont care
they are not even there
whoever told you life was fair
they refuse to buy
your song is just a lullaby
its time to say goodbye
i wont fall again i wont let you tell take me with
you into this grey and blue area its hard to find one anyway
i dont care if youll stayyou might also likeembed"
