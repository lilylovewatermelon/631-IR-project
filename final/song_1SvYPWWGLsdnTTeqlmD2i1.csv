uh looks like i wrote this song on paper
first time i did that in like three years
my handwriting is— is horrible and i can barely read this
hmm

verse 1
hey hey dont even know whats in my head anymore though
uh figured out i aint gonna go to college lee corso
fuckin girls but i never kept the door closed
want you all to hear the way i put it in her torso
i aint normal im clinically insane
i guess its the result of all the drugs that enterin my brain
all of a sudden every legend keep on mentionin my name
all that does is show me that my life will never be the same
police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
i tell those cops suck dog nuts haha
arrivin to the party in a chariot
lookin for a scary bitch that i can pop her cherry pit
im very sick yes very ill
eternal sunshine jim carrey feel
at the amusement park scared of heights ferris wheel
double dare me to kill

chorus
got some soul like de la do
they say im new its nothin but some déjà vu
everywhere you go these people hate on you
its déjà vu déjà vu one time for the grind
a little soul like de la do
they say im new nothin but some déjà vu
everywhere i go these people hate on you
déjà vu déjà vu

wind chimes sick rhymes
been high on this incline
tryna get my money stackin tall 69
have some caviar sip wine
sacrificin sanity sacrificin normal
purpose is for people in the plural
form never formal an art form not a mural
work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
see a girl thats lookin horny in the fourth row
ha i just put it in her mouth ortho
dontist manipulatin phonics put em into sonnets
let me put you on this nastier than nas is
bubonic plague bacteria thats tryna find a way
spread like yolk of a broken egg
talkin shit you just diggin your grave

chorus
got some soul like de la do
they say im new its nothin but some déjà vu
everywhere you go these people hate on you
its déjà vu déjà vu
a little soul like de la do
they say im new nothin but some déjà vu
everywhere i go these people hate on you
déjà vu déjà vu
verse 3
hypothetically of dope i kick incredibly
potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
no methamphetamines hot a hundredten degrees
visually stunnin gotta see it on the led
when i was seventeen i thought i had it figured out
now i see what its about went in down a different route
its crucial three new schools life with a spoonful
of sugar yeah i need my medicine
fuckin mary poppins gotta treat her like the president
represent all these fuckin people that i never met
some expect me to be the greatest ever
hear me on the radio shitll change forever
now im just a pop sensation fuck your expectations
ima be the best have some patience
you thought that it was great then poof
it was nothin but some déjà vu

outro
