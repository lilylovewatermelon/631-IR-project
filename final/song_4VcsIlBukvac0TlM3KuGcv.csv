if only tonight we could sleep
in a bed made of flowers
if only tonight we could fall
in a deathless spell
if only tonight we could slide
into deep black water
and breathe
and breathe
then an angel would come
with burning eyes like stars
and bury us deep
in his velvet arms
and the rain would cry
as our faces slipped away
and the rain would cry
