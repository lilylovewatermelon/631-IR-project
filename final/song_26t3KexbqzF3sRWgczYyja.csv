you were raised on an asphalt farm
aint never heard a rooster crow
never walked barefoot by a river
felt the mud up betweenst your toes
you never rolled in the hay
you never thrown it in four wheel
climb up on in here girl
let me show you how country feels

chorus
let your hair down hair down get you some of this laid on back
kick your shoes off kick em off get you some of this slow down fast
ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
let me show you how country feels

verse 2
never watched the sun go down
from the bed of a pickup truck
you ever been so into somebody
youre still lying there when it comes back up
girl what do you say what do you say
well cut a path through that cornfield
park down by the water
let me show you how country feels

let your hair down hair down get you some of this laid on back
kick your shoes off kick em off get you some of this slow down fast
ill take you up and down these hollers and hills
let me show you how country feels
