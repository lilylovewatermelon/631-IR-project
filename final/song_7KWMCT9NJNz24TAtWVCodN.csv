7KWMCT9NJNz24TAtWVCodN,The Animals on the Farm (Sing-Along) - Instrumental,Super Simple Songs,2T9jkpdjKDjzoOqPfaCAMu,"3 contributorsthe poetaster act 5 scene 1 lyricsbanquet halls are a very special place where under one big roof so many different memories are made from proms to weddings to baby showers once that dj starts to spin theres something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with singalong dance tunes top 40 hits come and go and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time not only do they never go out of style they are essential components of the perfect hoedown in all banquet halls

1 the chicken dance
this song is a great opener to get the crowd going even the stiffest old timers cant help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on and what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks this is a great song for a countrythemed wedding

2 macarena by los dos rios
a major craze when first released in 1995 the macarena will keep the energy up up up the simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination and the latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat

3 dancing queen by abba
lighthearted and bubbly dancing queen is a musthave for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young dancing queen was written for the royal swedish wedding in 1976 but its candysweet ebullience is as fresh as ever this song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the us

4 my heart will go on by celine dion
the words are simple the feeling is big lost love is in the air and nobody ever said it better than celine play this song later in the night after a few glasses of wine have everyone mistyeyed and ready to belt out my heart will go on and ooooooon with celine

5 dont stop believin by journey
the ultimate crowdpleaser bring the mood up again with journeys quintessential americana midnight adventure song fists will pump and memories of latenight train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back even though this song came out in 1981 it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who werent even born then know the words its a great goodbye goodnight and see you on the road song

these timehonored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because theyve got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh they are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones

riage first gave sign
unto his contract fire and air did shine
as guilty of the match and from the hill
the nymphs with shriekings do the region fill
here first began their bane this day was ground
of all their ills for now nor rumours sound
nor nice respect of state moves dido ought
her love no longer now by stealth is sought
she calls this wedlock and with that fair name
covers her fault forthwith the bruit and fame
through all the greatest lybian towns is gone
fame a fleet evil than which is swifter none
that moving grows and flying gathers strength
little at first and fearful but at length
she dares attempt the skies and stalking proud
with feet on ground her head doth pierce a cloud
this child our parent earth stirrd up with spite
of all the gods brought forth and as some write
she was last sister of that giant race
that thought to scale jove s court right swift of pace
and swifter far of wing a monster vast
and dreadful look how many plumes are placed
on her huge corps so many waking eyes
stick underneath and which may stranger rise
in the report as many tongues she bears
as many mouths as many listening ears
nightly in midst of all the heaven she flies
and through the earths dark shadow shrieking cries
nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep
by day on tops of houses she doth keep
or on high towers and doth thence affright
cities and towns of most conspicuous site
as covetous she is of tales and lies
as prodigal of truth this monster—

these hungry courthounds scent it out

caes

lup

caes
then tis no libel

hor
it is the imperfect body of an emblem caesar i began for
mecaenas

lup
an emblem right thats greek for a libel do but mark how
confident he is

hor
a just man cannot fear thou foolish tribune
not though the malice of traducing tongues
the open vastness of a tyrants ear
the senseless rigour of the wrested laws
or the red eyes of straind authority
should in a point meet all to take his life
his innocence is armour gainst all these

lup
innocence o impudence let me see let me see is not here an
eagle and is not that eagle meant by caesar ha does not caesar
give the eagle answer me what sayest thou

tuc

hor
pish ha ha

lup
dost thou pish me give me my long sword

hor
with reverence to great caesar worthy romans
observe but this ridiculous commenter
the soul to my device was in this distich
thus oft the base and ravenous multitude
survive to share the spoils of fortitude
which in this body i have figured here
a vulture—

lup
a vulture ay now tis a vulture o abominable monstrous
monstrous has not your vulture a beak has it not legs and
talons and wings and feathers

tuc
touch him old buskins

hor
and therefore must it be an eagle

mec
respect him not good horace say your device

hor
a vulture and a wolf

lup
a wolf good thats i i am the wolf my names lupus i am
meant by the wolf on on a vulture and a wolf

hor
preying upon the carcass of an ass—

lup
an ass good still thats i too i am the ass you mean me by
the ass

mec

hor
if you will needs take it i cannot with modesty give it from

mec

were wont to figure in their hieroglyphics
patience frugality and fortitude
for none of which we can suspect you tribune

caes
who was it lupus that informd you first this should be
meant by us or wast your comment

lup

caes
let him be whipped lictors go take him hence
and lupus for your fierce credulity
one fit him with a pair of larger ears
tis caesars doom and must not be revoked
we hate to have our court and peace disturbd
with these quotidian clamours see it done

lup
caesar 

exeunt some of the lictors with lupus and aesop
caes
gag him that we may have his silence

virg
caesar hath done like caesar fair and just
is his award against these brainless creatures
tis not the wholesome sharp morality
or modest anger of a satiric spirit
that hurts or wounds the body of the state
but the sinister application
of the malicious ignorant and base
interpreter who will distort and strain
the general scope and purpose of an author
to his particular and private spleen

caes
we know it our dear virgil and esteem it
a most dishonest practice in that man
will seem too witty in anothers work
what would cornelius gallus and tibullus

they whisper caesar
tuc
to mecaenas nay but as thou art a man dost hear a man
of worship and honourable hold here take thy chain again
resume mad mecoenas what dost thou think i meant to have kept it old boy no i did it but to fright thee i to try how thou
wouldst take it what will i turn shark upon my friends or my
friends friends i scorn it with my three souls come i love

demetrius fannius playdresser and plagiary that you not having
the fear of phoebus or his shafts before your eyes contrary to
the peace of our liege lord augustus caesar his crown and
dignity and against the form of a statute in that case made and
provided have moat ignorantly foolishly and more like
yourselves maliciously gone about to deprave and calumniate the
person and writings of quintus horatius flaccus here present
poet and priest to the muses and to that end have mutually
conspired and plotted at sundry times as by several means and in
sundry places for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose taxing him falsely of selflove arrogancy impudence
railing filching by translation etc of all which calumnies and
every of them in manner and form aforesaid what answer you are you guilty or not guilty

of my deserving i wusse but since it hath pleased the court to
make choice of my wisdom and gravity come my calumnious
varlets lets hear you talk for yourselves now an hour or two
what can you say make a noise act act

virg
stay turn and take an oath first you shall swear
by thunderdarting jove the king of gods
and by the genius of augustus caesar
by your own white and uncorrupted souls
and the deep reverence of our roman justice
to judge this case with truth and equity
as bound by your religion and your laws
now read the evidence but first demand
of either prisoner if that writ be theirs
gives him two papers
tib
shew this unto crispinus is it yours

tuc

tuc

but boldly nominate a spade a spade
what shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse
live as she were defunct like punk in stews

tuc
excellent

alas that were no modern consequence
to have cothurnal buskins frighted hence
no teach thy incubus to poetise
and throw abroad thy spurious snotteries
upon that puftup lump of balmy froth

tuc
ah ah

or clumsy chilblaind judgment that with oath
magnificates his merit and beapawls
the conscious time with humorous foam and brawls
as if his organons of sense would crack
the sinews of my patience break his back
o poets all and some for now we list
of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist
crispinus

tuc
ay marry this was written like a hercules in poetry now

caes
excellently well threatend

virg
and as strangely worded caesar

caes
we observe it

virg
the other now

tuc
this is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too this will do
well

tib
our muse is in mind for th untrussing a poet
i slip by his name for most men do know it
a critic that all the world bescumbers
with satirical humours and lyrical numbers

tuc
art thou there boy

and for the most part himself doth advance
with much selflove and more arrogance

tuc
good again

and but that i would not be thought a prater
i could tell you he were a translator
i know the authors from whence he has stole
and could trace him too but that
i understand them not full and whole

tuc
that line is broke loose from all his fellows chain him up
shorter do

the best note i can give you to know him by
is that he keeps gallants company
whom i could wish in time should him fear
lest after they buy repentance too dear
deme fannius

tuc
well said this carries palm with it

hor
and why thou motley gull why should they fear
when hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend
i dare thy malice to betray it speak
now thou curlst up thou poor and nasty snake
and shrinkst thy poisonous head into thy bosom
out viper thou that eatst thy parents hence
rather such speckled creatures as thyself
should be eschewd and shunnd such as will bite
and gnaw their absent friends not cure their fame
catch at the loosest laughters and affect
to be thought jesters such as can devise
things never seen or head timpair mens names
and gratify their credulous adversaries
will carry tales do basest offices
cherish divided fires and still encrease
new flames out of old embers will reveal
each secret thats committed to their trust
these be black slaves romans take heed of these

tuc
thou twangst right little horace they be indeed a couple of
chapfalln curs come we of the bench lets rise to the urn and
condemn them quickly

virg
before you go together worthy romans
we are to tender our opinion
and give you those instructions that may add
unto your even judgment in the cause
which thus we do commence first you must know
that where there is a true and perfect merit
there can be no dejection and the scorn
of humble baseness oftentimes so works
in a high soul upon the grosser spirit
that to his bleared and offended sense
there seems a hideous fault blazed in the object
when only the disease is in his eyes
herehence it comes our horace now stands taxd
of impudence selflove and arrogance
by those who share no merit in themselves
and therefore think his portion is as small
for they from their own guilt assure their souls
if they should confidently praise their works
in them it would appear inflation
which in a full and well digested man
cannot receive that foul abusive name
but the fair title of erection
and for his true use of translating men
it still hath been a work of as much palm
in clearest judgments as to invent or make
his sharpness—that is most excusable
as being forced out of a suffering virtue
oppressed with the license of the time—
and howsoever fools or jerking pedants
players or suchlike buffoon barking wits
may with their beggarly and barren trash
tickle base vulgar ears in their despite
this like joves thunder shall their pride control
the honest satire hath the happiest soul

now romans you have heard our thoughts
withdraw when you please

tib
remove the accused from the bar

tuc
who holds the urn to us ha fear nothing ill quit you mine
honest pitiful stinkards ill dot

cris
captain you shall eternally girt me to you as i am
generous

tuc
go to

caes
tibullus let there be a case of vizards privately provided
we have found a subject to bestow them on

tib
it shall be done caesar

caes
here be words horace able to bastinado a mans ears

hor ay
please it great caesar i have pills about me
mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore
would give him a light vomit that should purge
his brain and stomach of those tumorous heats
might i have leave to minister unto him

caes
o be his aesculapius gentle horace
you shall have leave and he shall be your patient virgil
use your authority command him forth

virg
caesar is careful of your health crispinus
and hath himself chose a physician
to minister unto you take his pills

hor
they are somewhat bitter sir but very wholesome
take yet another so stand by theyll work anon

tib
romans return to your several seats lictors bring forward
the urn and set the accused to the bar

tuc
quickly you whoreson egregious varlets come forward what
shall we sit all day upon you you make no more haste now than a
beggar upon pattens or a physician to a patient that has no money
you pilchers

tib
rufus laberius crispinus and demetrius fannius hold up your
hands you have according to the roman custom put yourselves upon trial to the urn for divers and sundry calumnies whereof you
have before this time been indicted and are now presently
arraigned prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your
tryers caius cilnius mecaenas pronounceth you by this
handwriting guilty cornelius gallus guilty pantilius tucca—

tuc
parcelguilty i

dem
he means himself for it was he indeed
subornd us to the calumny

tuc
i you whoreson cantharides was it i

dem
i appeal to your conscience captain

tib

dem

tib
what saith crispinus

cris
o the captain the captain—

bor

do me right royal caesar

caes
marry and i will sir—lictors gag him do
and put a case of vizards oer his head
that he may look bifronted as he speaks

tuc
gods and fiends caesar thou wilt not caesar wilt thou
away you whoreson vultures away you think i am a dead corps now because caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark or so hold  your hookd talons out of my flesh you inhuman harpies go to dot what will the royal augustus cast away a gentleman of
worship a captain and a commander for a couple of condemnd
caitiff calumnious cargos

caes
dispatch lictors

tuc caesar
the vizards are put upon him
caes
forward tibullus

virg
demand what cause they had to malign horace

dem
in troth no great cause not i i must confess but that he
kept better company for the most part than i and that better men
loved him than loved me and that his writings thrived better than
mine and were better liked and graced nothing else

virg
thus envious souls repine at others good

hor
if this be all faith i forgive thee freely
envy me still so long as virgil loves me
gallus tibullus and the bestbest caesar
my dear mecaenas while these with many more
whose names i wisely slip shall think me worthy
their honourd and adored society

hor
how do you feel yourself

cris
pretty and well i thank you

virg
these pills can but restore him for a time
not cure him quite of such a malady
caught by so many surfeits which have filld
his blood and brain thus full of crudities
tis necessary therefore he observe
a strict and wholesome diet look you take
each morning of old catos principles
a good draught next your heart that walk upon
till it be well digested then come home
and taste a piece of terence suck his phrase
instead of liquorice and at any hand
shun plautus and old ennius they are meats
too harsh for a weak stomach
use to read but not without a tutor the best greeks
as orpheus musaeus pindarus
hesiod callimachus and theocrite
high homer but beware of lycophron
he is too dark and dangerous a dish
you must not hunt for wild outlandish terms
to stuff out a peculiar dialect
but let your matter run before your words
and if at any time you chance to meet
some gallobelgic phrase you shall not straight
rack your poor verse to give it entertainment
but let it pass and do not think yourself
much damnified if you do leave it out
when nor your understanding nor the sense
could well receive it this fair abstinence
in time will render you more sound and clear
and this have i prescribed to you in place
of a strict sentence which till he perform
attire him in that robe and henceforth learn
to bear yourself more humbly not to swell
or breathe your insolent and idle spite
on him whose laughter can your worst affright

tib
take him away

cris
jupiter guard caesar

virg
and for a week or two see him lockd up
in some dark place removed from company
he will talk idly else after his physic
now to you sir to demetrius the extremity of law
awards you to be branded in the front
for this your calumny but since it pleaseth
horace the party wrongd t intreat of caesar
a mitigation of that juster doom
with caesars tongue thus we pronounce your sentence
demetrius fannius thou shalt here put on
that coat and cap and henceforth think thyself
no other than they make thee vow to wear them
in every fair and generous assembly
till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge
as well thy satisfaction as thy wrongs

hor
only grave praetor here in open court
i crave the oath for good behaviour
may be administerd unto them both

virg
horace it shall tibullus give it them

tib
rufus laberius crispinus and demetrius fannius lay your
hands on your hearts you shall here solemnly attest and swear
that never after this instant either at booksellers stalls in
taverns twopenny rooms tyringhouses noblemens butteries
puisents chambers the best and farthest places where you are
admitted to come you shall once offer or dare thereby to endear
yourself the more to any player enghle or guilty gull in your
company to malign traduce or detract the person or writings of
quintus horatius flaccus or any other eminent men transcending
you in merit whom your envy shall find cause to work upon either
for that or for keeping himself in better acquaintance or
enjoying better friends or if transported by any sudden and
desperate resolution you do that then you shall not under the
batoon or in the next presence being an honourable assembly of
his favourers be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the
forswearing of it neither shall you at any time ambitiously
affecting the title of the untrussers or whippers of the age
suffer the itch of writing to overrun your performance in libel
upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit and losing both
your time and your papers be irrecoverably forfeited to the
hospital of fools so help you our roman gods and the genius of
great caesar

virg
so now dissolve the court

bor tib gal mec
and thanks to caesar that thus hath exercised his patience

caes
we have indeed you worthiest friends of caesar
it is the bane and torment of our ears
to hear the discords of those jangling rhymers
that with their bad and scandalous practices
bring all true arts and learning in contempt
but let not your high thoughts descend so low
as these despised objects let them fall
with their flat grovelling souls be you yourselves
and as with our best favours you stand crownd
so let your mutual loves be still renownd
envy will dwell where there is want of merit
though the deserving man should crack his spirit

blush folly blush heres none that fears
the wagging of an asss ears
although a wolfish case he wears
detraction is but baseness varlet
and apes are apes though clothed in scarlet

there are to whom i seem excessive sour

what shall i do trebatius say

treb
surcease

hor
and shall my muse admit no more increase

treb
so i advise

hor
an ill death let me die
if twere not best but sleep avoids mine eye
and i use these lest nights should tedious seem

treb
rather contend to sleep and live like them
that holding golden sleep in special price
rubbd with sweet oils swim silver tyber thrice
and every even with neat wine steeped be
or if such love of writing ravish thee
then dare to sing unconquerd caesars deeds
who cheers such actions with abundant meeds

hor
that father i desire but when i try
i feel defects in every faculty
nor ist a labour fit for every pen
to paint the horrid troops of armed men
the lances burst in gallias slaughterd forces
or wounded parthians tumbled from their horses
great caesars wars cannot be fought with words

treb
yet what his virtue in his peace affords
his fortitude and justice thou canst shew
as wise lucilius honourd scipio

hor
of that my powers shall suffer no neglect
when such slight labours may aspire respect
but if i watch not a most chosen time
the humble words of flaccus cannot climb
th attentive ear of caesar nor must i
with less observance shun gross flattery
for he reposed safe in his own merit
spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit

treb
but how much better would such accents sound
than with a sad and serious verse to wound
pantolabus railing in his saucy jests
or nomentanus spent in riotous feasts
in satires each man though untouchd complains
as he were hurt and hates such biting strains

hor
what shall i do milonius shakes his heels
in ceaseless dances when his brain once feels
the stirring fervour of the wine ascend
and that his eyes false numbers apprehend
castor his horse pollux loves handyfights
a thousand heads a thousand choice delights
my pleasure is in feet my words to close
as both our better old lucilius does
he as his trusty friends his books did trust
with all his secrets nor in things unjust
or actions lawful ran to other men
so that the old mans life described was seen
as in a votive table in his lines
and to his steps my genius inclines
lucanian or apulian i know not whether
for the venusian colony ploughs either
sent thither when the sabines were forced thence
as old fame sings to give the place defence
gainst such as seeing it empty might make road
upon the empire or there fix abode
whether the apulian borderer it were
or the lucanian violence they fear—
but this my style no living man shall touch
if first i be not forced by base reproach
but like a sheathed sword it shall defend
my innocent life for why should i contend
to draw it out when no malicious thief
robs my good name the treasure of my life
o jupiter let it with rust be eaten
before it touch or insolently threaten
the life of any with the least disease
so much i love and woo a general peace
but he that wrongs me better i proclaim
he never had assayd to touch my fame
for he shall weep and walk with every tongue
throughout the city infamously sung
servius the praetor threats the laws and urn
if any at his deeds repine or spurn
the witch canidia that albutius got
denounceth witchcraft where she loveth not
thurius the judge doth thunder worlds of ill
to such as strive with his judicial will
all men affright their foes in what they may
nature commands it and men must obey
observe with me the wolf his tooth doth use
the bull his horn and who doth this infuse
but nature theres luxurious scaeva trust
his longlived mother with him his so just
and scrupulous righthand no mischief will
no more than with his heel a wolf will kill
or ox with jaw marry let him alone
with temperd poison to remove the croan
but briefly if to age i destined be
or that quick deaths black wings environ me
if rich or poor at rome or fate command
i shall be banished to some other land
what hue soever my whole state shall bear
i will write satires still in spite of fear

treb
horace i fear thou drawst no lasting breath
and that some great mans friend will be thy death

hor
what when the man that first did satirise
durst pull the skin over the ears of vice
and make who stood in outward fashion clear
give place as foul within shall i forbear
did laelius or the man so great with fame
that from sackd carthage fetchd his worthy name
storm that lucilius did metellus pierce
or bury lupus quick in famous verse
rulers and subjects by whole tribes he checkt
but virtue and her friends did still protect
and when from sight or from the judgmentseat
the virtuous scipio and wise laelius met
unbraced with him in all light sports they shared
till their most frugal suppers were prepared
whateer i am though both for wealth and wit
beneath lucilius i am pleased to sit
yet envy spite of her empoisond breast
shall say i lived in grace here with the best
and seeking in weak trash to make her wound
shall find me solid and her teeth unsound
less learnd trebatius censure disagree

treb
no horace i of force must yield to thee
only take heed as being advised by me
lest thou incur some danger better pause
than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws
theres justice and great action may be sued
gainst such as wrong mens fames with verses lewd

hor
ay with lewd verses such as libels be
and aimd at persons of good quality
i reverence and adore that just decree
but if they shall be sharp yet modest rhymes
that spare mens persons and but tax their crimes
such shall in open court find current pass
were caesar judge and with the makers grace

treb
nay ill add more if thou thyself being clear
shall tax in person a man fit to bear
shame and reproach his suit shall quickly be
dissolved in laughter and thou thence set free

                                                to the reader

if by looking on what is past thou hast deserved that name i am
willing thou shouldst yet know more by that which follows an
apologetical dialogue which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer i ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out and some yet remaining against me and this play wherein i take no pleasure to revive the times but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then and mine that neglected them ever for in these strifes and on such persons were as wretched to affect a victory as it is unhappy to be committed with them

            non annorum canities est laudanda sed morum
                                 scene the authors lodgings
                              enter nasutus and polyposus
nas
i pray you let s go see him how he looks
after these libels

pol
o vexd vexd i warrant you

nas do you think so i should be sorry for him
if i found that

pol
o they are such bitter things
he cannot choose

nas
but is he guilty of them

pol
fuh thats no matter

nas
no

pol
no heres his lodging
well steal upon him or lets listen stay
he has a humour oft to talk t himself

nas
they are your manners lead me not mine own

they come forward the scene opens and discovers the
author in his study
aut
the fates have not spun him the coarsest thread
that free from knots of perturbation
doth yet so live although but to himself
as he can safely scorn the tongues of slaves
and neglect fortune more than she can him
it is the happiest thing this not to be
within the reach of malice it provides
a man so well to laugh off injuries
and never sends him farther for his vengeance
than the vexd bosom of his enemy
i now but think how poor their spite sets off
who after all their waste of sulphurous terms
and burstout thunder of their charged mouths
have nothing left but the unsavoury smoke
of their black vomit to upbraid themselves
whilst i at whom they shot sit here shotfree
and as unhurt of envy as unhit

pol and nas discover themselves
pol
ay but the multitude they think not so sir
they think you hit and hurt and dare give out
your silence argues it in not rejoining
to this or that late libel

aut
las good rout
i can afford them leave to err so still
and like the barking students of bearscollege
to swallow up the garbage of the time
with greedy gullets whilst myself sit by
pleased and yet tortured with their beastly feeding
tis a sweet madness runs along with them
to think all that are aimd at still are struck
then where the shaft still lights make that the mark
and so each fear or fevershaken fool
may challenge teucers hand in archery
good troth if i knew any man so vile
to act the crimes these whippers reprehend
or what their servile apes gesticulate
i should not then much muse their shreds were liked
since ill men have a lust t hear others sins
all good men have a zeal to hear sin shamed
but when it is all excrement they vent
base filth and offal or thefts notable
as oceanpiracies or highwaystands
and not a crime there taxd but is their own
or what their own foul thoughts suggested to them
and that in all their heat of taxing others
not one of them but lives himself if known
improbior satiram scribente cinaedo
what should i say more than turn stone with wonder

nas
i never saw this play bred all this tumult
what was there in it could so deeply offend
and stir so many hornets

aut
shall i tell you

nas
yea and ingeniously

aut
then by the hope
which i prefer unto all other objects
i can profess i never writ that piece
more innocent or empty of offence
some salt it had but neither tooth nor gall
nor was there in it any circumstance
which in the setting down i could suspect
might be perverted by an enemys tongue
only it had the fault to be calld mine
that was the crime

pol
no why they say you taxd
the law and lawyers captains and the players
by their particular names

aut
it is not so
i used no name my books have still been taught
to spare the persons and to speak the vices
these are mere slanders and enforced by such
as have no safer ways to mens disgraces
but their own lies and loss of honesty
fellows of practised and most laxative tongues
whose empty and eager bellies in the year
compel their brains to many desperate shifts
i spare to name them for their wretchedness
fury itself would pardon these or such
whether of malice or of ignorance
or itch t have me their adversary i know not
or all these mixt but sure i am three years
they did provoke me with their petulant styles
on every stage and i at last unwilling
but weary i confess of so much trouble
thought i would try if shame could win upon em
and therefore chose augustus caesars times
when wit and area were at their height in rome
to shew that virgil horace and the rest
of those great masterspirits did not want
detractors then or practicers against them
and by this line although no parallel
i hoped at last they would sit down and blush
but nothing i could find more contrary
and though the impudence of flies be great
yet this hath so provokd the angry wasps
or as you said of the next nest the hornets
that they fly buzzing mad about my nostrils
and like so many screaming grasshoppers
held by the wings fill every ear with noise
and what those former calumnies you mentiond
first of the law indeed i brought in ovid
chid by his angry father for neglecting
the study of their laws for poetry
and i am warranted by his own words

saepe pater dixit studium quid inutile tentas
maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes

and in far harsher terms elsewhere as these

non me verbosas leges ediscere non me
ingrato voces prostituisse foro

but how this should relate unto our laws
or the just ministers with least abuse
i reverence both too much to understand
then for the captain i will only speak
an epigram i here have made it is

unto true soldiers
thats the lemma mark it
strength of my country whilst i bring to view
such as are misscalld captains and wrong you
and your high names i do desire that thence
be nor put on you nor you take offence
i swear by your true friend my muse i love
your great profession which i once did prove
and did not shame it with my actions then
no more than i dare now do with my pen
he that not trusts me having vowed thus much
buts angry for the captain still is such
now for the players it is true i taxd them
and yet but some and those so sparingly
as all the rest might have sat still unquestiond
had they but had the wit or conscience
to think well of themselves but impotent they
thought each mans vice belongd to their whole tribe
and much good dot them what they have done gainst me
i am not moved with if it gave them meat
or got them clothes tis well that was their end
only amongst them i am sorry for
some better natures by the rest so drawn
to run in that vile line

pol
and is this all
will you not answer then the libels

aut
no

pol
nor the untrussers

aut
neither

pol
yare undone then

aut
with whom

pol
the world

aut
the bawd

pol
it will be taken
to be stupidity or tameness in you

aut
but they that have incensed me can in soul
acquit me of that guilt they know i dare
to spurn or baffle them or squirt their eyes
with ink or urine or i could do worse
armd with archilochus fury write iambics
should make the desperate lashers hang themselves
rhime them to death as they do irish rats
in drumming tunes or living i could stamp
their foreheads with those deep and public brands
that the whole company of barbersurgeon a
should not take off with all their art and plasters
and these my prints should last still to be read
in their pale fronts when what they write gainst me
shall like a figure drawn in water fleet
and the poor wretched papers be employed
to clothe tobacco or some cheaper drug
this i could do and make them infamous
but to what end when their own deeds have markd em
and that i know within his guilty breast
each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him
worse than a million of these temporal plagues
which to pursue were but a feminine humour
and far beneath the dignity of man

nas
tis true for to revenge their injuries
were to confess you felt them let them go
and use the treasure of the fool their tongues
who makes his gain by speaking worst of beat

pol
o but they lay particular imputations—

aut
as what

pol
that all your writing is mere railing

aut
ha
if all the salt in the old comedy
should be so censured or the sharper wit
of the bold satire termed scolding rage
what age could then compare with those for buffoons
what should be said of aristophanes
persius or juvenal whose names we now
so glorify in schools at least pretend it—
have they no other

pol
yes they say you are slow
and scarce bring forth a play a year

aut
tis true
i would they could not say that i did that
there s all the joy that i take in their trade
unless such scribes as these might be proscribed
th abused theatres they would think it strange now
a man should take but coltsfoot for one day
and between whiles spit out a better poem
than eer the master of art or giver of wit
their belly made yet this is possible
if a free mind had but the patience
to think so much together and so vile
but that these base and beggarly conceits
should carry it by the multitude of voices
against the most abstracted work opposed
to the stuffd nostrils of the drunken rout
o this would make a learnd and liberal soul
to rive his stained quill up to the back
and damn his longwatchd labours to the fire
things that were born when none but the still night
and his dumb candle saw his pinching throes
were not his own free merit a more crown
unto his travails than their reeling claps
this tis that strikes me silent seals my lips
and apts me rather to sleep out my time
than i would waste it in contemned strifes
with these vile ibides these unclean birds
that make their mouths their clysters and still purge
from their hot entrails but i leave the monsters
to their own fate and since the comic muse
hath proved so ominous to me i will try
if tragedy have a more kind aspect
her favours in my next i will pursue
where if i prove the pleasure but of one
so he judicious be he shall be alone
a theatre unto me once ill say
to strike the ear of time in those fresh strains
as shall beside the cunning of their ground
give cause to some of wonder some despite
and more despair to imitate their sound
i that spend half my nights and all my days
here in a cell to get a dark paleface
to come forth worth the ivy or the bays
and in this age can hope no other grace—
leave me theres something come into my thought
that must and shall be sung high and aloof
safe from the wolfs black jaw and the dun asss hoof

nas
i reverence these raptures and obey them
