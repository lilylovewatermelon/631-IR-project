we may not have all the answers
oh i know that we can change some of the things that are beyond our control
and the vision of us may be blurry but use your heart to see
just follow the beat
the rhythm will lead you right back to me

prechorus
sometimes its a game of give and take
its easy to break but hold on and wait
have a little faith

chorus
i will go down to the last round
ill be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
so ill stand up tall if by chance i fall
then ill go down as a casualty of love

postchorus
love love love love
casualty
love love love love
casualty
casualty of a casualty of love

verse 2
the battle of us could be simple
escape without being hurt
cause love is our shield
keeps us concealed from what could get even worse
so baby let me be your soldier
dont be overtaken by pride
just close your eyes take my hand
promise to keep us alive

through the fire and rain
it makes me numb from the pain
thats the price thats the price ill pay
