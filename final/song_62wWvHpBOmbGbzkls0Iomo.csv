when you gonna give it up
youre giving me such a rush
come on holly would you turn me on
when you gonna give it up
youre giving me such a rush
come on holly would you turn me on

verse 1
you are the taste of something sweet
and im tangled in the sheets
you left your mark dragged down my back
so chain me up im in too deep
too much of you is never enough

chorus
when you gonna give it up
youre giving me such a rush
come on holly would you turn me on
just another pretty face
but i want one more taste
come on holly would you turn me on

verse 2
just one fix to keep me in the mix
and im still strung out on you
drove all night
im the deer in your headlights
whats left of me youll swallow soon
too much of you is never enough

so when you gonna give it up
youre giving me such a rush
come on holly would you turn me on
just another pretty face
but i want one more taste
come on holly would you turn me on

you took what you wanted
you got it you know it
im haunted by everything that you gave me
you made me you broke me you saved me
im crazy but im not done

chorus
so when you gonna give it up
youre giving me such a rush
come on holly would you turn me on
just another pretty face
but i want one more taste
come on holly would you turn me on

outro
when you gonna give it up
you took what you wanted
youre giving me such a rush
you got it you know it
come on holly would you turn me on
im haunted by everything that you gave me
just another pretty face
you made me you broke me you saved me
but i want one more taste
come on holly would you turn me onembed"
