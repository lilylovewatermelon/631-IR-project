used to spend my nights out in a barroom
liquor was the only love id known
but you rescued me from reachin for the bottom
and brought me back from bein too far gone

chorus
youre as smooth as tennessee whiskey
youre as sweet as strawberry wine
youre as warm as a glass of brandy
and honey i stay stoned on your love all the time

verse 2
ive looked for love in all the same old places
found the bottom of a bottles always dry
but when you poured out your heart i didnt waste it
cause theres nothin like your love to get me high

chorus
and youre as smooth as tennessee whiskey
youre as sweet as strawberry wine
youre as warm as a glass of brandy
and honey i stay stoned on your love all the time
