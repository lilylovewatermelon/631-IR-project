tied down against the tracks
screaming in silent black and white
whyd you trust us we are such villains
we would tell ourselves anything
we want to hear if we are willing
to listen is to learn
then too much is what we deserve

prechorus
and how come when we say that we do
we dont
pray to anybody you want
we wont

chorus
but if were the ones to blame then the fruit
shouldnt taste so good we were used
used to thinking we got nothing to lose
were losing everything but the truth
walking straight into a roadblock
ending left here bending
your point of view was chosen by the serpents ruse

verse 2
with all its dos and donts
the future is an empty promise
unconcerned and so tired of waiting
we could sell it wooden horses
full of nightmares and when they open
this all might recompose
theres no going back to the good old days
its just a phase bring in some new life
archaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
if were the ones to blame then the fruit
shouldnt taste so good we were used
used to thinking we got nothing to lose
were losing everything but the truth
walking straight into a roadblock
ending left here bending
your point of view was chosen by the serpents ruse

outro
and how come when we say we do we dont
how come when we say we will we wont1embed"
