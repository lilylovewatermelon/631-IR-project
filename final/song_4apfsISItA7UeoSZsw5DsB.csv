if youre feeling like i feel then run your life like its a dance floor
and if you need a little heat in your face thats what im here for
if youre chilling in the dark and youre looking through a telescope
you will see me sipping on a soul of a new hope

verse 2
if youre feeling like i feel throw your fist through the ceiling
some people call it crazy well i call it healing
if you need love turn around do the helicopter
if youre sick baby girl i would love to be your doctor
