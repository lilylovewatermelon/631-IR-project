start up the engine were heavy and rolling
tankful of gas and the night is young
dont know you
dont care where you’re going
to the highline or the heart of the sun
my sweet companion is long as the summer
black as the river and built to glide
smooth as glass
smooth as marcus miller
cold as ice when you climb inside

chorus andrew wyatt
when the citys flowing
i found a way to move my weary soul
ridin straight and low
stay heavy and rolling

verse 2 andrew wyatt
you deal in ducats you deal in illusion
pay for pleasure with your pretty face
you confuse
war and prostitution
in my starship i sail freely through space

chorus andrew wyatt
when the citys flowing
i found a way to move my weary soul
ridin straight and low
stay heavy and rolling
you might also likeverse 3 andrew wyatt
i was lost and lonely like you
holloweyed and broken inside
then i found something lasting and true
a beautiful ride
might have to wait to start in on your drinking
all of hell’s kitchen’s standing in that line
i’ll be here
living in my lincoln
occupying space and conquering time

chorus andrew wyatt
when the citys flowing
i found a way to move my weary soul
ridin straight and low
stay heavy and rollingembed"
