the sutures in my head keep getting ripped out
these open wounds are the thoughts i cant stop thinking about
digging for purpose feelings resurface
and involuntarily my system gets nervous
tell me tonight that youll be by yourself
cause something bad will happen if you are with someone else
im just all fucked up and i really need your help
i really need your help
theres a lot of hollow souls out there all alone
and theyre waiting for you to invite them back into my home
they touched and they took what was rightfully mine
now im the devil and their souls just went up in price

chorus
set me free i think im giving up
dont wait for me i think ive had enough
set me free i think im giving up
dont wait for me ive had enough enough now

verse 2
i pour myself to sleep into a glass that you keep
and thats all ill ever be if you dont set me free
i know its hard but ill be damned if i live in your hands
so please put me down so i dont feel a thing
my pretty little face with all the right parts
my pretty little face i couldnt keep from the dark
i learned from the best as my sorrows grew
and then they pulled me out after i introduced em to you
were just two wrong souls that met at the wrong time
so just go your way and ill go mine
youll be alone with someone new until the day that you die
and ill watch from afar to make sure youre alright
