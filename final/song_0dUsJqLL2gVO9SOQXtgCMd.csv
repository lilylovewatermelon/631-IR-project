a couple of guys in first class on a flight
from new york to los angeles
kinda making small talk killing time
flirting with the flight attendants
thirtythousand feet above could be oklahoma

verse 2
just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
man it all looks the same
miles and miles of back roads and highways
connecting little towns with funny names
whod want to live down there in the middle of nowhere

verse 3
theyve never drove through indiana
met the men who plowed that earth
planted that seed busted his ass for you and me
or caught a harvest moon in kansas
theyd understand why god made
those flyover states

verse 4
i bet that mile long santa fe freight train engineers seen it all
just like that flatbed cowboy stacking us steel on a 3day haul
roads and rails under their feet
yeah that sounds like a first class seat
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likeverse 5
on the plains of oklahoma
with a windshield sunset in your eyes
like a watercolored painted sky
youll think heavens doors have opened
youll understand why god made
those flyover states

verse 6
take a ride across the badlands
feel that freedom on your face
breathe in all that open space
and meet a girl from amarillo
youll understand why god made
you might even wanna plant your stakes
in those flyover states
yeah

outro
have you ever been through indiana
on the plains of oklahoma
take a ride7embed"
