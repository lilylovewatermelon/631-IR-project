i wanna be alone
alone with you does that make sense
i wanna steal your soul
and hide you in my treasure chest
i dont know what to do
to do with your kiss on my neck
i dont know what feels true
but this feels right so stay a sec
yeah you feel right so stay a sec

chorus
and let me crawl inside your veins
ill build a wall give you a ball and chain
its not like me to be so mean youre all i wanted
just let me hold you
like a hostage

verse 2
gold on your fingertips
fingertips against my cheek
gold leaf across your lips
kiss me until i cant speak
gold chain beneath your shirt
the shirt that you let me wear home
golds fake and real love hurts
but nothing hurts when im alone
when youre with me and were alone

and let me crawl inside your veins
ill build a wall give you a ball and chain
its not like me to be so mean youre all i wanted
just let me hold you
hold you
like a hostage
like a hostage91embed"
