aah aah

verse 1
can i wait the hours til you find me
climb up to the tower so that you could see
violence in the flowers where they found you
can i wait the hours
would it be untrue
climb up to the tower so that you could see
all across the hours

chorus
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind dont care about me
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind dont leave without me
frightened eyes

verse 2
made in your reflection so that you could feel
mad in your intentions fear it isnt real
all the recollections spinning in a field
left in your possession til it isnt real
you say it isnt real
you might also likechorus
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind dont care about me
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind dont leave without me
frightened eyes

outro
deeper than you and me
its farther than you could see
is it too much to ask tell me
its all in a glance youll see
its deeper than you and me looking back at me
its all in a glance youll see dont care about me
its farther than we could be looking back at me
its deeper than you and me dont care about me
frightened eyes14embed"
