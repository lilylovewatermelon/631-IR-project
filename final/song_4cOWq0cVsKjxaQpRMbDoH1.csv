please picture me in the trees
i hit my peak at seven
feet in the swing over the creek
i was too scared to jump in
but i i was high in the sky
with pennsylvania under me
are there still beautiful things

chorus
sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart wont tell no other
and though i cant recall your face
i still got love for you
your braids make a pattern
love you to the moon and to saturn
passed down like folk songs
the love lasts so long

verse 2
and ive been meaning to tell you
i think your house is haunted
your dad is always mad and that must be why
and i think you should come live with me
and we can be pirates
then you wont have to cry
or hide in the closet
and just like a folk song
our love will be passed on
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge

before i learned civility
i used to scream ferociously
any time i wanted

chorus
sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart wont tell no other
and though i cant recall your face

passed down like folk songs
the love lasts so longembed"
