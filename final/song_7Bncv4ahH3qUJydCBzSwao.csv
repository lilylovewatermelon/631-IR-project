sing it for me
i cant erase the stupid things i say
youre better than me
i struggle just to find a better way

chorus
so here we are
fighting and trying to hide the scars
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road
the one that i should try to walk alone
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye

verse 2
you wouldnt like me
keep moving on until forever ends
dont try to fight me
the beauty queen has lost her crown again

chorus
so here we are
fighting and trying to hide the scars
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road
the one that i should try to walk alone
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye
see breaking benjamin liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likebridge
so why are you so eager to betray
pick the pieces up pick the pieces up
so why are you the one that walks away
pick the pieces up pick the pieces up

chorus
so here we are
fighting and trying to hide the scars
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road
the one that i should try to walk alone
ill be home tonight
take a breath and softly say goodbye4embed"
