imagine me there by your side
its so hard to be here so far away from you
im counting the days till
im finally done
im counting them down yeah one by one
it feels like forever till i return to you
but it helps me on those lonely nights
its that one thing that keeps me alive

chorus
knowing that you wait for me
ever so patiently

no one else knows the feeling inside
we hang up the phone without saying goodnight
because its the sound of your voice that brings me home
its never been easy to say
but its easier when ive gone away

chorus
knowing that you wait for me
ever so patiently
yeah youre everything ive ever dreamed of having and
its everything i need from you just knowing that you wait for me
