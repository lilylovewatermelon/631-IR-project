you say that youve been missing me
every single time were not together
and i know that ive been gone from everything
but i needed that
say you wish that you were kissing me
it comes out of nowhere whenever
but im kinda sick and tired youre so selfish
say that im not coming back to you

prechorus
but wait dont leave
hate that its so easy for you
wait i cant see
try to walk away

chorus
i keep fallin for the bad ones bad ones
the always make me sad ones sad ones
tryin hard to hold my ground
but it always ties me down
yeah the bad ones
way too good at fallin for the bad ones

verse 2
youre really good at tricking me
makin me believe im not enough
and im always so confident
til you come and trip me up
why you so caught up with fixing me
you know thats something that i really hate
youre the only thing about me that should change
youre my one mistake hmm
