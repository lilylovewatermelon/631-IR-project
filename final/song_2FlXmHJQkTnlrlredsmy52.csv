maybe the love on a lifetime or a living hell
i guess what im trying to say is we gotta figure it out
what were gonna sing about what were gonna sing about
oh yeah alright

somebody gonna sing the blues about being done wrong
the pain and the sorrow is too much to overcome
then i hear  sing about the one thing he knows
sing about love

everybody got a song to sing they got a story to tell
about the love of your life or a living hell
i guess what im trying to say we gotta figure it out
we got a choice to make boy what you gonna sing about

i saw a little bird with a broken wing
she aint ever gonna fly but she sure gonna sing
about the blue sky not about missing out
i wanna be that bird

raise your voice close your eyes
and find the melody
brothers and sisters let it ring out

what were gonna sing about
what were gonna sing about
yeah i guess what im trying to say
is what were gonna sing about were gonna sing about
yeah yeah
