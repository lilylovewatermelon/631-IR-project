i used to know you when we were young
you were in all my dreams
we sat together in period one
fridays at 815
now i see your face in the strangest places
movies and magazines
i saw you talking to christopher walken
on my tv screen

chorus
but i will wait for you
as long as i need to
and if you ever get back to hackensack
ill be here for you

verse 2
i used to work in a record store
now i work for my dad
scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
the hours are pretty bad
sometimes i wonder where you are
probably in la
that seems to be where
everybody else ends up these days
you might also likechorus
but i will wait for you
as long as i need to
and if you ever get back to hackensack
ill be here for you

bridge

chorus
and i will wait for you
as long as i need to
and if you ever get back to hackensack
ill be here for you
if you ever get back to hackensack
ill be here for youembed"
