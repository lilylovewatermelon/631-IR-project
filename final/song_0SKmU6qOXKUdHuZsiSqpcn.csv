oh lord wont you please just let this honky tonk stay open
cause i have no place to go come closing time
and all my friends are here and i just need to keep on soaking
all the deep and dark recesses of my mind

chorus
and id rather be here than anywhere that i can think of
and im probably gonna be here until they throw me out
cause last call dont mean not one damn thing to me
its just another cue for me to go get my next round

verse 2
oh lord wont you please make sure that jukebox dont quit playing
and make sure that keg aint floating in the back
cause i still got room for one more and my dancing shoes are on
and i got a few more hours before i got to hit the sack

chorus
and id rather be here than anywhere that i can think of
and im probably gonna be here until they throw me out
cause the last call dont mean not one damn thing to me
its just another cue for me to go get my next round

chorus
and id rather be here than anywhere that i can think of
and im probably gonna be here until they throw me out
cause last call dont mean not one damn thing to me
well its just another cue for me to go get my next round
well its just another cue for me to go get my next round
well its just another cue for me to go get my next roundyou might also likeembed"
