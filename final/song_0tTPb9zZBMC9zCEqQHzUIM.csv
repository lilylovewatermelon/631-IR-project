ooh

anything she want for some kisses
im cookin for her when she gets hungry
all she doin is actin like she want me
she cuttin off all my homies
even all my other ronis
she aint even my main lady

verse 2
so we went our separate ways
its been a couple of days
but now im doin what i want to
with nobody tellin me what im gon do
and im feelin so free
with nobody but me
now i can handle all my business
all of my fellas can i get a witness
but im feelin kinda lonely
on top of that im kinda horny
and i gotta get back to her
now im leavin quickly
before she come and try to get me
and im takin everything with me
well it all come down to her
