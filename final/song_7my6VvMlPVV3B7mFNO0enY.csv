theres no trouble in this town
but by god i wish id find some
sometimes in life what you wanna do
isnt necessarily what youre gonna do
yup
everyone fell fast and hard around here
like uh snake oil with a hefty price tag
hitchin a ride the desert wont hide me no more
let me tell you somethin son
if theres gonna be a showdown hitchin a ride
you better not turn your back the desert wont hide me no more
oh and uh dont forget to tip your queen hitchin a ride
the desert wont hide me no more
hitchin a ride the desert wont hide me no more
hitchin a ride the desert wont hide me no moresee diplo liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likeembed"
