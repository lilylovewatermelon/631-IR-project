mercurys in retrograde
dont believe a thing i say
you know i dont believe that stuff
my minds only made of dust
the echo always said get real
mostly i just go by feel
kick it first if it dont start
dont need tools i got my heart

chorus
are we free or afraid of what were told
are we out of or under control

verse 2
when saturn returns i begin
to trust in patterns more than men
or the stories that they tell
even when they tell them well
the echo always sounded good
until i finally understood
i only had to open the door
now i dont trust the echo anymore

chorus
are we free or afraid of what were told
are we out of or under control

all these planets pulling me around
they pulled my face into a frown
even though my minds made up
my minds only made of dust
from stars and clouds and oceans all unseen
from stars and clouds and oceans all unseen

chorus
are we free or afraid of what were told
are we out of or under control1embed"
