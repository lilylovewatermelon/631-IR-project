i know i hurt you i was so unkind
i was ungrateful i wasted your time
but i was young and lost so lost
see you took this poor boy and changed his whole life
granted his wishes and dreams overnight
and i saw stars they shot me down
but i deserved it they knocked me out

chorus
im just waking up now in the tears of the ones i love
its quiet ill bet that everybody thinks im done
i need to get up now ive been down here far too long
two years ive been lost now i remember who i was
who i was who i was

verse 2
i am the one who beat me black and blue
no one can hurt all your feelings like you
whoa i know it or validate
see if youre a misfit and feel out of place
or you dont like how you look its okay
cause someone will but you need to love yourself
dont end up like me dont end up like me

chorus
im just waking up now in the tears of the ones i love
its quiet ill bet that everybody thinks im done
i need to get up now ive been down here for too long
two years ive been lost now i remember who i was
who i was who i was ive been down here for too
who i was who i wassee james arthur liveget tickets as low as 50you might also like2embed"
