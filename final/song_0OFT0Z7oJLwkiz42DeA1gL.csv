if i send you roses for no reason at all
if out of the blue i stop and give you a call
once in a while it is breakfast in bed
and then pull the covers back up over our heads

verse 2
if i call in sick just to stay home with you
i want you to know why i do what i do
it is my way of saying what i cannot express
but i want you to know girl i am doing my best

chorus
oh i am just a man that is the way i was made
i am not too good at saying what you need me to say
it is always right there on the tip of my tongue
it might go unsaid but it would not go undone
so when those three little words come so easy to you
i hope you know what i mean when i say me too

verse 3
if you should wake up and catch me watching you sleep
and i break the silence by kissing your cheek
if i whisper something you do not understand
do not make me repeat it i do not know if i can
you might also likechorus
oh i am just a man that is the way i was made
i am not too good at saying what you need me to say
it is always right there on the tip of my tongue
it might go unsaid but it would not go undone
so when those three little words come so easy to you
i hope you know what i mean when i say me too

outro
me too me too hope you know what i mean when i say
me too me tooembed"
