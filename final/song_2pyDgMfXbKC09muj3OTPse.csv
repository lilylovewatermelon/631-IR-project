she wore crushed velvet jet black and to the floor
she rode on angels wings that used to shine oh so bright
now the dark has caught the spark in her eyes
and i i cant find the air

prechorus casey calvert
ill wait for you i cross my heart

chorus jt woodruff casey calvert
dissolve and decay
theres nothing left for me right now

verse 2 jt woodruff with matt ridenour
walk slowly towards the light
shes calling and im falling down
shes crying and i am lying about last night
she cant find a way to tell me
i cant find the air

prechorus casey calvert
ill wait for you i cross my heart

chorus jt woodruff casey calvert
dissolve and decay
theres nothing left for me right now
this fires dying down
theres nothing left to see right now

right now

bridge matt ridenour jt woodruff
dissolve and decay
theres nothing left for me
sit back and let her die slowly
dont cry she didnt love you anyway
dissolve and decay
theres nothing left for me
just try to make it out alive yeah
alive means your blood is flowing

adlibs casey calvert

chorus jt woodruff casey calvert

theres nothing left for me right now
this fires dying down
theres nothing left to see right nowembed"
