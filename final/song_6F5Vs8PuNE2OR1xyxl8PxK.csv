sail away
sail away with me
i dont have a ship
but we can get one easily
drift away
drift away with me
in a raft well make of memories
on an ocean we can call forevermore

prechorus
i wanna find
peace of your mind
i wanna see
your make believe
i dont wanna try so hard
i make it hard for you to breathe

chorus
jump into the ocean
leavin on a notion
if youre caught up in the motion
backtrack and do it again
and if you make it up
i could never get enough
me and you together
but youve gotta tell me where to begin

break away
break away from me
no forget that
just sit here and look at me
summers day
summer every day
watch the sunset come back up
and we know its never goin down again

prechorus
i wanna find
peace of your mind
i wanna see
your make believe
i dont wanna try so hard
i make it hard for you to breathe

chorus
jump into the ocean
leavin on a notion
if youre caught up in the motion
backtrack and do it again
and if you make it up
i could never get enough
me and you together
but youve gotta tell me where to begin
bridge
ive been savin up
to buy more time with you
youve been livin it up
with someone else
and thats ok
i know it
you know it too

chorus
jump into the ocean
leavin on a notion
if youre caught up in the motion
backtrack and do it again
and if you make it up
i could never get enough
me and you together
but youve gotta tell me where to begin
where to begin
youve gotta tell me where to beginembed"
