you arrive in my dream
beside me every night you and me
we explode through the scene
we try to drain the night empty

bridge
no one goes off in every way
like you do

verse 1
we go out together we weave our own web
tangled in the waves with you
we spray the scene in red
we both erupt in colors
then carve out our names
you keep me aroused
i know you feel the same

chorus
you arrive in my dream
beside me every night just you and me
we explode through the scene
we try to drain the night empty

bridge
no one else has a hold over me
like you do
you might also likeverse 2
you open up the covers you lure me in
tackle me anxious back into bed
well i hope to discover all of your waves
this place is death i know you feel the same

chorus
you arrive in my dream
beside me every night just you and me
we explode through the scene
we try to drain the night every wayembed"
