im sittin on my porch watching the law
as they ride past in they patrol cars
so tell me why i feel like the enemy
theyre supposed to be here protectin me
i might have went too far
helping to contribute to making they job hard
serving fiends like these people aint no enemy
i cant believe im out here killing my community
if you knew how far i came far i came
from where i am and where i used to be where i used to be
dont want it you can tell by the look at me
this gangsta life aint no longer in me

hook
and im tired of the runnin tired of the runnin
tired of the runnin runnin from the law
baby you gotta believe me
said im tired of the runnin tired of the runnin
tired of the runnin runnin from the law
baby you gotta believe me

verse 2
i know theres things i couldve changed girl
i know theres things i couldve done a lot better
instead im in the streets tryin to make that cheddar
thinking in my mind that you gon be there forever
i know i couldve let it all go let it all go
but i was thinking it would make life better
instead im sittin in this cell writing this letter
thought i wouldnt get caught ‘cause i was way too clever
i learned theres no one to catch you when youre fallin
and theyll be no one to hear you when youre callin
do you know what its like to wake up in the mornin
while youre starvin and youre hearing bugs crawlin
reminiscing on them days you was walkin
with pretty women on your arm while youre flossin
thankful that i didnt end up in a coffin
something you see too often

and im tired of the runnin tired of the runnin
tired of the runnin runnin from the law
baby you gotta believe me
said im tired of the runnin tired of the runnin
tired of the runnin runnin from the law
baby you gotta believe me2embed"
