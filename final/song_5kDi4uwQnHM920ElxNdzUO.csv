verse 1
i dont know why you bother
nothings ever good enough for you
i was there it wasnt like that
youve come here just to start a fight

chorus
you had to piss on our parade
you had to shred our big day
you had to ruin it for all concerned
in a drunken punchup at a wedding yeah

verse 2
hypocrite opportunist
dont infect me with your poison
a bully in a china shop
when i turn round you stay frozen to the spot
you might also likechorus
the pointless snide remarks
of hammerheaded sharks
the pot will call the kettle black
its a drunken punchup at a wedding yeah
