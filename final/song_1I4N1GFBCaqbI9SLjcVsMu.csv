good morning haha
wake your motherfucking asses up
are yall with us or what
well come on then you know what time it is
stop sleeping on my group bitch

verse 1 eminem
for whatever its worth its worth me havin my ass whipped
cause ima have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
i just cant get past these little piss ants
that wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they cant stand it
cause we can and they cant spit
and they cant handle it like a man
and thats when it just happens
and i snap and its a wrap and its scrap and then it isnt rap is it
hiphop isnt a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
maybe im oldfashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin without havin to slap him
believe me id much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when im pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
cause im tellin you right now youre not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then im pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit b
these words stick to you like krazy glue when you diss me
cause they just bounce off me like bullets to 50
im the beautifullest thing and you gonna miss me when im gone
like keith murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
i do this for swifty kon and kuniva bizzy and proof are you with me
you might also likechorus eminem
come on then everybody come on and
kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on in
cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
cause we aint leaving til 6 in the morning
so have a sing along with the words of the song and
if you dont know the words and you cant sing along then
fake like you know em motherfuckers and join in
everybody good morning

verse 2 swifty mcvay
they consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
in a party with heat its hard to keep me without one
fuck slugs im walkin gloves with a shotgun
constantly poppin slugs they hot son better not run aah
the bosses of all bosses a holocaust to whoever aint conscious
in a house full of dog shit
im a gothic death project you stop breathin
you die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
it aint about what you readin
when you meet me better speak like a seasons greetings
either that or well be beefin frequent
you niggas need an e just to speak shit
your leaders a petite bitch
keep the heater where you can reach quick
i snipe you with it and we wont even keep it a secret
nigga i did it from the mind of a mental patient
when glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
you brave
chorus eminem
come on then everybody come on and
kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on in
cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
cause we aint leaving til 6 in the morning
so have a sing along with the words of the song and
if you dont know the words and you cant sing along then
fake like you know em motherfuckers and join in
everybody good morning

verse 3 kon artis
i heard you niggas dont like us but so what
this beef is like what the fuck did he say in his rap em
i can see that hes just a punk
i mean these niggas squeeze on me
please im seeing guts
i dont need no enemies as my family a couple trucks and my mpc and a mic
they empty out on them bike to fight you
in front of every reporter that i dont like
no need for metaphors to get points across when i write
this emotions enough to say fuck you bitch and i dont like you
what i might as well give this up but thatd be selfish as fuck
to leave d12 in this but we cant selfdestruct
ive never felt it this much cmon fellas get up
we gotta fight like bugz last night of his life cmon
verse 4 kuniva
i walk with a limp pistol hanging off of the hip
im awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
your carcass is split even if beef is partially thick
we cant take you seriously you a comedy skit
you probably wish that you could be out shooting at gs
but the only thing you shoot is the breeze i cant believe
you speaking on moving keys but every time we hear you kick it
the only thing that you selling is woof tickets
i look wicked cause niggasll test your nutsack
so when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
and when they want it ill bring a hundred niggas from runyon so get to gunnin if you coming

chorus eminem
come on then everybody come on and
kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on in
cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
cause we aint leaving til 6 in the morning
so have a sing along with the words of the song and
if you dont know the words and you cant sing along then
fake like you know em motherfuckers and join in
everybody good morning9embed"
