ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
ready or not here we come here comes trouble in the club
eleven twelve thirteen pistols big as m16s
how the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
nina two ninas a piece they dont even see us
some shit pops off we squeeze each one
theyre gonna think its machine guns
vandalsvovandals bananas and old flannels
hands around our colt handles hold them like roman candles
so ban us go ban us bananafannafofannas
who come back all bananas banana clips loaded
managers bouncers and the club owners
the motherfuckers dont want us to come up bum rush in the club
and run up in it with a bunch of motherfuckers from runyon
steady popping them onions
ready set to go nut up prepare to tear the whole club up
fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
you know we finna locn when we mix coke with coconut rum up
so yeah yeah ho what up see my people posted up
see you talk that ho shit now when youre down you wont get up
and cant sit up youre so slit up the ambulance wont sew you up
they just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up

verse 2 swifty mcvay
i keep a shitload of bullets i pitbull it to pull it out
and automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth get closed
permanently you get burned to line quickly
you cannot hit me niggas too terrified to come get me
tempt me if you think swifty wont send a slug people run
when the reaper comes the repercussion gon equal blood
nigga what steppin without a weapon you leave you gone
i be still rollin with stolen toasters while on parole
snatch you out our home like eviction notices ho
when i unload im known to never leave witnesses to roam
when im blowed ill write the wickedest scroll ever told
when im sober im prone to roll up and disconnect your soul nigga
verse 3 kuniva
now its been proven its about to be a misunderstandin
and furniture movin bullets flyin lawyers and mothers suin
cause niggas dont know the difference
you bitches just stick to fiction
its sickening you cant even walk in my jurisdiction riffing it
gripping the pump
and who want to fuck with a walking psychopathic pyromaniac
shady cats with eighty gats
and maybe thats the reason that you gon get it the worst
and since you jumpin in front of everybody you gon get it first
i disperse the crowd with something bigger and versatile
so run and record your verses now while you got a mouth
and its not a joke its some kind of riddle
kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my acquittal
and a glock or two will stop you from walking
bulletsll hit your liver ill even shoot native americans
a indian giver and nigga
we back in your life and back in your wife
hit you in your back with a knife and get it crackin tonight

chorus eminem
