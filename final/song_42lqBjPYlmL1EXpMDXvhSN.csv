a bama red 4runner pulled into the party
with a 30a sticker on the back windshield
twotone tank top slippin off her shoulder
kinda girl when she steps out the world stands still

prechorus
ooh i know where this is goin
i already know it

chorus
shes somebodys problem somebodys goodbye
somebodys last call number that they cant find
somebodys best day somebodys worst night
somebodys reason for leavin on the porch light
thinkin bout them tan lines and im thinkin damn id
love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
shеs somebodys problem and somebodys problеms
about to be mine
about to be mine

verse 2
kinda girl once youve had her you cant stand to lose her
kinda girl where your friends tell you dont f it up
kinda girl that goes from tryin to just to get her number
to slidin through the summer to talkin bout love
