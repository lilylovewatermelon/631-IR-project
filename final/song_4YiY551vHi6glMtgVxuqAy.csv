verse
close i stare at my dreams as they approach
gotta be patient and trust in god he the coach
temptations are taking a shortcut but i dont
cause i aint tryna be a almost when i get it ima float
gone are the days we was close
now when i see you i look at you just like a ghost
a shell of your former self so caught up with that dope
two niggas singin two diffеrent notes and you know i gotta coast
nothin but a dollar and some hopе
up in ny but damn what hurts me the most
you was a good nigga we knew each others folks
now you gotta ride around with the toast and you keep that shit close
cause niggas plottin on you since you chose
to roll around with the candy paint on spokes
you know ville niggas dont like it when you boast
you know twelve be takin notes and they watchin you close
but maybe you dont see em cause the smoke
cloudin your vision from every cigar that you toke
plus the lean you sippin which started as a joke
got you now fiendin for your next dose meanwhile im so close
dont even give a fuck that im broke
cause in my mind im rich with shit i done wrote
therefore im convinced that this is supposed to happen
and in time ima blow they gon label me the goat
how long has it been since we spoke
last night i jumped up from my sleep i was soaked
call it a nightmare the scene that awoke me
involved you and niggas i aint know they was creepin up close
i saw the heat tucked in they coats
you didnt notice cause you was busy countin dough
i tried to yell but nothin came out of my throat
niggas cocked back the hammers and you froze in your eyes i saw hope
hope of a better way to cope with the pain
and the scars than the lean and the coke
and i swear in that moment i wish we were still close
maybe i couldve saved you but no trigger squeeze gun smoke
i opened up my eyes with a jolt
heart pumpin like usain bolt
reached for my phone missed calls and a text message note
from my mama sayin you just got smoked damn this life is no joke
