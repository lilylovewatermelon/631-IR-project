im nothing but a low life
thinking bout my own life
i cant help myself from falling
cant help myself from falling
im nothing but a low life
thinking bout my own life
im trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all im still just a low life

verse 1 jamie n commons
wanna be a better man but its a hard life
without that love inside you its a cold bind
i started to reflect on all thats been before
started to wonder but but you cant be sure

prechorus jamie n commons
now please tell me im broke
its much easier that way cause i just let you down
its much easier that way

chorus sam harris
im nothing but a low life
thinking bout my own life
i cant help myself from falling
cant help myself from falling
im nothing but a low life
thinking bout my own life
im trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all im still just a low life

its much easier that way cause i just let you down
its much easier that way
