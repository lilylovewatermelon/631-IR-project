i can hear those trucks on the highway tonight
i can hear those kids down the block playin ball
i can hear the drone of my boss in my head
sayin this weekend i need you on call
the volumes up the pressures on the phone is buzzin
youre the only reason that i dont go crazy

chorus
cause when we kiss the world outside is gone
and whatever longing there is moves on
my heart doesnt have any choice
when i hear my name on your voice
everything else everything else is just noise

verse 2
your eyes cut through every distraction
through the rage of the machine and the roar of the engines
this rock keeps turning this city dont sleep
youre my secret shelter when i cant find peace
the way you touch the way you whisper
way you love and how it lingers
you can make it all go away

chorus
cause when we kiss the world outside is gone
and whatever longing there is moves on
my heart doesnt have any choice
when i hear my name on your voice
everything else everything else is just noise

chorus
cause when we kiss the world outside is gone
and whatever longing there is moves on
my heart doesnt have any choice
when i hear my name on your voice
everything else everything else is just noise
everything else is just noiseembed"
