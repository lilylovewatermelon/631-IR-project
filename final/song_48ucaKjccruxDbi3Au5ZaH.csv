do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it wont make it that much easier
it might make it worse

verse 1
oh the nights like a whirlwind
somebodys girlfriends talking to me but its alright
shes saying that hes not gonna slap me or try to attack me
hes not the jealous type
and i only need to get half an excuse and im away
but when theres no excuses thats much easier to say
ive been before
and all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
see shes talking but im not entirely sure

chorus
do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it wont make it that much easier
it might make it worse

verse 2
oh a sudden disheartener
somebodys partners talking to me
but i dont know that is what she isnt
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how could she not she could have anyone she wants
and im struggling to think of an immediate response
like i dont mind itd be a big mistake for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really love its fine
i said really love its fine
you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3
and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh but she carried on suggesting a struggle to refuse
she said its the red wine this time but that is no excuse10embed"
