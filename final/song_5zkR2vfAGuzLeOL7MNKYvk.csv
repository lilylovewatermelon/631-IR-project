ive been thinking praying reading some magazines and its time we opened our eyes

sung
well the good lord made the universe
the lord created man
and i believe its all a part of his gigantic plan
i know god has a reason
for each mountain and each flower
and why he chose to let our boys get busy in the shower
they were not dirty—
they were not fruits
they were just two stray laces in the lords big boots
