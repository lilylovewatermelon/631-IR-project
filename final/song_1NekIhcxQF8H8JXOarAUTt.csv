oh oh‚ stick it down your throat
im watchin from the bathroom makin sure i dont
choke‚ choke from the words you spoke
when youre screamin at the mirror screamin at the mirror
now youre sittin in the cafeteria
shovin clementines and orange bacteria
down your throat a dozen times or near‚ yeah
fooling those around of your bulimia

chorus
you turn oranges to orange juice
enter there then spit it out of you
your body is imperfectly perfect
everyone wants what the other ones workin
no orange juice

verse 2
oh oh i believe you chose
to blow it on the reading carpet
thats what happens when you stuff it
please say that you wont continue
ordering oranges off the menu
stuffin up your mouth with tttissue
the way you look is not an issue
