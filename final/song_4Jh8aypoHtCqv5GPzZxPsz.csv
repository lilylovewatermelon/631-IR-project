if this is my last sh my last shit

and it would have to sound like a prince song

chorus
still a chainsmoking name dropping
good looking muhfucking motha shut your mouth
still a chainsmoking name dropping
good looking muhfuckin motha shut your mouth
brain broken frank ocean listening stain hitting
satin woodgrain gripping paint dripping motha shut your mouth

verse 1
somebody pray for the god oh lord
i wonder what michaels on
son jammin to his shit rappin trappin trippin cid
and sniffing glue and chewing vicodin
shoulda died yelling yolo was a lie
and you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
you and i look just alike
and im afraid that this one right here
might be last time that i write a song
lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
but i aint tryna go out at all
so i aint tryna go out at all
got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
last chance joint gotta be a dance joint
from an introspective drugged out standpoint
throw bands joint wanna hold hands joint
old school for my own old man joint
