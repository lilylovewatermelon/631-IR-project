patience
it took you for everything
it looked like a diamond ring
and you wore it so much longer that made sense
apathy in disguise crept on you like a spy
hurt you in ways you cant describe

prechorus
back to the start now
i wont let you go this way now

chorus
honesty is what you need
it sets you free
like someone to save you
let it go but hurry though
theres undertow
and i dont wanna lose you now

verse 2
alright sit down and spill your heart
lets start from the very start
cause i can see by your eyes youre wasted
your energy comes and goes
youve taken your time and know
nothing can change whats happened so

chorus
honesty is what you need
it sets you free
like someone to save you

now
oh my look at how your bright stars faded
so how much can you take

chorus
honesty is what you need
it sets you free
like someone to save you
let it go but hurry though
theres undertow
and i dont wanna lose you
