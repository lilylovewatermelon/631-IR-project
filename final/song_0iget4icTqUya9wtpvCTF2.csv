fuck you all all

verse 1 corey taylor
running out of ways to run
i cant see i cant be
over and over and under my skin
all this attention is doing me in

chorus corey taylor with chris fehn
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me

verse 2 corey taylor
picking through the parts exposed
taking shape taking shag
over and over and under my skin
all this momentum is doing me in

chorus corey taylor with chris fehn
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me

bridge corey taylor
you got all my love livin in your own hate
drippin hole man hard step no fate
show you nothin but i aint holdin back
every damn word i say is a sneak attack
when i get my hands on you
aint a fucking thing you can do
get this cause youre never gonna get me
i am the very disease you pretend to be
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move

chorus corey taylor with chris fehn
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit dont ever judge me
