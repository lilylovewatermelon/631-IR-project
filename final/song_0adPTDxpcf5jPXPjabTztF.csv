did it feel as long as mine
whether youre downtown and youre drinkin on washington
or laid down with a glass of wine
well i havent seen you in forever
dont you know its been a little while
now youre in your church pew pageant again
wearin that same old artificial smile

cause you always had your damn sunglasses on
to cover up your honest eyes
they were the one true thing
that revealed your pain
they exposed you from your lies
you got them beautiful eyes

you called me one night when youre drinkin
ridin round with so called friends
just go on and tell me how sorry i was
and how youve been happy ever since
but i saw you the very next day
well it was just by heavens chance
got a blue tear rollin down your face
i guess i caught you without that same pair of ray bans

cause you always had your damn sunglasses on
to cover up your honest eyes
they were the one true thing
that revealed your pain
they exposed you from your lies
you got them beautiful eyes
got them beautiful eyes
