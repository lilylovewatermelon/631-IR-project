we built sandcastles that washed away
i made you cry when i walked away oh
and although i promised that i couldnt stay baby
every promise dont work out that way oh babe
every promise dont work out that way

verse 2
dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
pictures snatched out the frame
bitch i scratched out your name and your face
what is it about you that i cant erase baby
when every promise dont work out that way no no babe
when every promise dont work out that way

verse 3
and your heart is broken cause i walked away
show me your scars and i wont walk away oh
and i know i promised that i couldnt stay baby
every promise dont work out that way no no no no no
every promise dont work out that wayyou might also like29embed"
