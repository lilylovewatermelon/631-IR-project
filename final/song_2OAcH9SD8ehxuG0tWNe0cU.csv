its doja
i dont know how else to tell you this but
i got one way maybe this will work
you just gotta listen closely to me
i need you me us
addicted uh

chorus
i am addicted a little
under the influence a little
and it makes me want to dance a little
an itch i just cant scratch addiction

verse 1
i got such a pretty body
feels prettier when im a mess
and i just like to call him daddy
cause the first one had up and left
and you can relate to broken girls
ive been a day without it im proud of myself
baby can you break the curse
im so gone i believe in magic
you can relate to broken girls
ive been a day without it im proud of myself
baby can you break the curse
im so gone i believe in magic

verse 2
yeah roll another hunnid
we could get the white girl lit like madonna
bitch i aint gwen but this shit is bananas
sweating make ya whole body drip like a sauna
swim like your piranha put ms in my water
i cant feel my lips my limbs feel like rubber
yeah i came down but i still need another
one under the tongue and then a little marijuana
they on the trees like koala
chorus
i am addicted a little
under the influence a little
and it makes me want to dance a little
an itch i just cant scratch addiction
