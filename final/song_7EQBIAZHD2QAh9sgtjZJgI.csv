we dont wanna have a conversation
we dont wanna think about it we just wanna fake it fake it
we just wanna act like everything is great
go back to the day watchin movies in the basement
and the problem is now im feeling like everything is changed
and im trying to make a livin on the music
but i feel like every time i look at you im in a place
its hard to be the man of the house when you aint got a house i hate this
yeah its complicated its complicated

we dont wanna talk we dont wanna talk

im sitting in the hotel room like why
