ive got a will this time i dont care what you say
ive got a feeling this will all go away
its in the wind this time its in the southern sky
i cant walk on water yet wont even try

chorus 1
drown me slowly enclose me
drown me slowly alright
drown me slowly enfold me
drown me slowly

verse 2
all that i took with me was a bad taste in my mouth
went all around the world just couldnt spit it out
just like ground zero was the surface of the sun
thats a sickness i cant fix it not all at once

chorus 1
drown me slowly enclose me
drown me slowly alright
drown me slowly enfold me
drown me slowly

chorus 2
dont let them take you down
youll leave a better world than you found
dont let them take you down
youll leave a better world than you found

dont let them take you down
dont let them take you down
dont let them take you down
