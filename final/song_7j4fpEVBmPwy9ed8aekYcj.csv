im on my way to amarillo i cant seem to get my fill of that
little west texas town
ive got a sweet thing built right betty head to toe shes mighty pretty
living in that west texas town

chorus
friday comes its time to roll time for me to hit the road
ive got my eyes on the horizon
my little dish in that panhandle lights up like a roman candle
when i reach that west texas town

ah sing it dean

verse 2
from big spring all the way to plainview i cant wait to get to you know who
in that west texas town
i drive through hell and half of texas just to get to her by breakfast
waiting in the west texas town

chorus
friday comes its time to roll time for me to hit the road
ive got my eyes on the horizon
my little dish in that panhandle lights up like a roman candle
when i reach that west texas town
