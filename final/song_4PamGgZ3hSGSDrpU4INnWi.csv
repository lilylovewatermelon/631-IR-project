ion displacement wont work in the basement
especially when im not with you
here in the heartland a feeling so startling
i dont know what i should do

chorus
oh bryn you see through the dark
right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
you know its easy to see
wait for the season to come back to me

verse 2
nights by the ocean a westerly motion
that moves california to sea
eyes like a seagull no kansasborn beetle
could ever come close to that free

chorus
oh bryn you see through the dark
right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
you know its easy to see
wait for the season to come back to mesee vampire weekend liveget tickets as low as 73you might also like5embed"
