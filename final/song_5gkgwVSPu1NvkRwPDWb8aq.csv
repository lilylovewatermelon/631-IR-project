tiny hands
yes thats you
and all you show
its simply true
i smell your breath
it makes me cry
i wonder how ive lived my life

chorus
cause without you
how did i get through all of my days without you
now living with you see everythings true
my baby its you
my baby my baby my baby

verse 2
with no words at all
so tiny and small
in love i fall so deep so deep
my precious love sent from above
my baby boo god i thank you
god i thank you

chorus
cause without you
how did i get through all of my days without you
now living with you see everythings true
my baby its you
my baby my baby my baby
cause without you
how did i get through all of my days without you
now living with you see everythings true
my baby its you
