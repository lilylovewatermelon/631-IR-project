verse 3 kanye west
i feel like its still niggas that owe me checks
i feel like its still bitches that owe me sex
i feel like this but niggas dont know hes stressed
i lost the only girl in the world that know me best
i got the money and the fame man that dont mean shit
i got the jesus on a chain man that dont mean shit
cause when the jesus pieces cant bring me peace
yo i need just at least ugh one of russells nieces
on i let my nightmares go
i put on everybody that i knew from the go
i know hoes that was fronting when they knew he was broke
they say damn yeezy yeezy you dont know us no more
you got that big fame homie and you just changed on me
you can ask big homie man the top so lonely
i aint lying
so lonely i aint lying
let me see what we have tonight what we have tonight
im high as a satellite satellite
