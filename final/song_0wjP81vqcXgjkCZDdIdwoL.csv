never quit until the clock stops
and never die out until your heart drops
success will separate you from the havenots
and have all these haters at your neck like an ascot
you could do it too young world
i remember being exactly like you young girl
but wait you could do it too young man
see youll be fine as long as on your own two you stand

hook
keep on living keep on breathing
even when you dont believe it
keep on climbing keep on reaching
even when this world cant see it
no impossible is nothing
even when you dont believe it
impossible is nothing
even when this world cant see it
impossible is nothing

verse 2
got to hate to not have it more than you love to obtain it
your futures around the corner so close you can almost taste it
it get worse before its better that storm you gone have to weather
either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure
25 hours 8 days out the week
focus keep eyes open victory never sleeps
my prayers for you is that you hit all them goals you trynna reach
i even hope at one point that you take it farther than me
you might also likehook
keep on living keep on breathing
even when you dont believe it
keep on climbing keep on reaching
even when this world cant see it
no impossible is nothing
even when you dont believe it
impossible is nothing
even when this world cant see it
impossible is nothing

bridge
i shall never let em see me sweat
promise to want for more until my very last breath
promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
and never sell out my soul for any number on a cheque
i shall never let em see me sweat
promise to want for more until my very last breath
promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
just promise me when im gone you wont forget

hook
keep on living keep on breathing
even when you dont believe it
keep on climbing keep on reaching
even when this world cant see it
no impossible is nothing
even when you dont believe it
impossible is nothing
even when this world cant see it
impossible is nothing29embed"
