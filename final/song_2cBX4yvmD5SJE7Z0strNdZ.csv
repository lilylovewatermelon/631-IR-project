my friends say theyre proud of me
for taking our breakup so casually
but they dont see what lies beneath my smile
it appears that im okay
and i moved on when you walked away
but the truth is since you said goodbye

chorus
im invisibly shaken and quietly breakin
desperately takin one breath at a time
beneath this composure i know its over
baby im dying cause you cant be mine
but i will never show the toll its taking
cause im invisibly shaken

verse 2
if it looks like i dont care
its not killing me seeing you here
and hearing you say you want to try us again
believe me it aint easy being this cool
but too many times girl ive been your fool
and i know id just end up here again

chorus

baby im dying cause you cant be mine
but i will never show the toll its taking
cause im invisibly shakenembed"
