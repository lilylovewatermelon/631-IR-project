verse 1 kendrick lamar
enoch your fathers just detoxed my callin is right on time
transformation i must had a thousand lives
and like three thousand wives
you should know that im slightly off
fightin off demons that been outside
better known as myself im a demigod
every thought is creative sometimes im afraid of my open mind

chorus kendrick lamar
shit on my mind and its heavy
tell you in pieces cause its way too heavy
my diamonds the choker is heavy
more lifе to give on demand are you rеady
who keep em honest like us
who in alignment like us
who gotta heal em all us us
when theres no one to call

bitch its a celebration
and if this shit aint bussin whats it for now

verse 2 kendrick lamar
uzi your fathers in deep meditation
my spirits awakened my brain is asleep
i got a new temperature
sharpenin multiple swords in the faith i believe
i think about robert kelly
if he werent molested i wonder if lifed fail him
i wonder if oprah found closure
the way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
my mother abused young
like all of the mothers back where we from
ssi bury family members
at the repass they servin popeyes chicken
what you know about black trauma
fns kickin back is another genre
tyler perry the face of a thousand rappers
using violence to cover what really happen
i know somebodys listenin
past life regressions to know my conditions
its based off experience
karma for karma my habits insensitive
watchin my cousin struggle with addiction
then watchin her firstborn make a million
and both of them off the grid for forgiveness
im sacrificin myself to start the healin and
chorus kendrick lamar
shit on my mind and its heavy

who keep em honest like us
who in alignment like us
who gotta heal em all us us
when theres no one to call us us
