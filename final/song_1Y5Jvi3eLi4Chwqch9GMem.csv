well we could be superstars
we been rather wreckin cars ayy bro is that jambo
what is at stakes for us
kickin off power mirrors
yeah we could be superstars
but im pretty sure our time is up
and so we fell off the spinning tops
dont know maybe for trial atl jacob atl jacob
but way more error huh

verse 1
say you my nigga ima be your killer
nobody gon play with you when im with you
go against any nigga like fuck this glitter
skeet off third im busy
i put it in for you i spinned for you
whatever you with im with it
how you gon cross a nigga that was rockin with you i got you lit in the city
i been multitaskin rappin and bein a daddy to my lil children
i been standin on business and spinnin and spinnin and spinnin until im dizzy
i do all the smackin you aint never stepped or helped with none of this killin
you doin lot of cappin watch whеn i catch you ima whack you in front the witness

chorus
damn my nigga you trippin

remember when we was jackin cars
now its not safe for you
you switched like a pussy lil bitch
damn my nigga you trippin

verse 2
