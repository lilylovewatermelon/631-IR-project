drum dummie
fresh up out a cell where that bag at
i was flying but now i need somewhere to land at
i took a loss but now im lookin where the chance at
but im a boss you need some help and i can hand that

chorus
i wish i was somewhere where it aint no violence
but ive been totin on that pole every time that i roll
tryna bust a nigga head if he try me
at night i need someone on side me just to hold me
but i was trying and im really tired of sayin that
im tired of thuggin now im tryna see where the love at

verse 1

verse 2
for my baby moms i dont wan be a problem
you feel that i aint there for my sons tell me and i got em
but you shouldnt have to tell me i need to put down this bottle
i pray to god that i aint taking after my papa
but free that nigga out his cell he need a second chance
and i can probably show him how to be a real man
he went to jail behind that money i aint know his plan
but no more he wont be a dummy ima throw him bands
but hold up i need to thank my grandfather
he showed me how to fix them cars now i can work that rod now
dont judge a nigga since i moved from with him it been hard slime
from these streets i aint get nothin but pain and some jail time
