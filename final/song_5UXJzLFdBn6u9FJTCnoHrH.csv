one two

verse 1
its been a couple months
thats just about enough time
for me to stop crying when i look at all the pictures
now i kinda smile i havent felt that in a while
its late i hear the doorbell ringin and its pourin
i open up that door see your brown eyes at the entrance
you just wanna talk and i cant turn away a wet dog

prechorus
but please dont ruin this for me
please dont make it harder than it already is
im trying to get over this

chorus
i wish that you would stay in my memories
but you show up today just to ruin things
i wanna put you in the past cause im traumatized
but youre not lettin me do that cause tonight
youre all drunk in my kitchen curled in the fetal position
too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when i say
i wish that you would stay in my memories
in my memories stay in my memories
you might also likeverse 2
now i cant say goodbye if you stay here the whole night
you see its hard to find an end to somethin
that you keep beginning over and over again
i promise that the ending always stays the same

prechorus
so theres no good reason in make believin
that we could ever exist again
i cant be your friend cant be your lover
cant be the reason we hold back each other from falling in love
with somebody other than me

chorus
i wish that you would stay in my memories
but you show up today just to ruin things
i wanna put you in the past cause im traumatized
but youre not lettin me do that cause tonight
youre all drunk in my kitchen curled in the fetal position
too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when i say
i wish that you would stay in my memories
in my memories stay in my memories

bridge
since you came
i guess ill let you stay
for as long as it takes
to grab your books and your coat
and that one good cologne
that you bought when we were fighting
cause its still on my clothes everything that i own
and it makes me feel like dying
i was barely just surviving
chorus
i wish that you would stay in my memories
but you show up today just to ruin things
i wanna put you in the past cause im traumatized
but youre not lettin me do that cause tonight
youre all drunk in my kitchen curled in the fetal position
too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when i say
i wish that you would stay in my memories
in my memories stay in my memories40embed"
