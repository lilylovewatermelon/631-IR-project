whiwhite boy so cold they call me now ho

starry night posted on the fuckin boat ho

refrain yung now
no limit to my uicidal thoughts
god i bet you fuckin chew through my own thoughts
smoke a blunt told her who am i to cough when you the one who at a loss for the motherfuckin words
throw her to the fuckin curb no loss

verse 2 yung now
bitch i be that fuckin boss
got frost on my shoulder but i had to wipe it off
cut my wrists just for the fucking gloss
duck a pig fuck a bitch how i floss
fuckboys in my way christ coming off the cross
see them motherfuckers pause not knowing it depends on a fucking coin toss
either way i fucking lost

verse 3 lick loth
licklickitylick keep the flame on the bic
bitches run mouth when they all full of dick
roaches on me as i walk through the pit

tiptoeinghells ridge like i dont have no caution
kidnap your ho put that bitch in an auction
click clack oh no now yall laying in coffins
get back fuckboy cause my homicides often
murderous genocide conquerin just to divide
coincide with my fucked up mind

grey tides we ride
hear the battle cries for the most high
