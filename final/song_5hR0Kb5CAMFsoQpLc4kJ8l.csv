theres something bout a red dirt road that makes the sky more blue
something bout the concrete scrapes the roots right off of you

something bout them city limits feels more like a fence yeah

shake all the dust out of my head

toss some empties in the bed
out wherе nobody knows
you can find me where you cant

turn down the road i know to take thats gonna save my soul
crank up and gas it til theres static on the radio
