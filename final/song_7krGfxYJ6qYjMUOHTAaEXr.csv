well i wandered around after our war of words
and ive waited in vain here for weeks
the ghost of a girlfriend thats here in my room
i still smell her perfume in my sheets
but thats not her in my bed no shes out on the town
and i dont anyone to see
theres a tattoo of my name on her body but obviously
the man holding her hand isnt me
oh honey how could you regret me when you cant even forget me babe

hook
its okayyy to say that you love meeee
cause i think of you all night long still think of you all night long
ohh its okayyy to say that you love meeee
i think of you all night long still thinkin of you all night long

ceelo green
i thought that once youve had one youve had every woman
until i lost this legendary woman
shit now im sure
that they dont make em like her any more
so please baby please lover
lets find a way to forgive each other
ive gotten around ever since youve been gone
but without you im still alone
ohh how can you regret me when you know you cant forget me and
