every friend has got a friend in mind
because ive had more than a little time
so its on your mark get ready set
but i know my hearts not ready yet

chorus
i can walk into a room without you
and i dont get drunk and talk about you
so i guess ive learned to live without you
i just dont know how to love without you

verse 2
she dont have to look just like you
no her eyes dont have to be that blue
its hard to give someone a chance
when you cant get past that second dance

chorus
i can walk into a room without you
and i dont get drunk and talk about you
so i guess ive learned to live without you
i just dont know how to love without you

bridge
sometimes the pain is dulled to numb
and i cant believe how far ive come

i can walk into a room without you
i can breathe without you
and i i dont get drunk and talk about you no more no more
and i can sleep without you
so i i guess ive learned to live without you
i can be without i can be without you
i just dont know how to love without you
i dont know how i dont know how
see see i i had to learn to live without you
i had to learn to live without you
oh but i just dont know how to how to love how to love without you
oh i just dont know how to love how to love without you

outro
every friend has got a friend in mind
because ive had more than a little timeembed"
