its just an old beat up truck
some say that i should trade up
now that i got some jangle in my pocket
but what they don’t understand
is its the miles that make a man
i wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
what they don’t know is my dad and me–
we drove her out to tennessee
and she’s still here and now he’s gone
so i hold on

verse 2
its just an old beat up box
its rusty strings across the top
it probably don’t look like much to you
but these dents and scratches in the wood
yeah that’s what makes it sound so good
to me its better than brand new
you see this here flat top guitar
has had my back in a million bars
singing every country song
so i hold on

chorus
to the things i believe in
my faith your love our freedom
to the things i can count on
to keep me going strong
yeah i hold on i hold on
like the stripes to the flag
like a boy to his dad
i cant change who i am right or wrong
so i hold on

yeah baby looking at you right now
there aint never been no doubt
without you id be nothing
so if you ever worry about
me walking out
yeah let me tell you something
i hold on
i hold on
can you hear me baby
i hold on
yeah
i hold on…

chorus
to the things i believe in
my faith your love our freedom
to the things i can count on
to keep me going strong
to the things i believe in
my faith your love our freedom
to the things i can count on
to keep me going strong
yeah i hold on i hold on
i hold on and on and on and on and on
i hold on and on and on and on and on6embed"
