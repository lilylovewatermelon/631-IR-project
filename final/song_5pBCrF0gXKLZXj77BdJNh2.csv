stand on up and take a bow
theres something there and its showing
theres no need to look around
youre the best we got going

shout out to the dreams youll chase
shout out to the hearts youll break
nothings gonna stop you now
i guess youd better be going

prechorus
youll never be far im keeping you near
inside of my heart youre here
go on
its gotta be time
youre starting to shine
cause what youve got is

chorus
