sloan lets sing a song what should we sing

verse 1
my memory is not like the other one
turn to strike my face
always second place
tell me again why is it i
never can do anything right
complicated theories of life sarcastically

chorus
but we both know
the way its gonna go
in the same way
maybe im not all that you thought
and we dont move
like we used to do
in the same way
maybe youre not such a hot rod

verse 2
take back again all that i ever was
it was only just a phase
i never thought of it that way
but what do i know
im sorry for
not wanting to be your d√©cor
truth is such a violent force pushing you away
you might also likechorus
but we both know
the way its gonna go
in the same way
maybe im not all that you thought
and we dont move
like we used to do
in the same way
maybe youre not such a hot rod

chorus
but we both know
the way its gonna go
in the same way
maybe im not all that you thought
and we dont move
like we used to do
in the same way
maybe youre not such a hot rod13embed"
