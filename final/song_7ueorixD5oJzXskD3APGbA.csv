so scared of breaking it that you wont let it bend
and i wrote two hundred letters i will never send
sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
youd rather cover up id rather let them bleed
so let me be and ill set you free oh yeah

why wont you answer me
the silence is slowly killing me oh

verse 2 adam levine
your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
the way it feels to be completely intertwined
not that i didnt care its that i didnt know
its not what i didnt feel its what i didnt show
so let me be and ill set you free
