untouchable like a distant diamond sky
im reaching out and i just cant tell you why
im caught up in you im caught up in you

prechorus
untouchable burning brighter than the sun
and when youre close i feel like coming undone

chorus
in the middle of the night when im in this dream
its like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on come on say that well be together
come on come on little taste of heaven

verse 2
its half full and i wont wait here all day
i know youre saying that youd be here anyway

prechorus
but youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
and now that youre close i feel like coming undone

chorus
in the middle of the night when im in this dream
its like a million little stars spelling out your name
you got to come on come on say that well be together
come on come on oh
in the middle of the night waking from this dream
i want to feel you by my side standing next to me
you got to come on come on say that well be together
come on come on little taste of heaven
