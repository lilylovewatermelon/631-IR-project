bridge
its the same game today as it always is
i dont give these places fake my name explaining this
and the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
that remind me of all the times
i have committed dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly formfitted
to what ive done and what im doing
im brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
and believe me thats what all the kids are doing
what kids are doing theyre killing themselves
they feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
and if youre one of them then youre one of me
and you would do almost anything just to feel free
yeah am i right of course i am convince me otherwise would take all night
before you walk away theres one more thing i want to say
our brains are sick but thats okay

chorus
ill fake you out
ill fake you out
ill fake you out ill break you down
ill fake you out
and ill fall ill fake you out
and ill break ill fake you out
and ill fake ill fake you out
all i wanna all i wanna
ill fake you out
ill fake you out
ill fake you out ill break you down
ill fake you out

ill fake you out
ill break you down

and ill fake you out all i wanna
