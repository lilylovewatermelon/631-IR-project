moment of honesty
someones gotta take the lead tonight
whos it gonna be
im gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
if you have somethin to say you should say it right now
you should say it right now

prechorus
you give me a feeling that i never felt before
and i deserve it i think i deserve it
its becoming something thats impossible to ignore
and i cant take it

chorus
i was wonderin maybe could i make you my baby
if we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
if you ask me im ready im ready
if you ask me im ready im ready

verse 2
i know you said to me
this is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
if we gon do somethin bout it we should do it right now
we should do it right now
