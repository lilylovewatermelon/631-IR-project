thats right
one two three
one two
one one

verse 1
we sent out the sos call
it was a quarter past four in the morning
when the storm broke our second anchor line
four months at sea
four months of calm seas
to be pounded in the shallows off the tip of montauk point
they call em rogues they travel fast and alone
one hundred foot faces of gods good ocean gone wrong
what they call love is a risk
cause you will always get hit
out of nowhere by some wave
and end up on your own

chorus 1
the hole in the hull defied the crewâ€™s attempts
to bail us out
and flooded the engines and radio
and halfburied bow
you might also likeverse 2
your tongue is a rudder
it steers the whole ship
sends your words past your lips
keeps them safe behind your teeth
but the wrong words will strand you
come off course while you sleep
sweep your boat out to sea
or dashed to bits on the reef
the vessel groans
the ocean pressures its frame
to the port i see the lighthouse
through the sleet and the rain
and i wish for one more day to give my
love and repay debts
but the morning finds our bodies washed up 30 miles west

chorus 2
they say that the captain stays fast with the ship
through still and storm
but this aint the dakota
and the waters cold so cold
wont have to fight for long

outro
this is the end
this storys old but it goes on and on
until we disappear this is the calm
calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
while you were underneath we are the risen
i am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
sunk below the sea after the storm
i spoke the words but never gave a thought
to what they all could mean
rest in the deep
i know that this is what you want
a funeral keeps both of us apart washed up on the beach
you know that you are not alone
i need you like water in my lungs this is the end
this storys old but it goes on and on
until we disappear this is the calm
calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
while you were underneath we are the risen
i am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
sunk below the sea after the storm
i spoke the words but never gave a thought
to what they all could mean rest in the deep
i know that this is what you want
a funeral keeps both of us apart washed up on the beach
you know that you are not alone
i need you like water in my lungs
this is the end
