and into the sea
goes pretty england and me
around the bay of biscay
and back for tea
hit traffic on the dogger bank
up the thames to find a taxi rank
sail on by with the tide
and go to sleep
and the radio says

chorus
this is a low
but it wont hurt you
when youre alone
it will be there with you
findin ways to stay solo

verse 2
up the tyne forth and cromarty
theres a low in the high forties
saturdays locked away on the pier
not fast enough dear
and on the malin head
blackpool looks blue and red
and the queen shes gone round the bend
jumped off lands end
and the radio says
see blur liveget tickets as low as 995you might also likechorus
