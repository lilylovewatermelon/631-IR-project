the bar was empty
i was sweepin up the floor
thats when she walked in
i said im sorry but were closed
and she said i know
but im afraid i left my purse
i said i put one back behind the bar
i bet its probably yours

prechorus
and the next thing that i knew
there we were lost in conversation
before i handed her her purse
i said youll only get this back on one condition

chorus
and we danced
out there on that empty hardwood floor
the chairs up and the lights turned way down low
the music played we held each other close
and we danced

verse 2
and from that moment
there was never any doubt
i had found the one
that i had always dreamed about
and then one evenin
when she stopped by after work
i pulled a diamond ring
out of the pocket of my shirt
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeprechorus
and as her eyes filled up with tears
she said this is the last thing i expected
and then she took me by the hand
and said ill only marry you on one condition

chorus
and we danced
out there on that empty hardwood floor
the chairs up and the lights turned way down low
the music played we held each other close
and we danced
like no one else had ever danced before
i cant explain what happened on that floor
but the music played we held each other close
and we danced
yeah we danced2embed"
