hang out my window and over your head
stare at your feelings to see where they end
youre waiting here for someone else to break you from the inside
youve been so composed we all know

chorus
theres always somethin tearin you apart
its always so much longer than you counted on
and it hits you so much harder than you thought
but you dont worry you dont worry
cause youve got soul

verse 2
youre so heavy youre so misunderstood
and i spent all my wishes wishing times were good when i still could
wait around here for someone else to take me past the good side
youve been here so long now we all know

chorus
theres always somethin tearin you apart
its always so much longer than you counted on
and it hits you so much harder than you thought
but you dont worry you dont worry
cause darlin youve got so much soul
darlin youve got so much soul

well theres always somethin tearin you apart
its always so much longer than you counted on
and it hits you so much harder than you thought
than you ever thought it would
but you dont worry and you dont worry
cause you dont worry you dont worry
cause you dont worry you dont worry
cause youve got soulembed"
