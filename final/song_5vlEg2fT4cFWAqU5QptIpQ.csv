verse 1
remember the first time we met
you was at the mall with your friend
i was scared to approach ya but then you came closer
hoping you would give me a chance
who would have ever knew
that we would ever be more than friends
were real worldwide breaking all the rules
she like a song played again and again

that girl is a dime they say
that girl is a gun to my holster
and shes running through my mind all day ayy
