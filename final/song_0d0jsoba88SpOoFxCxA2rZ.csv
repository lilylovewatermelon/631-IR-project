me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota
a quarter tank of gas one pistol an orange soda
janky stash box when the federalesll roll up
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor
we on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
i hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringin sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
if its necessary bumpin jeezy first album lookin distracted
speakin language only we know you think its an accent
the windows roll down all i see is a hand pass it
hotboxin like george foreman grillin the masses
of the workin world we pulled up on a bunch of workin girls
and asked them what they workin with
look at me i got the blunt in my mouth
usually im drugfree but shit im with the homies
chorus 1
yeah nigga we off a pill and rémy red
come through and bust ya head nigga
me and the homies
sag all the way to the liquor store
where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
me and the homies
i ride for my mothafuckin niggas
hop out do my stuff then hop back in
me and the homies
matter of fact i hop out that mothafucka
and be like doodoodoodoot doodoodoodoodoot”
verse 2
its 230 and the sun is beamin
air conditioner broke and i hear my stomach screamin
hungry for anything unhealthy
and if nutrition can help me
ill tell you to suck my dick then ill continue eatin
we speedin on the 405 passin westchester
you know the lightskinned girls in all the little dresses
good lord they knew we werent from round there
cause every time we down there
we pullin out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
before we sparked a conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didnt like
then started interrogatin
i never was a gangbanger i mean
i never was stranger to the fonk neither i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
thats ironic cause ive never been violent
until im with the homies

chorus 2
just ridin just ridin
me and the homies
bullshittin actin a fool
me and the homies
trippin really trippin
me and the homies
just ridin just ridin just ridin
verse 3
braggin bout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessy didnt make me feel that bad
im usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up even if we aint got the cd in
but jeezy still playin
and our attitude is still nigga what is you sayin
pull in front of the house
that we been campin out for like two months
the sun is goin down as we take whatever we want

break
ayy ayy nigga jackpot nigga pop the safe
ayy nigga i think theres somebody in this room
wait what
nigga theres somebody in this room

verse 4
i hit the back window in search of any nintendo
dvds plasmascreen tvs in the trunk
we made a right then made a left then made a right
then made a left we was just circlin life
my mama called hello what you doin — kickin it
i shoulda told her im probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies
police sirens
but – they made a right then made a left
then made a right then another right
one lucky night with the homies

outro

yeah we finally got that nigga faded
i think he hit the wrong blunt though
ooh which one
well which one he talkin about
i was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
i pray he aint hit that

got the shenanigans give that nigga the shenanigans
nigga i think we should push back to the city fo real doe
nigga for what
