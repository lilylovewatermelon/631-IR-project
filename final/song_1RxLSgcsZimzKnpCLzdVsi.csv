verse 1
she works at hot topic
his heart microscopic
she thinks that its love
but to him its sex
he listens to emo
but fat mikes his hero
his bank accounts zero
what comes next

prechorus
same song different chorus

its stupid contagious
to be broke and famous

from punk rock 101

my spiked hair your new vans
lets throw up our rock hands
for punk rock 101
