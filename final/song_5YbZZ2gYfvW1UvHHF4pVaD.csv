im five years old its getting cold ive got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

chorus
i dont know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know youre not scared of anything at all
dont know if snow whites house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today

verse 2
im thirteen now
and dont know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop til ive forgotten all their names

chorus
i dont know who im going to talk to now at school
but i know im laughing on the car ride home with you
dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today

i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother inside and out
hes better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you

verse 3
there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddys smart
and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

chorus
and now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didnt know if you knew so im taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today17embed"
