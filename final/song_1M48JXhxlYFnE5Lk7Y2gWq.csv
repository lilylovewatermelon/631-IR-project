eyes make their peace in difficulties
with wounded lips and salted cheeks
and finally we step to leave
to the departure lounge of disbelief

prechorus
and i dont know where im going
but i know its gonna be a long time
and ill be leaving in the morning
come the white wine bitter sunlight

chorus
wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time before daylight

verse 2
in the canyon underneath the trees
behind the dark sky you looked at me
i fell for you like autumn leaves
never faded evergreen

prechorus
and i dont know where im going
but i know its gonna be a long time
cause ill be leaving in the morning
come the white wine bitter sunlight

wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time

i cant face this now everything has changed
i just wanna be by your side
heres hoping we collide
heres hoping we collide
heres hoping we collide

chorus
wanna hear your beating heart tonight
before the bleeding sun comes alive
i want to make the best of what is left hold tight
and hear my beating heart one last time
