she wants to get married she wants it perfect
she wants her granddaddy preachin the service
and she wants magnolias out in the country
not too many people save her daddy some money

prechorus 
ooh she got it all planned out
yeah i can see it all right now

chorus
ill wear my black suit black tie hide out in the back
ill do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
ill try to make it through without cryin so nobody sees
yeah she wanna get married
but she dont wanna marry me

verse 2
