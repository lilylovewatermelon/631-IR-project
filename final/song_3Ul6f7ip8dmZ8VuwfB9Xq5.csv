girl never lie to me
ayy girl never lie to me
duck from the flashin lights watch out when the tide comin
all these people judgin
take a sip out the double cup cant tell me nothin
i know its all for the better and im never stuntin
i just want a girl who gon really tell me somethin ayy

chorus
ayy girl never lie to me
girl would you ride for me pull up on the side for me
duck from the flashin lights and watch out when the tide comin
i know its hard to be yourself when all these people judgin
take a sip out the double cup cant tell me nothin
i know its all for the better and im never stuntin
i just want a girl who gon really show me somethin
give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin

verse 1
rollin cookie in la i think i found my bae
she roll my weed so she gonna be hard to replace
we takin shots of that henny i dont need a chase
almost forgot where im at can barely feel my face
rockstar lifestyle might just die tonight
if i was down and had nobody would you sacrifice
they said loose ends break friends i aint tryna fight
fuck bein sober girl come over and enjoy the high
so dont fuck up the vibe dont ever waste my time
and when im feelin down will you come stay the night
and if you far away then will you book a flight
my neck flooded with ice she grip it like a vice
cant ever play it nice the world so full of lies
and im not bein them cause im just not that guy
you wanna be somebody so put aside your pride
so open up your eyes they talkin from outside

ayy girl never lie to me
girl would you ride for me pull up on the side for me
duck from the flashin lights and watch out when the tide comin
i know its hard to be yourself when all these people judgin
i take a sip out the double cup cant tell me nothin
i know its all for the better and im never stuntin
i just want a girl who gon really show me somethin
give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin

verse 2
give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin
i know they hatin on me cause i really came from nothin
i just wanna talk to you can we have discussion
why you frontin on me shawty better stop the bluffin
you better stop the bluffin i really know you want it
you push that thing up on me so ima jump up on it
i aint gonna fake it because i know i want it
these niggas so 50 i keep my shit a hundred
roll this wood and we gettin high
she say she love me i know thats a lie
and you know we up in the sky
roll this wood and we gettin high
she say she love me i know thats a lie
and you know we up in the sky40embed"
