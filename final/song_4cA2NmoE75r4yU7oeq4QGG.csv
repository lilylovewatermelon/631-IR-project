it takes a hell of a heart to know what a heart really needs
and im finding out that love aint what loves cut out to be
if i was not my mommas boy id leave you cryin in this car
punch a hole in your damn dashboard and forget the girl you are

verse 2
weve been fighting for so long itd be a shame to let this go
but id rather let it lie than hurt a sweet girl i know
and its getting dark now so wont you just stay
and ill tell you that i love you til the leaving goes away

chorus
til the leaving leaves this house no we aint going out
til i make some promises that i cant keep
and i wish i could explain how the toxins in my brain
get me so damn down sometimes i cant speak
and youll try to understand why i cant be a better man
but its hard when im yelling at you in the street
so if leaving comes to staying and you walk yourself away
leave knowing that no one could love you more than me

bridge
and i hope the world dont mind all the simple things i ask
like a porch with good lighting and to hear my lady laugh
and ill act indifferent because i dont wanna leave
cause leavings for a younger man that i dont wanna be
