white moon white moon breaks open the tune
of a deserted cartoon that i wrote
creature come creature creature my own doublefeature
as im warmin the bleachers at home

chorus 1
well my nose keeps on bleeding cause its rita im needing
i better call out a meeting of the boys
of the boys

verse 2
my friends are all dying and death cant be lying
its the truth and it dont make a noise
oh rita oh rita if you lived in reseda
i would move you with the beat of a drum
and this picture is proof that although youre aloof
you had the shiniest tooth neath the sun

chorus 2
easy come easy go be a star of the show
im giving up all i know to get more
to get more

verse 3
photograph the picture young grunt pinup scripture
for the lockertagged memories of war
a mirage this garage and the photo montage
and the finger massage from the host

good lord good lord the one i adored
that i cannot afford is a ghost
is a ghost

chorus 4
protosocial is the word and the word is the bird
that flew through the herd in the snow
in the snow

verse 4
lemonade me then grade me then deliver my baby
and if my friends all persuade me ill go
blink blink at me rita dont you know im a bleeder
and i promised i wouldnt lead her on

outro
but she read me then led me and i ate what was fed me
til i purged every word in this song2embed"
