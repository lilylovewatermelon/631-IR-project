most recent update 101307

i’m sure every hiphopper has heard about the beef that has gone one between the two well known emcees canibus and eminem on one side you have canibus the emcee who for the most part stays one dimensional and gives us mostly battle raps already known for his publicized beef with ll cool j and his less publicized beefs with beanie sigel and truck turner bis can be vicious as he wants to in battle on the other side you have eminem the popular emcee who is known most for his ill lyrics and shock tactics aside from ll em is probably the most battle tested emcee of all time but while em was already familiar with lyrical beefs bis was his first real competition and the first rapper who you could honestly match him line for line i mean come on can you call ja rule everlast benzino or the insane clown posse lyrical competition for em many believe it just started when em called him canibitch’ on his 2002 album the eminem show but thats not true not to many people know that the beef has been boiling since before em was even signed i’ll be the first to admit that many of the disses here are pure speculation but there are some that are straight out obvious let me fill you in on what has been described as ‘the most theatrical emcee battle of all time’

in 2002 em spoke on how the beef with canibus started on tim westwood’s hiphop radio show in the united kingdom all while him and proof of d12 called bis names like ‘canibitch’ and ‘canishit’ while the audio itself is extremely hard to find on its own someone was cool enough to upload the interview to youtube so you can hear it here

according to em the beef started in 1998 before em was even signed of course a different beef was heating up at that time bis and ll cool j ll had just released “the ripper strikes back” a response to bis’ “second round ko” the diss track as a whole was decent though l relied on using stuff bis said in his track to go back at him and not doing anything original in fact the best original disses were aimed not at bis but at mike tyson who appeared with bis on the track canibus’ manager at the time wyclef jean told bis that he heard eminem ghostwrote the lyrics to the track with that bis and wyclef invited em to the video shoot of the canibus song “i honor u” so they could talk to him about it directly wyclef asked him first and em denied the claims that he wrote it later bis asked em again separately em’s reply to him was that “yo i’m a grown man i would tell you if i wrote it or not” em then said he wanted to do something with bis like a collaboration or something bis’ response was “yo dogg get to know me first” with bis basically acting rude towards him

it must be noted that em apparently had much love for bis before the situation at the video shoot it was reported em gave bis a lot of props in an interview and upon further investigation i found an online internet chat dated 51498 where em gives bis props the link to the whole review is here httpwebarchiveoeweminemhtm

mainframec eminemwho do you think right now is the best battle emcee you faced besides juice

eminem mainframec first of all i give juice the maddest love i havent faced the bestbut to me canibus is the best i love him but some people who i think is ill thirstin howl wordsworth aristotle royce the 5 nine he is on my album jive t and the list goes on

and later which someone else brings bis up again em continues to show love

nitroneox eminem why do u think canibus is so ill

eminem nitroneox cause i mean str8 up he is more than a battle mc if you heard the track on bulworth called how comeand his delivery to me is illjust listen to him if you dont like him then you shouldnt be listening to rap he is the mc at the moment
however after this whole situation went down as well as bis debut coming out and receiving lessthanstellar reviews ems opinion obviously seemed to change and thats when the dissig started

em started taking shots at bis in two of his tracks the first was on his major label debut “the slim shady lp” on the song “role model” “im cancerous so when i diss you wouldnt wanna answer this  if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus  i’ll strangle you to death then i’ll choke you again  then break your fuckin’ legs till your bones poke through your skin  you beef wit me imma even the score equally  take you on jerry springer and beat your ass legally” i know you could say that could’ve been taken either way but i believe it was a diss referencing the ghostwriting incident in a peculiar way it should also be noted that role model was later released as a radio single and just like the previous singles released from the album my name is and guilty conscience some of the raunchier and more explicit lines were changed the lines directly following the battle rap for canibus lines were changed for the mention of killing but these new lines made another reference to canibus this time talking about ll and stealing the mic off his arm referencing bis original changed lines from 4321 which is how the beef between l and bis started the censored radio version of role model goes like this “im cancerous so when i diss you wouldnt wanna answer this  if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus  a hellspawn dropping a stealth bomb  six mics in the source they borrowed one from lls arm”

the second track was “get you mad” from the sway and tech “this or that” mix the first two lines don’t diss bis but refer to his beef with ll in the same matter that the edited lines from role model did “my attitude is worse than nwas was ill battle you over stupid shit  and diss people who don’t have shit to do with it like cool j does my tattoo but the real diss towards bis was later on when em talked about his ‘plan for emcees to get record deals’ “lesson three get a job at a label  switch demos with canibus and put yours on the owners table here listen” i believe that diss was a shot at bis’ material saying that if you switch your demo with canibus youll surprise the label heads because canibus shit isn’t impressive

also em apparently slammed bis in an interview after his slim shady lp was released he was asked this question if you could take back anything you said what would it be em replied that canibus is dope cause he isnt

ok now back to em’s explanation of the beef from the westwood show according to em canibus came to see him on the warped tour the following year and apologized for his reactions and asked if eminem was still up for doing collaboration em said yes and so the track was going to be made for bis’ second album 2000 bc bis presented em with the track “phuk u” with only bis’ first two verses on there and the third verse for em to fill in unfortunately em said he wasn’t feeling the track and turned it down when the track came out em said the third verse sounded like it was directed toward him or ll but he couldnt really tell however in an interview with allhiphopcom in 2001 done right after c true hollywood stories came out bis was asked if he directed the verse at em

now with the subtle disses to em on this cd did you have a verse dissing eminem on the song fyou off your last album

you know i’ve heard people talking about that but i wouldn’t say that it was about eminem everytime people hear me rhyme they analyze my lyrics to death but as far as eminem let me say this i got a mutual respect for eminem because between his rhyming content and delivery i think hes tight and that goes with out saying hes got the total package and has proven himself in the arena of selling records so for the record i do wanna say that he is tight without a shadow of a doubt if you ask em about me he will say the same thing about me as far as our careers its just that he ran off with dre when he got in the game and i ran off with clef you know if the tables were turned then maybe things would have been different also

is the verse directed at em or not you be the judge

aiyyo your superstar status dont mean shit to me
lyrically sucker emcees still get fricasseed
try to diss me now how you sound
yo whoever signed you must be runnin the circus cuz you a clown
you a rapper wit a drug habit hidin the truth
camouflagin ya needle tracks wit some colorful tattoos
you was never equipped for this never equipped to spit wit bis
im swift as shit let me point out the main differences
you magnificent im ‘micnificent’
yo i’d even go out on a limb wit it say you write a little bit
that dont make you a tight lyricist cause you dont practice or stick with it
look at the 60 hour shifts i spend wit this
i never quit i got a gift for the art
a lowmaintenance cost no physical moving parts
in 98 niggas thought i was god how the fuck did that change
im still one of the illest niggas in the game
so look inside yourself and tell me what you see
if you see a hungry nigga then you looking at me
and it’s alright if you don’t trust me cause i don’t trust you
as a matter of fact id probably bust you motherfucker fuck you
 canibus third verse of “phuk u”
2000 bc leaked a few months before it was released in july so em had heard it i’m guessing in may right before his 2nd major album “the marshall mathers lp” was released after this the freestyle disses started coming on the radio and live shows eminem and proof went on tim westwood’s show in 2000 taking an outright shot at canibus in a freestyle bis never really dissed em before then but he did say a few things that could’ve been aimed at em the first of these lines were used in a 100 bar freestyle at hot 97’s radio station on the day before his album was released perhaps making a reference that em was wack because he was not black another line from that freestyle couldve been a reference to ems lines from the westwood freestyle listed below saying bis can freestyle another one of these supposed jabs by bis towards em was at a live show in england shortly after performing what would become the next ll diss track “rip the jacker” he kept freestyling and said a line that could have been aimed at em saying his stuff at the rap olympics where competed and lost in the final round was wack

“plus i provoke you and then i bust
freestyles y’all can’t trust i’m like canibus
i bust can i bus no you can’t
but yes i can cause i’m slim shady and i’m the man”
 eminem freestyling over 4 3 2 1” on the tim westwood radio show in 2000

“aiyyo we flex styles like a bisec’
i found out where canibus’ money went i borrowed a dollar from wyclef”
 proof freestyling over 4 3 2 1” on the tim westwood radio show in 2000 immediately following em’s lines listed above

“thought i couldnt freestyle you must be freebasing

listen it’s not like i’m wack it’s not like i can’t rap
it’s not like i’m not black so cop that”
 canibus release day freestyle on dj clue’s show on july 17th the day before 2000 bc came out

“and i’m tired of all these wack niggas and wack wiggers
with wack lyrics bring that shit to the rap olympics”
 canibus freestyling live in london in december in 2000

things stayed quiet for a while eminem’s career skyrocketed while canibus’ career went sadly downwards bis became a very depressed individual and released his third album “c true hollywood stories” in 2001 in an attempt to sacrifice himself and leave the game forever the most well known track on the album was “u didn’t care” where bis continued the story of “stan” the eminem track from the mmlp he spoke as stan for the entire track it was a creative amusing conceptual song that proclaimed canibus dedication to his fans saying he’s different from the mainstream artists who could care less about them it’s viewed as an eminem diss song but he didn’t diss him much until the last verse he spoke on the ghostwriting incident and then took a few actual shots at em by reminding him still as stan that he too was once the fan and that we all have idols

“matter of fact i think he bis met you
it was the day you came to his video shoot with dj jimmys nephew 
clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
that you was ghostwriting for l but that wasnt true
you was lookin’ at him the same way im lookin’ at you
why cant we be friends em i dont want nothin’ from you
you see theres a little bit of stan in all of us
tell me where you think all of these record sales spawned from
talkin’ bout britney and christina aguilera
nsync too have you ever looked in a mirror
your hair aint really blonde and ya eyes aint blue
so never diss me cuz when you diss me you’re dissin’ you
 canibus from “u didn’t care”

in 2002 em decided he wouldn’t let bis get away with dissing him on his album “the eminem show” he took various shots at the canibus man the first of these tracks were “square dance” everyone thought this track was a diss towards nelly since em used the southern drawl nelly used in “hot in herre” but that wasn’t the case here em refers to him as canibitch in the first verse canibitch dont want no beef with slim  no not even on my radar  so wont you please jump off my dick lay off and stay off and the outro canibitch wont square dance with me  fanibitch wont square dance with me  canadabis dont want no parts of me but most of the disses are subliminal the lines on your knees got you under siege  somebody you would give a lung to be  hungary like a fuckin younger me  fuck the fee i can get you jumped for free are a rebuttal to the track phuk u he’s referring to is look inside yourself lines and the lines yeah buddy laugh its funny i have the money  to have you killed by somebody who has nothing are a rebuttal to the line from the jayz diss from cths i got a story to tell i had nothing before and i have nothing now  fuckin with a nigga with nothing only brings you down the other subliminal diss is one line referencing bis song draft me where bis talked about defending his country which then leads him into some introspective lyrics about getting drafted for the army even if you’re too young “yeah you laugh till your motherfucking as gets drafted”

he also went out of his way to diss bis a few times in “say what you say” for the most part the track is a diss to jermaine dupri who had put himself above dre as the best producer in the game in an interview this first part is one i missed at first but it is indeed directed at bis “first take i make mistakes just keep it  no punches pulled no punches that’s weak shit  fake shit if i ever take shit i’ll eat shit  wasn’t for him wouldn’t be shit” the line that proved to me that it was a diss towards bis was the ‘no punches’ line em would mention bis’ punchlines in a later diss mentioned later in this review practically begging for bis to use punchlines in his disses towards em i looked at it like “no punches that’s weak shit” meaning that if bis wasn’t using punchlines to diss em it would be only looked at as weak the line that confused me was the last one “wasn’t for him wouldn’t be shit” that could be taken one of three ways as a reference to himself saying he wouldn’t be anything without dre a producing pioneer in hiphop backing him with his dope production a reference to jd saying that jd wouldn’t even be producing if it wasn’t for dre’s influence or it could’ve been a reference to canibus saying that if it wasn’t for his beef with ll cool j he would still be just another noname underground rapper you can take that however you want but em did go on to mention bis in the track by name later on second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this  amateurs drink veteran piss  from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up  or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri  we’ll rub it in every club you’re in  we’ll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap afuckin’gain”

but perhaps his best diss towards bis from the eminem show album was his verse in the song “when the music stops” he constantly refers to his bis’ known dj clue freestyle the one that begins with i speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearing  canibus is the lyrical version of german engineering when you finish the verse you realize it is a satire of bis’ freestyle if you dont understand let me explain with the line if there aint shit for me to feed off im seesaw battling” he’s calling out his battle with bis saying if they aren’t working together then they are battling in the lines “but theres way too much at stake for me to be fake  theres too much on my plate  i done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away  and not say what i got to say” he notes how bis called him a stan in “u didn’t care” and says he has struggled too much to get to the top of the rap game just to act fake or let canibus get away with dissing him the lines “what the fuck you take me for a joke you smoking crack” and “ill get up fore i get down run myself in the ground  ‘fore i put some wack shit out” are a reference to the cths album as a whole saying bis must be smoking crack for taking him as a joke and that he’d kill himself before he’d put out a wack album like it he goes after bis with a few challenges first a physical one like he did to everlast and icp then challenges him to freestyle the first reference to bis’ freestyle i mentioned fuck shooting im just trying to knock his teeth out  fuck with me now bich let’s see you freestyle” em then makes a clear reference to canibus freestyle with the line “motherfucker if you really feeling froggish leap” this cements the verse as a satire of canibus dj clue freestyle as in that old verse bis used the line “you feel like a frog nigga then jump” he then says that cths was an attempt to diss him and he won’t let him get away with it “yo slim you gonna let him get away with that he tried to play you you cant let him escape with that” and then ends his verse saying that cths shouldn’t even be considered rap because he’s confusing hiphop with a ‘true hollywood story’ “this aint rap this is crazy the way we act  when we confuse hiphop with real life when the music stops”

the string of canibus disses continued throughout the months on a kay slay mixtape eminem did a freestyle over the beat that would later be used for “love me” from the 8 mile soundtrack making a little canibus reference “i live for the love of rap you crazy  i’ve made beats for jayz for free page me  if you need a beat you canibus then it’s dre’s fee  for kay slay the fee’s waved” with still no response from bis em continued on a track from xzibits 4th release man vs machine called “say my name” which was a diss track to everyone who had dissed them in the past months the diss was mainly aimed at jermaine dupri but em took shots at bis as well id rather have my motherfucking ass kicked by moby  before i let some bitch in a can like bis cop over me  to do war and try to bring my crew back down  i’d never stoop to that level to do that now”

in november bis made a return in a big way with his fourth album “mic club the curriculum” out of the thirteen tracks two took outright shots at em the first was “dr c phd” he took a few shots at his hype man proof “if you aint got this album you missin the proof’ and “if you dont like the quality then talk to me  what the fuck you on a website for you creep  punchin the keys  remember that sound cause thats exactly what it sounds like when im punchin ya teeth” but kept most of the dissing around em he lets us know even though he wanted to quit the game he got back in to take care of em got in the groove even though im not in the mood and he lets us know that no matter what he will shine in the limelight of a white emcee my nuclear rocket plumes glow against the pale background of the moon he later brings up the interview i mentioned from the past and he tells em that even though he misinterpreted the meaning of cths he’d know this was an all out attack on him “im spittin divine you cant get it twisted this time and here are some of the more obvious disses to him

motherfucker you didnt win cause i cant lose
give the fans a chance to choose fuck you
whos the illest whos it really up to
rapid fire you better run for the pacifier
tie you up and drown you in a saliva quagmire
till your oxygen expires and ya lungs dry up
cause you said bis aint dope  you a damn liar
…
yo i soak that sugarcoated shit in soy sauce
tell the fcc boss turn that noise off
call detroit’s mafia boss
tell em yo i gotta job for you i want you to bust his balls
drop him off by niagara falls
write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
…
kick a rap bitch  if you got the gumption to speak
stand next to me i might put a lump in ya meat
diss you and ya man double the beef
to tell you the truth i thought ya rebuttal was weak
round the outside blah blah etcetera etcetera
the body of my literature is bigger than south america
nigga look  this is all i got to say
you can suck my phdick
 canibus from “dr c phd”

the second diss was on one of bis’ best songs ever “curriculum 101” in which he dissed the entire rap industry and also dissed em in the process he used a few metaphors to show that in a battle em could get destroyed he makes a reference to the battle with ll when got a tattoo similar to lls canibus is stating that after he defeats eminem he will put a tattoo of a c on eminem to really show how bad he won in contrast to when he got the tattoo of ll when he won that one he also goes on to call em ignorant for a couple of reasons one because his rhymes are plain and simple while he bis used words that shouldn’t rhyme but made them rhyme anyway and two because he misunderstood the true meaning of cths which was to satirize the industry saying he em doesn’t understand what the narrator bis is trying to say about the rap industry

anybody better than bis must be a hoax
black man nope what about the great white hope
what man you must be sniffin great white coke
dont you know thats like gary coleman fightin the hulk
and still not even quite that close
a great white bitin ya rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast
what the fuck is the mathers wit you
ill beat you black and blue then ill probably get a tat of you too
better yet ill put a tattoo of me on you
a 10 by 10 c logo neon blue
the most theatrical mc battle of all time
i rip jackers like you  you know the call sign
the killer cobra thatll hover over jehovah
in a motorized autogiro with sycamore rotors
hydrogen peroxide gaseous vapors
technically these words shouldnt even rhyme off paper
in theory for every soul that can hear me imma blaze em
in practical practice my style’s even greater
cant you see what im spittin cant you hear the difference
compared to me youre energetically inefficient
you need 10 times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
you gotta rewind every one of my lines
do you know how to paraphrase
can you even understand what the narrator is try to say
 canibus from “curriculum 101”

there was also another diss on the mic club album  on the cd itself there is a word search in the word search there are the titles of some of the album tracks curriculum 101  poet laureate drama at for example his names canibus and rip the jacker and even a message to his loyal fanbase one luv to my fans but in paticular they had four words that werent all together but were so close they couldve been connected battle me slim shady they also mention damage control a track that was supposed to be on the album but was taken off at the last minute along with a few other tracks these tracks were apparently titled you dont wanna battle behind the music and a beautiful mind damage control was also rumored to be the fullblown eminem diss go here to see the word search battle is highlighted inb purple and slim shady is highlighted in red  me isnt highlighted but look to the left of battle  youll see it httpimg209imagesrdsearch3iljpg

at the end of 02beginning of 03 em was engaged in another beef this time with coowner of the source benzino in benzino’s first diss he referenced canibus in the lines “you ran to your manager asked him how to handle this  five shades darker motherfucker you’d be canibus  no one would care about your complicated rhyme style  just another backpack rapper out of style” in em’s response “nail in the coffin” he didn’t diss canibus right out but could’ve meant something by it in these lines he started to change his voice to sound like canibus i guess to mock him at the same time “here let me break this shit down  in laymen’s terms for you just to make sure  that you imitating canibus can understand this when canibus aint using  to many complicated fuckin’ words for you” not a diss to bis lyric wise but still it has to be mentioned

in 2003 when bis released two mixtapes to hype people up for his new album “rip the jacker” one of the tapes included “how many emcees” another track that dissed eminem calling him a stan and referring to the past when em called bis names out in songs for no reason he also sends a rebuttal to ems disses towards him from when the music stops from tes here bis lets him know it wasn’t an attempt at dissing him but it was a sick concept of parodying the industry also when bis says at the end ill battle you on the net ill battle you in the flesh  yall niggas know the rest don’t fuck with bis it’s another rebuttal to wtms the ill battle you line is from the dj clue freestyle and with the second line he is saying that you shouldn’t make a satire of my verse there cause mine is better theyll remember that one line and know its better than your shit so don’t fuck with bis

“ya know i think its just time to be grateful
for every emcee that came through and spit tapefulls of data for you
every album before this i made it for you
nowadays the truth is i got nothin to prove
but i heard him call my name a couple times
in a couple of his rhymes and i thought about it a couple of times
is he lookin for a response or is he being a jerk
or am i just to involved in my work
i thought to myself why he put my name in his verse
when he said i wasn’t ill he just made things worse
that’s when i recognized what stan was worth
the only man on earth that could reverse the cool j curse
i served him like a nigga without purpose
constantly taking rip the jacker back and forth to my therapist
i wasn’t prepared for this
people wanna embarrass bis for reasons that are not really apparent to me yet
what i can’t get signed because i got mad at a vet
how could a couple verses have so much anger in em
dont you know the difference between rip the jacker and bis
go use the pythagoras theory and do the math on this
add up every multi syllable paragraph
that i’ve managed to average since january 96
and tell me when you find it you dick ridin bitch
i’m so sick of you bein skeptical always runnin behind my shit
tell me the truth you really think its time that i quit
you think maybe i could wholesale these rhymes that i spit
i guess the nicest emcees got tired of bis
and lied to themselves like they never relied on bis
the real rock of the game people have climed on bis
rhyme more sick than anybody out your clique
with thousands of niggas to vouch for that shit
i got a couple bitches too i make em bow to the dick
the album is sick some hollywood biography shit
the difference between ships in bottles and bottles in ships
fuckin wit rip they find your fossils at the bottoms of cliffs
stick 6 mics up your ass even though i doubt it will fit”
 canibus from “how many emcees”

when the tracklisting to “rip the jacker” first was released 2 or 3 months before the album was released mseacreasy was rumored to be an eminem diss i guess it was to meant something like em is he crazy though he doesn’t go all out at em like he did on mic club he does talk about what kind of emcee mr mathers really is you cant battle me so youd rather embarrass me  i maintain dignity in the face of calamity  they reach out they hand at me and talk dishonestly  but i read through there syntactic structure like noam chomsky you wouldn’t normally think these lines referred to em but i think it did because in the upcoming months em proved this to be true to me on an obie trice mixtape “the bar is open” which was released a week before obie’s debut “cheers” was released it included “funk flex interlude” in this interlude em imitated funkmaster flex saying he will ask the other emcees what they thought about obie which led to em imitating various emcees saying obie is tight the list included busta rhymes snoop dogg dr dre 50 cent jayz and then canibus when he did canibus he used his imitation canibus voice to mock him and spit a few lines imitating his style i guess he did this to let everyone know he hasn’t forgotten about him

eminem in bis’ voice
“yo this is canibus the rhyme analyst
i aint feeling obie trice i hope he gets covered and smothered in tarantulas
before metaphors with reservoir dogs
before christ was hung on the cross before gunfire

normal voice
“get the fuck outta here”
 eminem “funk flex interlude”

on october 20th of 2003 more shots at canibus were taken this time at eminems birthday party not much is really known about that happened but supposedly proof got em to go with him to his favorite club because canibus was going to battle him there note if you look it up most stories say bis was going to battle em but the truth is the match was gonna be bis vs proof proof even put up posters and flyers saying big proof vs canibus which can be seen here httpimg270imagesflyera10pujpg when em got there bis supposedly was waiting for them em was eyeballing him but then proof got up and revealed the guy was actually just a lookalike em then renamed the rapper canibitch again and sat back as big daddy kane and doug e fresh performed a surprise gig for him but things didnt really heat up until the next month in november of 2003 the beef ignited in a full force in that month while em was under fire from the benzino and the media for some basement tapes he made as a teenager for using racial slurs a number of unreleased eminem tracks were leaked including a few disses to benzino and ja rule “bully” and “monkey see monkey do” a track from the next d12 album “six in the morning” two tracks that would make em’s next album a year later “love you more” and “we as americans” and finally the one that matters in this essay “canibitch” the diss track to canibus

some say it was recorded quite a while ago during the c true hollywood stories era  however no one knows for certain i say that’s true it was made during 2002 before tes dropped note how he disses jermaine dupri and the pet shop boys in the third verse they made references to eminem in 2002 and besides if this track was more recent he would’ve dissed benzino or ja rule instead note for those who don’t understand the psb reference in 2002 they made a track called the night i fell in love in which a young male fan has a one night romantic encounter with em it is obviously about em as the fan’s name is stan and the song references dr dre psb singer neil tennant said in a statement that if eminems music was going to be provocative he was going to be provocative back em never mentioned psb or spoke on the song other than this though dre had reportedly said it was funny there are two rumors circulating as to how this track leaked the first is that benzino managed to get hold of a copy of the song and released it in an attempt to create more problems for eminem the second theory is that eminem leaked it himself to divert attention away from the racist basement tapes whichever happened the first real full nonsubliminal diss track had surfaced

the track is over a popstyle beat almost similar to without me starting off with borrowing from slick rick’s “children’s story” eminem attacked canibus in a humorous manner a way which appeared to be an attempt at winding canibus up more than straight up insulting him now you can see how bis’ lyrics from “mseacreasy” made more sense to me lyrics such as 99 of my fans are blonde bis come on answer me man respond made it clear that eminem is ready for the beef to be taken to the next level he went on to attack bis in storytelling fashion saying how bis sent letters to him which led to em going to ‘canada’ to stop him the canada shit was a rumor ll cool j started saying bis was from there originally when he originally was from jamaica he referred to him as “canibitch” “stanabis” and “canadabis” the track was pretty nice as he got at bis in a funny fashion but only using childish tactics to attack him the only real big diss was when he called him a biter still the track was pretty good good enough to get a response out of bis

“so in two seconds flat dres at my crib
the funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship
shit oh dre wait a minute thats it
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
we can fly over the border lets go woosh
so were off to toronto and were gainin speed
boosh what was that oh jermaine dupri
fuck it keep goin no time to waste
wait back up and hit him one more time in case okay
fuck now hes draggin under the car
oh well only 30 more thousand miles
meanwhile me and dre are tryin to conversate
just tryin to find a reason for the constant hate
and tryin to figure out what happened to ‘jermaine propane’
he couldnt have fell of that hard aint no way
what happened to the way you was rappin when you was scandalous
the canibus turned into a television evangelist
plus he raps with his regular voice boosh boosh
boosh boosh what was that pet shop boys
so we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
his corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
he kind of smelled a little like courtney love
i figure if i stick him with a fork hes done
so i stabbed him twice kept jabbin christ
he wont die this guys like a battered wife
hes like kim he keeps comin back for more
but he wont fight back i cracked his jaw
hold up bis quit foldin up
punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch
do somethin at least one punchline
cmon till the meter reads nine nine
ninety nine percent of my fans are blonde
bis cmon answer me man respond
tell me bout the sun rain moon and stars
interglacial metaphors from mars
raw to the floor raw like reservoir dogs
bite another line from redmans song
suddenly the stub from a dead mans arm
from a midget reaches out from under the car
its jd this motherfucker wont die neither
dre starts sprayin him with cans of ether
we stomped the bitch and then stomped the bitch again
compton detroit bitch talk some shit again
stomp him switch feet stomp him switch again
dre alright hes dead dog quit kickin him
i think stanabis jumped off the bridge again damn
he disappeared yo hes gone he did it again”
 eminem third verse of “canibitch”

for most of 2004 the beef had died down and bis was absent from the hiphop scene due to his duties in the us military he did a few shows and radio appearances to promote the new single “who writes the song” which he did with jeymes samuel the brother of rb artist seal but finally bis appeared back in the us with some answers to some questions on august 22nd 2004 canibus appeared on the wake up show with sway and king tech when he was asked about eminem he was not reluctant to answer questions when sway asked when it started bis said the phrase ‘the best bump heads at the top’ explained it he said he was still in the ‘second round ko’ mania so he didn’t look at him as anyone important so when they began to bump heads a bit in their tracks bis said that em was aware of his style and liked his music and bis said after hearing him he liked his music too but basically bis blamed it all on communication problems

sway then mentioned the “canibitch” diss track and bis said that when he was in the army someone played the track for him there bis explained that the track didn’t start a fire in him because he felt em didn’t really say anything worthwhile he said em ripped everlast jermaine dupri and benzino but the “canibitch” track was a weak attempt and hardly an all out assault on him he felt that em was just taking jabs at bis since bis took jabs at him first bis said he’s more interested in ‘fusing relationships’ then battling but he would retaliate if em dissed him bis then said that a week before an intern from shady records called him up and asked him if he wanted to battle someone at riggs morales fight klub which is a place in new york where any emcee can battle any emcee regardless of whether they are signed or unsigned he later got an email from someone most likely a fan saying that em was the one that wanted to battle at fight klub bis said he’s been contemplating the fight klub thing and stated to em “we dont have to draw it back to 8 mile but if you want to draw it back to 8 mile i’ll be right there with a smile on my face” nothing more ever evolved out of the fight klub challenge though it is rumored that em wasnt up for the challenge when mic club called shady back and challenged em to an actual battle either way in an interview with allhiphopcom from april of 2005 bis had said the battle was over for him

allhiphopcom with the battle circuit heating up and the fight klub putting up a million dollars as prize money for an upcoming battle would you consider battling again

canibus no the battle is over for me im free to make music and elevate the art its time to rebuild

em was never asked about the beef that much but canibus would be asked about it in nearly every interview in some interviews he gave em props but still wouldnt put him above himself in one interview from 2003 bis had said this about em his wordplay is phenomenal his rhythm is impeccable his mind is sick and twisted which is a good thing and his star quality is absolutely explosive now having said that do i think hes better than rtj fuck no it was obvious bis was fed up with being asked about it as in one 2003 interview he had started responding sarcastically saying that he and em love each other and then saying we meet at 330 am every thursday and battle it out one on oneno cameras media or witnesses just like rocky and apollo creed but i remember one interview that not many people know about that caught my eye let me explain on a canibus fan site known as canibusworldcom it was figured out that bis had been secretly posting on the site under the name da watcha one of the sites mods thetruth had set up a qa session with bis before he left this took place in september of 2004 one month after the wake up show interview mentioned in the previous paragraph in this questionare bis had said that due to the events that happpened between him and em in the past he took the song stan personally among other things

3 what was the reasoningmeaning behind cths
ironically i take pleasure in seeing what it means to you all i sometimes picture that there is a gauntlet of pissed off people that i have to run through about cths in the songs that were recorded around that time i mildly remember quotes here and there about my mentalmusicalemotional state statements that came from me of course i was disillusioned with the relationship between what i wanted and what i already had i wanted eminem to know that i took stan personally because of what transpired between us both i will come clean and tell you that i played the asshole role and hurt him deeply if its of any consolation to you i was crushed 10 fold when i heard stan yes besides the fact that i heard the record maybe a couple hundred short of 1 million times even then i knew that my opportunity to make things right with em was nil i was off of universal emi had lapsed my publishing deal and i had recorded material to seek another deal  the time it seemed lucrative to release an lp independently as i had seen with cah money master percy and daz who was eating like a mad dog off that shit as per my conversation with wendy day she was encouraging and helpful to me i was later introduced to louis lombard who release the priesthood album which happened to be a name that we bis  killah priest coined drunk off some gramarne i dont drink anymore louis had explained some things to me i had never heard before and thus cths was born cths was my 3rd release my 4th and 5th were lyrical beasts the cthsmic clubrtj trilogy is undeliberate they are independent of each other the only link between them is me i wonder if what happened at the video shoot and some of the following events the tour bus meeting  the syracuse ny show the show at the long island coliseum the cold face off at cheung king were just buttons being snapped up on a shirt i was destined to wear i was still entangled in the backlash of battling l the beef ii dvd shows that my music career was more of an unplanned publicity stunt for l than it was for what i came in the fuckin game to do in the first place i was like the wrestler of the week or something i have been unable to make amends with l because he acts like he hates me even my mother thinks hes sexy like he says but she dont feel him cause she knows the effect that 2nd round ko shit had on my life onehitblunder i was a champ in hip hop for a hot sec i respected l enough to get tatted up and give him a run for his skully i revered him enough now to say he changed my life for the better because i found purpose maybe my effect on hip hop helped others find purpose also canibus aint a lifestyle canibus is the 9th mile  sike im just playin but i bet i made ya smile read it was all in the name of hip hop nobody really got hurt honest to god if i can look back and say that i had a good time how can ll or eminem say they had a bad one

the qa session was split into two parts and this was from part two go here httpwwwcanibuscentralcomsitemediainterviews008php to read part 2 and go here httpwwwcanibuscentralcomsitemediainterviews007php to read part 1

no real attempts have been made by one to outright diss the other since then though it seems that they would continue to take subliminal at each other whether this is true or not is unknown as the disses in this paragraph are pure speculation but i’mma say it anyway since it is possible first off in a track titled i wish u would that featured chino xl and royce da 59 from the sway and tech album back 2 basics a lot of people speculated that a good amount of bis’ verse was aimed at eminem as he proclaims that he will beat him up with his fans around saying i don’t give a fuck if youre a star or not” he also says fuck who you roll with your mans a clown nigga and many believed that referenced dr dre it also could’ve referenced 50 cent and the one line that convinced everyone it was directed at em the line they think referenced gunit the guerilla unit “hang around guerrillasgorillas your fragrance becomes apeish” now as for the eminem ‘shot’ at bis it was supposedly on his 2004 album “encore” in the track “never enough” a lot of people think these lines refer to bis “sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me  and when you face me with all that shit you’ve been saving  to say to me you had all this time to think about it now  don’t pussy out and try to about face me  cause i’ve been ‘patiently waiting’ for the day  we finally meet in the same place to see…” the logic is this hes basically saying that bis has had time to come up with content for the battle bein that he was overseas and that em has been waiting for him to come back now that bis has been back a bit he seems to want to squash and move on as i said before bis said he had heard rumors that em was gonna come out and face him i think em is addressing the issue about bis not accepting the challenge plus the about face me line could be taken as a reference to bis having been in the army

in the beginning of 2005 however it seemed the beef wouldnt hype up as bis would continue to give em props a new canibus mixtape titled “the virtuvian man” containing some recent kay slay freestyles as well as some leaked material that was supposed to be for his next album hiphop for sale the mixtape had bis taking a slightly different route then his recent ‘rip the jacker’ style dumbing down his large vocabulary while still dropping some ill lyrics on the track “dear academy” where he shouts out all his friends who made it in the industry like common for example “nominated for being underrated  we ‘made a name for ourselves’ but i guess common was the only one who made it” he mentioned em and d12 in the second verse as he pretended to be in the audience of an award show whispering in awe about all the people he’s sitting with “d12 me and them struck a pose man  with slim shady yo this must be an omen” in the third verse he makes another reference to eminem one that could be taken either way as a diss or showing props “i’m in the game now i ran 8 miles  i ain’t the same old nigga with the same style” most of the material from that bootleg recorded for hiphop for sale including that dear academy track made it onto the album when it was released in november 2005

a few days after the virtuvian man was leaked another canibus song was leaked where he addressed the beef between him and eminem directly the production on it was similar to the production on cths but bis lyrics were fire being an unreleased mixtape verse it didnt have an official title but the ballad was the tag title given to it youll see why in a second it seemed to be an old song made in the uk from 2001 or 2002 as he says in the middle of it im working on my fourth album which was 2002s mic club in it he references his beef with ll cool j im illmatic like nas and stillmatic like escobar  no im not still at it with todd  dont blame me it aint my fault it never was  before i even knew him i already had a buzz  but that was then and this is now  bis been rippin it down since the day he came out and talks about alica keyes which shows how the infatuation with alicia keyes line in poet laureate 2 makes sense i wanna give alicia keyes a kiss  compose a ballad and just make her fiend for bis but the beginning of it is about his beef with eminem he starts out by referencing an advertisement for cths that he put in the source in 2002 that had a picture of stan and eminem he says he did it for a little controversy he goes on to call eminems rhymes very weak at the end of the song he calls em out and tells him if hes going to diss him he needs to diss him outright instead of the few times he did subliminally on the eminem show in the outro he says something to the effect ill take you on mano e mano showing that bis was ready for this beef to be taken to the next level here are the lines about em

im about 8000 miles away from home
thinking about the throne i got my eyes fixated on
i just put an add in the source to cause a little controversy
came from doing a concert in jersey last thursday
a kid said eminem wanted to hurt me
he called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
his rhyme is very weak i didnt know he had words for me
i bet hes probably never even heard of me
ever since i met stan he took it kinda personally
it didnt even occur to me he was involved personally
with stan earlier than me now hes perturbed at me
i seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
he told me him and d12 were gonna murder me
and anytime that im ready that hes got a verse for me
damn i didnt know he was that thirsty for me
i guess he aint the only emcee thats nervous of me
there aint a person in the game wit more courage than me
from france to germany they call me the merchant of beef

damn i can write raps im good at it aint i
niggas call my name out cuz they want the mic back
but i raise the price so high that in fact
the market is collapsed and niggas dont know how to act
i guess the worlds chaos is spinning over the raps
they make you sign a contract and con you out of your tracks
dont act like you dont know bis
the man with the organic tongue and the golden spit

im an extremist when im on some mc shit
and after this you could never not believe in bis
terry stone uk clique keepin it thick
use my name motherfucker when you speakin to bis
 canibus exclusive freestyle aka the ballad

as time went on canibus seemed to drop more supposed references to em in late 2005 bis signed with head trauma records and hooked up with phoenix orion to form the duo cloak and dagger who would go on to drop an album titled def con zero in a exclusive mixtape freestyle bis went on to promote dcz and managed to confirm that a sequel to mic club the curriculum was being made people say canibus whats up with you  when you coming out with something new  curriculum 2 coming soon dont even trip my nigga in this freestyle he dropped a few lines that couldve been making reference to em as well as the supposed fight klub battle i charge 500 gs or better for fight klub and detonate mines run 8 miles 8 times on the dcz album there was a song called close to me where bis said a few lines that couldve been attacking em first he said a line that referenced like toy soldiers the song where em attempted to squash beef with ja rule and benzino wake up smell the roses the fuckin toy soldiers  have styrofoam shoulders and cant stay focused bis also said battle watch the faggot bail which couldve been a reference to em supposedly bailing on the fight klub battle

bis released three albums in 2005 mind control originally recorded in 2001 but remained unreleased due to bis disputes with a former label the previously mentioned hiphop for sale which included a few new tracks as well as some tracks from the virtuvian man bootleg and the previously mentioned def con zero he also released a mixtape on his website titled mic club master vol 1 which was made up of a few new songs that bis had recorded while in the army as well as some old classics one of the new songs on one of the new songs yeng meng it sounded to me like bis was going off on someone is it possible that he was going at em maybe as the songs hook first sounded like he was speaking on the constant rumors that spread through the streets niggas runnin around like what did he say  all day everyday what did he say  everybody want to know what did you say as bis starts into his verse it sounds like hes directing his attention to a certain someone its likely that it could be about em but more likely that its about his fickle fanbase yo i dont want to waste no lyrics talkin about you  just let my body die and rot in hell why dont you  you asked the same question i already told you  im a lyricist i do what im supposed to do  you ever wonder what hiphop would have been without me  im six albums deep somebody is thinkin about me  whether its good or bad yo i cant control it  a niggas opinion belongs to him i cant own it even if he didnt get at em in a negative way in this song there was definitely a reference to em in that interview taking back what he said about bis being dope even the best confessed at some point in they life they said  that im the illest but now they want you to forget

as time went on both parties seem to have let the beef die down the difference between the two is while ems mainstream fan base could care less if he gets at bis bis fanbase still want him to rip em to shreds in 2007 bis released a new record titled for whom the beat tolls and did a few shows in the us to promote the record at one particular show at the knitting factory in hollywood ca bis let a fan in the audience get on the mic to which that fan proceeded to shout its all about canibus fuck eminem to which the whole crowd started cheering bis wasted no time in trying to peacefully resolve the situation hold up aiiyo em em or whoever when you see it man dont get tight at me he said it he continued on and with one sentence bis pretty much confirmed that the most theatrical emcee battle of all time was over but look though i aint on that shit i aint beefin with them niggas imma do my shit the entire incident can be viewed here

heres whats been going on for the two emcees as of october 2007

since the release of for whom the beat tolls in june canibus has split ways with his label mic club music and longtime partner louis lombard he is currently signed to waste management records a label owned by def squad member ksolo there has been no news about any new canibus records though a few rumors have started spreading lately the rumors range from him retiring to him signing with murder inc

as for eminem he spent all of 2005 dropping guest verses for his artists on the shadyaftermath label as well as a few that werent on the label it was rumored in july of 05 that em was retiring from the rap game but he later dismissed these rumor as being false according to em he was just taking a long break from rapping focusing more on his production for other artists at the end of 2005 em released curtain call a greatest hits compilation containing all his popular singles as well as three new songs in mid 2006 em decided to extend his leave of absence from music after the tragic death of his best friend proof and divorcing from his wife kim whom he remarried in early 06 at the end of 2006 em dropped the reup a compilation album that featured new tracks from him as well as newer artists on his shady records label the rumors of a new eminem album have been running rampant and most people believe we will see a new album released sometime in 2008

but what’s next battle wise for the two emcees no one really knows you can’t evaluate where the battle will escalate from here but you can make your predictions my prediction is that this will never go down officially on stage or on wax when em took his extended leave of absence from the mic there was is no chance of this beef ever happening in my personal opinion the only way this beef would ever heat up again is if bis decided to pull a jayz and drop a massive diss track that’ll start a fire in em the same way jigga did to nas with “takeover” unfortunately it doesn’t seem that will happen as bis has expressed no more interest in battling anyone let alone em im more interested in fusing relationships the battle is over for me i aint beefing with them etc as long as this beef as gone on you can not come up with a clear cleancut winner because there hasn’t been enough fullfledged diss tracks exchanged to decide that you can speculate with all the subliminal tracks mentioned in this essay some of which possibly aren’t even intended as disses and when you do it looks pretty even and the battle could go either way but if you wanna really determine a winner you can’t cause when you get right down to it the only real fullfledged diss track was “canibitch” and that song wasn’t meant to be released it leaked more than a year after it was recorded if you want my opinion with all these songs all these disses subliminal and outright this battle is nothing more than a draw

but is that really the end of this battle will “the most theatrical emcee battle of all time” never go down you can’t tell but never say never cause old feuds never really die they are just buried away for a while but someday it is bound to be brought up whether by em or bis or their fans or interviewers so in the words of em himself stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo1embed"
