sweet creature
had another talk about where its going wrong
but were still young
we dont know where were going
but we know where we belong

and oh we started
two hearts in one home
its hard when we argue
were both stubborn i know
but oh

sweet creature sweet creature
wherever i go you bring me home
sweet creature sweet creature
when i run out of road you bring me home
