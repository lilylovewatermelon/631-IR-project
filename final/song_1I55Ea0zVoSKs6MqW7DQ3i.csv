verse
i dont cop things for resale dont do icloud dont do email
feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like chubbs did detail
back when ricky was doin up teesdale i was doin dinner with teezy
i didnt trust no one swore gyal lined me cause gyal too greazy
niko never move neeky sweatsuit nike sweatsuit dg
if man get beaky ring ring call up gigi do him up neatly
used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
thought he was a bad boy then til man got pinched and man went pc
man went pc just like dell and windows some man been those
before i was ever around kendalls i was at ends though dreamin up enzos
the woman i do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like munchie
cant have no pretentious ting when i know this road gets bumpy
word to the broski jay he got different names in different countries
three waps in the whip and we beat that case where man live way too comfy
i dont do well with people makin disses or makin threats
woioi man got flown like private jets for way way less
i know you tried to get one down on us ever since then its been stress
cause you know the rest dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
wassa wassa just like the crodie pressa i dont do no passa
link with skull and cuz and jamie ah yard and we deh pon gaza
pasha sasha pissed i was way too young at the time for slashings
you niggas spend too much time on captions not enough time on action
pick one man with slaps thats rappin i bet he dont want no clashings
the lv pouch on chest is just for fashion niggas just actin
are you dumb or stupid the wheels on the rolls is chromazz headshot domazz
just checked in at a hotel floor that we on got potent aromas
ovoxo link up mandem drink up me and the drillers
hawk and sticks and cash and baka gucci p and gilla
and the boy that sound like he sang on thriller you know thats been my nigga
yeah we just had to fix things family 6ix tings we cant split up
as for the rest of the game ill do man dirty manll get two time
to me thats just our side i dont really care who rides on whose side
bring ten shots to the poolside never seen none of these grown men outside
4301 wont spare no one niggas gotta know about southside
steppin outta line get outlined and you know im tied up stateside
bringin man down when they take sides tryna get saved by the bell like bayside
prince i carry that last name that shit stays on me like brand names
jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
everyone i know has codenames anyone im beefin with is a noname
niggas cant even win home games they just gotta fall in line like soul train
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeoutro

yeah
