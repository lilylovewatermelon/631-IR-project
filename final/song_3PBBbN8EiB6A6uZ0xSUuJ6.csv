bitches flyin all the way from europe to me yeah

verse 1
anybody came around i turnt them up
aint nobody gave me shit i earned this stuff
all cap aside who really turnt as us
academics niggas think they cant get touched
i dont be on computers much ced turned me on to youtube
i keep tryna tell em im different from what they used to
we cant go to war fuck this money up is what i tell the bro dem
everybody wanna be killers now i aint even gon go there
i know real steppers with body counts dont nobody know them
i won four ms off of baccarat and didnt even buy nothin
invest a lil somethin into moonpay just to try somethin that aint it
mama get her hair done when she want she got her own salon
tryna find a nanny that jason like so i can keep him with me
real gambler plenty times i fucked it up and got it right the same night
you ever heard that little joe can change your life
im talkin shootin dice i know that went over they head
and without me more than half of these rappers wouldnt have no legs
what i mean is im really the reason niggas think they big as me damn
they couldnt see the old me i done revamped
