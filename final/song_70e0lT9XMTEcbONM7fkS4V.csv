now that all the smoke is gone lighter
and the battles finally won give me a lighter
victory’s finally ours lighters up lighters up
history so loved so long so long so long

verse 1 jayz
in search of victory she keeps eluding me
if only we could be together momentarily
we could make love and make history
why won’t you visit me until she visits me
i’ll be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
ive practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave
i know what this means i’m stuck in this routine
whole new different day but the same old things
all i got is dreams but nobody else could see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history

chorus tony williams
now that all the smoke is gone lighter
and the battles finally won give me a lighter
victory’s finally ours lighters up lighters up
history so loved so long so long so long

so now i’m flirting with death
hustling like a g while victory wasn’t watching
took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne
before i got proactive i couldn’t face she
i just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
a success is like lust shes good for the touch
shes good for the moment but she’s never enough
everybody’s had her she’s nothing like v
a success is all i got unfortunately
but i’m burning down the block hopin in and out of vs
but something tells me that there’s much more to see
before i get killed cause i can’t get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history

chorus tony williams
now that all the smoke is gone lighter
and the battles finally won give me a lighter
victory’s finally ours lighters up lighters up
history so loved so long so long so long

verse 3 jayz
now victory is mine she tastes so sweet
she’s my trophy wife shes coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
he’s my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past he’ll explain who i be
rank me amongst the greats either 1 2 or 3
if i ain’t number one then i failed you victory
ain’t in it for the fame that dies within weeks
ain’t in it for the money can’t take it when you leave
i wanna be remembered long after you grieve
long after i’m gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song it’s a baby shower
i’ve been waiting for this hour history youre ours5embed"
