i am exploring the inside i find it desolate
i do implore these confines now as they penetrate recreate me

prehook
im hovering throughout time i crumble in these days
i crumble i cannot i cannot find reflection in these days

hook
if you listen listen listen
listen close beat by beat
you can hear when the heart stops i saved the pieces
when it broke and ground them all to dust

verse 2
i am destroyed by the inside i disassociate
i hope to destroy the outside it will alleviate and elevate me

prehook 2
like water flowing into lungs im flowing through these days
like morphine cuts through through dead end veins im numbing in these days
so

hook
if you listen listen listen
listen close beat by beat
you can hear when the heart stops i saved the pieces
when it broke and ground them all to dust

i know what died that night it can never be brought back to life
once again i know

i know i died that night and ill never be brought back to life
once again i know

i know i died that night and ill never be brought back to life
once again i know

hook
if you listen listen listen
listen close beat by beat
you can hear when the heart stops i saved the pieces
when it broke and ground them all to dust
so

if you listen listen listen
listen close it dies beat by beat
you can hear when the heart stops i saved the pieces
when it broke and ground them all to dust3embed"
