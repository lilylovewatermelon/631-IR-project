this world
this world is cold
but you dont
you dont have to go
youre feeling sad youre feeling lonely
and no one seems to care
your mothers gone and your father hits you
this pain you cannot bear

prechorus
but we all bleed the same way as you do
and we all have the same things to go through

chorus
hold on if you feel like letting go
hold on it gets better than you know

verse 2
your days
you say theyre way too long
and your nights
you cant sleep at all hold on
and youre not sure what youre waiting for
but you dont want to no more
and youre not sure what youre looking for
but you dont want to no more

but we all bleed the same way as you do
and we all have the same things to go through

hold on it gets better than you know

bridge
what are you looking for
what are you waiting for
do you know what youre doing to me

chorus
hold on if you feel like letting go
hold on it gets better than you know

postchorus
dont stop looking youre one step closer
dont stop searching its not over
chorus
hold on if you feel like letting go
hold on it gets better than you know hold on
