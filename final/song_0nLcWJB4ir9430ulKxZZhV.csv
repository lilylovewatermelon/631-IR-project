intro otis redding  jayz
it makes it easier easier to bear
you wont regret it no no no
some girls they dont forget it
love is their only happiness
squee— squee— squee—
sounds so soulful dont you agree
squeeze her dont tease her never leave her

verse 1 jayz
uh i invented swag
poppin bottles puttin supermodels in the cab
proof
i guess i got my swagger back truth
new watch alert hublots
or the bigface rollie i got two of those
arm out the window through the city i maneuver slow
cock back snapback see my cut through the holes hov

verse 2 kanye west
damn yeezy and hov where the hell you been
niggas talking real reckless stuntmen
i adopted these niggas phillip drummond them
now im bout to make em tuck they whole summer in
they say im crazy well im bout to go dumb again
they aint seen me cause i pulled up in my other benz
last week i was in my other other benz
throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain
