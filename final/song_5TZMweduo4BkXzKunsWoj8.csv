girl the last time you saw me i wasnt this cool
and i’m hanging out in mexico down by the pool
in cabo cabo san lucas
if i send you a ticket would you fly in
id sure like to see you we could hook up again
in cabo cabo san lucas

chorus
i know it sounds crazy but i bought a guitar
and i’m singing my songs downtown in a bar
you can come with a friend you can come by yourself
you can sleep here with me i aint got nobody else
in cabo cabo san lucas

verse 2
well the baja gets hot this time of year
and except for the fisherman they all disappear
in cabo cabo san lucas
pacifico is great tequila is too
i got it all going but i aint got you
in cabo cabo san lucas

chorus
i know it sounds crazy but i bought a guitar
and i’m singing my songs downtown in a bar
you can come with a friend you can come by yourself
you can sleep here with me i aint got nobody else
in cabo cabo san lucas

ill show you the stars and the moon on the sea of cortez
and the beach at san juan as the suns sinking down in the west
im leaving you this message and if you give a damn
and you want to call me you know where i am in cabo cabo san lucas
way down in mexico
way down in caboembed"
