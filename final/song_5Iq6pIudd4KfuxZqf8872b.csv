well lord i need you to wrap your arms around me
wrap your arms around with your mercy
lord i need you to wrap your arms around me
i give up on doin things my way
and tell me everythings gonna be alright oh

verse
when you said give me a ring you really meant a ring huh
turned out to be more than just a fling huh
three hours to get back from palm springs huh
who you know spend an hour in walgreens huh
you know youll always be my favorite prom queen
even when we in dad shoes or mom jeans
too many complaints made it hard for me to think
would you shut up i cant hear myself drink
we used to do the freak like seven days a week
its the best collab since taco bell and kfc uh
talk to me nicely dont come at me loud
you had a benz at sixteen i could barely afford a audi
how you gon try to say sometimes its not about me
man i dont know what i would do without me
billionaire sport step up to the court
they rented a room we bought the resort
god got me baby god got the children
the devil run the playground but god own the buildin
time and silence a luxury
cussin at your baby mama guess thats why they call it custody
god got us baby god got the children
the devil run the playground but god own the buildin
time and space is a luxury
but you came here to show that you still in love with me
startin to feel like you aint been happy for me lately darlin
member when you used to come around and serenade me woah
but i guess its gone different in a different direction lately
tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me wheezy outta here
your gun off safety
speak first dont break me
harsh words youre angry
lord dont take me oh oh

well lord i need you to wrap your arms around me
wrap your arms around with your mercy
lord i need you to wrap your arms around me
i give up on doin things my way
and tell me everythings gonna be alright oh wheezy outta here31embed"
