do you love me for me though
the real me not my fly alterego
i know im never not fly
but if i ever was would you still ride

verse 1
if its early in the morning and my breath stink
would you still roll over kissin on me like it aint
if i didnt have millions in the bank
im talkin cardboard box and a fish tank
better yet a fish bowl
and if the fame got old
if the cameras didnt flash when i walk through
if i wasnt makin them bands when i walk through
is it where i lost you or is you holding me down
you never let em bring me down
all the haters in the world right now
would you add to the stress or would you make it easy

chorus
for me to take it easy
thats what im lookin for baby let me know
would you make it easy
easy for me to chill easy for us to feel
easy to take it easy
thats what im looking for baby let me know

chorus
for me to take it easy
