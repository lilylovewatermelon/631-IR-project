lily and robin enter in a house…



robin  wow its beautiful lily

lily  yeah its just how i always pictured it



ted 2030  well that was a load of crap you see kids when you get married you learn a hard lesson the wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with



at the bar 8 months before the wedding…



lily  so weve decided on a small outdoor wedding just family and close friends no more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle

barney  and maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she he could perform the ceremony
robin  but you hate marriage why do you want to perform the ceremony

barney  because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when i ask a question you say i do yeah



ted 2030  the closer you get to the big day the more concessions you make



at the apartment 6 months before the wedding…



lily  great now my moms making me invite the lessners this puts our numbers in the triple digits

robin  wow i guess sometimes lessner is more ner you know how like sometimes less is more

ted  yeah this is one of those times sweetie

marshall  you know what thats okay itll be a slightly big outdoor wedding



at the bar 5 months before the wedding…


lily  so its not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore marshalls dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in new york hes going to get mugged so its going to be inside now itll be great were still going to have our acoustic guitar player



at the apartment 3 months before the wedding…



lily  so now instead of an acoustic guitar were having a harp player yeah my dad owes a guy and that guys daughter plays the harp

barney  is she hot id love to be able to cross harp player off my list

marshall  how long is this list

barney  dude im not gonna count how many pages the list is im not crass

lily  well it doesnt matter anyway shes pregnant

barney  sweet i can cross off two things



credits

in marshall’s room…



ted  okay we have a bit of a situation lets not panic lets just find a solution

marshall takes a razor and shaves the middle of his hair… dude you shaved your freakin head

marshall  yeah yeah but its good i ought to shave it all off what a great solution just be bald cause its cool right bruce willis michael jordan britney spears oh god what did i do how could you let me shave my head

ted  what

marshall  youre the worst best man ever i hate you im not going out there im leaving and im never coming backim gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in zihautanejo

ted  dude those guys are criminals

marshall  only red andy was falsely accused ted youre my best man you got to do something

ted  okay all right come here just breathe breathe all right dont worry dont worry ill just ill take these

marshall  no



ted’s in the wedding room…



ted  uh hi uncle ben right

ben  yes

ted  yes were were having a little bit of a problem back there um and i was wondering if you could help us out

ben  yeah

ted  marshall accidentally shaved part of his head

ben  oh no

ted  yeah yeah so heres what i was thinking what if i found something to cover up the bald area

ben  yeah that would probably work but with what thats a tough one

ted   maybe a wig of some sort or a um toupee something that matches

his hair color which is which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair

ben  mm yeah does anyone here wear a toupee ben’s wearing a toupee shouldnt be hard to find out most of them are pretty bad

ted  that is true that is true we just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as marshalls and your hair

ben  boy thats a pretty tall order

ted  really you cant think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind im describing to you

ben  no not off the top of my no cant

ted let me come at this from a different angle i got 50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more barney comes and takes the toupee

barney  the bride needs this



13 minutes before the wedding marshall’s wearing the toupee



marshall  actually i think it kinda works

ted  it totally does

marshall  barney

barney  to be honest im uh im jealous i dont get to wear it

marshall  okay problem solved crisis averted lets get me married it looks terrible doesnt it

ted it kinda looks like fur which gives you the appearance of a cleanedup bigfoot

marshall  oh you know

ted  in a bad way

brad  hey cool hair bro

ted  what happened to your shirt

brad  i got sauce on it when i tackled the caterer

ted you gonna put another shirt on

brad  no im good hey you guys seen scooter

marshall  what what scooters here that guys at my wedding

brad  not for long bro not for long

marshall  okay you know what i need some air i think we should go for a walk okay



in the park…



barney  it would cover up the problem its festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation

ted  okay unless you actually have one in your car stop suggesting authentic native american headdress
