at a truck stop in san angelo
i saw a billboard about this rodeo
this weekend out in el paso
so i signed up to ride
i drew a bull called original sin
i heard hed killed a couple of men
thinking this was something i could win
cause the devil was on my side
i was having myself one hell of a ride
but i ended up disqualified
that old bull just up and died
before they blew the whistle

chorus
with them north texas blues thought id paid all my dues
then them south texas blues told me son you aint through
had the east texas blues and the west texas too
ive done all i know to do trying to lose
trying to lose these old lone star blues

verse 2
well i got laid off at brown  root
then on my way back to cut and shoot
i lost my wristwatch and my boots
shooting dice with a dude from houston
well there aint no jobs here working cattle
so i got on part time hauling gravel
with some outfit from seattle
down here building custom homes

with them north texas blues thought id paid all my dues
then them south texas blues told me son you aint through
had the east texas blues and the west texas too
ive done all i know to do trying to lose
trying to lose these old lone star blues

verse 3
well i gassed my truck and i packed my clothes
turned in the key and hit the road
i said cowtowns where ill go
you never know i might get lucky
well i got a friend there turning knobs
at a place called billy bobs
said he could get me a job there
working as a bouncer
first night on the job was just insane
some ole boy got all deranged
hit me in the head with a harley chain
to this day my ears still ring

chorus
with them north texas blues thought id paid all my dues
then them south texas blues told me son you aint through
had the east texas blues and the west texas too
ive done all i know to do trying to lose
trying to lose these old lone star blues
outro
ive done all i know to do trying to lose
trying to lose these old lone star bluesembed"
