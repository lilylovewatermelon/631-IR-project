verse 1
in the beginning trouble times in my life
i needed a shoulder to cry on just needed a shoulder
had no direction until i met you
everything is gonna be alright
looking out beyond the stars
searching always wishing
often i thought that love would escape me
you got the key babe

i have the chance to find the key to my dreams
and i know that its so good for me
once in a lifetime in my life
i have the chance to find the key to my dreams
and i know that its so good for me

you took my hand and chased my blues away
your inspiration is guiding me through

memories of days gone by
hurting always hurting
youve taken my pain away finally
you set me free babe
