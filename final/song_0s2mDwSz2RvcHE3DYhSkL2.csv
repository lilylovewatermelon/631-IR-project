so long to the bad vibes
new york is coming soon
please be my calm
dust off your ignorance
the amazon is where i belong
where did and how did we go wrong

chorus
wont somebody but me shout
keep strong and fight with your self doubt
my lungs were riddled with our fears
so long im gone so fuck your tears

verse 2
farewell to the bad times
shrug off your common sense
soon ill be running wild
getting lost in paradise
the amazon is where i belong
you made and i made us go wrong
to live more ill take what im owed
so breathe through the seeds that weve sowed

chorus
wont somebody but me shout
keep strong and fight with your self doubt
my lungs were riddled with our fears
so long im gone so fuck your tears
see palace liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
my silence is spoken
i leave you this token
i run from this day
so heres all ill say

outro
so long forever
so long forever
so long forever
so long forever

so long forever
so long forever
so long forever
so long foreverembed"
