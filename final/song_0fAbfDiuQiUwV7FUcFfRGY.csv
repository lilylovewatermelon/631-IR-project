ahahah
ahahah

verse 1
you were in college working part time waitin tables
left a small town never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wonderin why we bother with love if it never lasts

prechorus
i say can you believe it
as were lyin on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now

chorus
do you remember we were sittin there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine

verse 2
flash forward and were takin on the world together
and theres a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why im guarded
you say well never make my parents mistakes
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeprechorus
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes yes this is what i thought about

chorus
do you remember we were sittin there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine

postchorus
ohohoh

bridge
and i remember that fight 230 am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
cause thats all ive ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said ill never leave you alone
chorus
you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you its like the first time
i fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
she is the best thing thats ever been mine

postchorus
hold on make it last
hold on never turn back
hold on you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter make it last
hold on you are the best thing thats ever been mine hold on

outro
do you believe it hold on
were gonna make it now hold on
and i can see it
yeah yeah i can see it nowembed"
