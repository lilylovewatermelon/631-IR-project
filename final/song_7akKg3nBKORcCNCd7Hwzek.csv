if we cut out the bad
well then wed have nothing left
like i cut up your mouth
the night i stuffed it all in
and you lied to the angels
said i stabbed you to death
if we go at the same time
theyll clean up the mess

chorus
i lost my head
you couldnt come
this lust to my brain almost feels like a gun

verse 2
watched you bite into the bottle
watched me kick out the chair
let you chew up the glass
and laughed as you just hung there
i had thought of rose petals most perfectly pure
then i thought of your petals
and the abuse theyve been through

chorus
i lost my head
you couldnt come
this lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
you lost your head
i couldnt come
this lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
almost feels like a gun
almost feels like a gun
woah woah

i told the angels woah woah
canâ€™t stay in heaven woah
i asked the devil the devil the devil woah

refrain
if we cut out the bad
well then wed have nothing left
like i cut up your angels
yeah you stabbed me to death

chorus
i lost my head
you couldnt come
this lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
you lost your head
i couldnt come
this lust to my brain almost feels just like a gun now
i lost my head
you couldnt come
lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
i lost my head
you couldnt come
lust to my brain almost feels like a gun
almost feels like a gun
almost feels like a gun
outro
feels like a gun
feels like a gun
feels like a gun
