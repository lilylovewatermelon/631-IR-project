i was a human breathing and thinking
eating and drinking philosophizing
i was a human before you killed me
and ripped my heart out i knew what love was

prechorus
now when they ask me i just reply slow
and sound like an iphone
i do not know love i am a robot
ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
i do not know love i am a robot
ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
i used to know love

chorus
cause i had a fire passion and desire
now all i require are circuits and wires
inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
then you cut me open now all that i know is—

verse 2
i am a robot thoughtless and empty
dont know who sent me dont know who made me

numb to the pain now i knew what love was
