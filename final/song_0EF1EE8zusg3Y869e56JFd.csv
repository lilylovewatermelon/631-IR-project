i wanna heal be hugged
its just the two of us
or thats what we swore
and if ive lost my charm
apologies due no harm
cause youve got ahold of my heart
and i know its worn

so wont you please spare me indignity
and wont you please give me some decency
and wont you please call it if our time is through
cause i know that we fall apart when nothings new
nothings new

i want to be close to you
but i dont know what to do
cause if we are near to through
it may make it worsе
and if i start to grieve
cause it feels yourе bout to leave
forgive me im not naïve
ive been here before
so wont you please spare me indignity
and wont you please give me some decency
and wont you please call it if our time is through
cause i know that we fall apart when nothings new
nothings new

please spare me indignity
and wont you please give me some decency
and wont you please call it if our time is through
cause i know that we fall apart when nothings new
