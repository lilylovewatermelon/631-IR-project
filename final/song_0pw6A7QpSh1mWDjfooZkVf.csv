another day stuck in repeat
another someone judging me
another hour i hold it in
another time i force a grin

another god who doesnt speak
another leader thats a thief
another day without a choice
another day without a voice

prechorus
ill hold it in ill hold it in ill hold it in
forget it now

chorus
ill throw the first punch
because ive kept my mouth shut
for far too long enoughs enough

and you say im wrong but it feels right
and its about damn time
its been too long

enoughs enough
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeverse 2
another time that i get burned
another way that ive been hurt
another year too little pay
another person in my way

another lover says goodbye
another lack of reasons why
another day ill let it slide
another way you try to change my life

prechorus
ill hold it in ill hold it in ill hold it in
forget it now

chorus
ill throw the first punch
because ive kept my mouth shut
for far too long enoughs enough

and you say im wrong but it feels right
and its about damn time
its been too long
enoughs enough
enough
enoughs enough
enoughs enough
breakdown
right between the eyes forget it
right between the eyes forget it

chorus
ill throw the first punch
cause ive kept my mouth shut
for far too long
ill hold it in ill hold it in

and you say im wrong but it feels right
and its about damn time
its been too long
enoughs enough
