what i remember the most
is hollering her name
and the sirens wail as we ran like hell
down a strange trail
oh i wanna know what i did
i wanna know her game
i wanna learn her wits
and how she plays her tricks
oh i gotta know

verse 2
lots of booze and her kiss
these are drugs that do not mix
i was under her spell
and today i feel like hell
she got me going i guess
but who knew love would be like this
dont know what im gonna do
but i guess i gotta see it through

chorus
cause i dont know how to walk out of this deal
the spell she cast on me is real
dont know how to right the wrongs ive done
she bends the wills of men for fun
dont know how to take my own life back
everything she touches turns to black
dont know how to fight what i cant see
that girl has laid a curse on me

i gotta find me a cure
i gotta clear my name
theres gotta be some way
i hope its not too late
to break the spell

yeah
i want to get her alone
i want to ask her why
and look into those eyes
and see the endless night
staring back

verse 3
what kind of magic is this
i was doomed by our first kiss
just a pawn in her game
ive done things that have no name
and shell make me do worse
if the law doesnt get me first
she has turned my heart black
and i know i cant turn back

verse 4
there are runes on my skin
they appear when she walks in
i am bound by her spell
i am chained to do her will
im a goner i guess
who knew love was gonna be like this
she has cloaked me in black
and there aint no turning back
chorus
i dont know how to walk out of this deal
the spell she cast on me is real
i dont know how to right the wrongs ive done
she bends the wills of men for fun
i dont know how to take my own life back
everything she touches turns to black
i dont know how to fight what i cant see
that girl has laid a curse on me
that girl has laid a curse on me7embed"
