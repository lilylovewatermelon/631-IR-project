you seem to replace your brain with your heart
you take things so hard and then you fall apart
you try to explain but before you can start
those cry baby tears come out of the dark

prechorus
someones turning the handle to that faucet in your eyes
you pour it out where everyone can see
your hearts too big for your body its why it wont fit inside
you pour it out where everyone can see

chorus
they call you cry baby cry baby
but you dont fucking care
cry baby cry baby
so you laugh through your tears
cry baby cry baby
cause you dont fucking care
tears fall to the ground
youll just let them drown

postchorus
youll just let them drown
cry baby cry baby
