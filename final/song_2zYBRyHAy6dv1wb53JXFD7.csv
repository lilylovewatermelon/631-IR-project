daddy fell into the sun
cause he’s not with anyone
she came falling to screaming skies
the answers no its just too high

chorus owain
laputa was all we knew and
how we got there how we flew up
heaven’s doors are miles away
cause youre stuck to the ground you have to stay

bridge owain
the robots died in a flash
the robots died of it last

how we got there how we flew up
heavens doors are miles away
