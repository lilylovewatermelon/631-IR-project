okay one take one take

verse 1
this whole worlds always waitin on tomorrow
itchin fiendin for whatever happens next
what if i told you theyre all lying
and i love you for who you are right now the best
everyone thinks theyre going the wrong way
but theyre looking at their maps all wrong
cause everywheres somewhere to someone
and in a rush you cannot dance to smooth slow songs

chorus
so im gonna slow on down someway somehow
today aint different from the rest
and the you that i pine for
oh the you that i need
oh the you of right now is the best

instrumental break

verse 2
this hatin heart healed by the hopeful
and i think i got a song that youll like
its awfully long and such a throatful
but its perfect for a night like tonight
about you on the coastin water
those wild waves crashed cross your skin
one of those days you miss already
and it aint even had the damn chance to end
and i think grandfathers gone crazy
he keeps ramblin on about way back when
braggin bout grandma and war times
all the friends that hes lost once again

so im gonna slow on down someway somehow
today aint different from the rest
oh the you that i pine for
oh the you that i need
oh the you of right now is the bestembed"
