hear the train in the distance
such a lonely sound it makes
when its gone there is silence
you can hear the sound of my heart break
see these arms now theyre empty
because they used to hold on to you
i said id never let go
but somehow you slipped on through
now i know thats how love goes
when love goes away

chorus
im going to cry some
then im going to lay here and die some
all because i know there ain’t no one else
baby if i cant live with you
guess ill have to live with the lonesome

verse 2
theres a prayer that im praying
theres a dream that i always will dream
and the hope keeps me waiting
for the day when you come back to me
its a curse and a blessing
to find love above all the rest
now id rather have nothing
than to settle for less
now i know thats how love goes
when love goes away

then im going to lay here and die some
all because i know there ain’t no one else
