long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when youre a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

chorus
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

verse 2
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and youve got your demons and darling they all look like me

chorus
cause we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

bridge
distance timing
breakdown fighting
silence the train runs off its tracks
kiss me try to fix it
could you just try to listen
hang up give up
and for the life of us we cant get back
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likebreakdown
a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic
beautiful tragic beautiful

chorus
what we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair20embed"
