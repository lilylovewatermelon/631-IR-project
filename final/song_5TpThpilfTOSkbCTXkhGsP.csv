you take what is
and you make it beautiful
when love floods in
were restored forever more

chorus lauren daigle
with breath it brings the dead to life
with words that pierce the dark with light
only by the blood are we set free
with mercy strong to carry shame
and nail it to a tree you alone
hold the power to redeem

verse 2 lauren daigle  all sons  daughters
no guilt competes
with innocence crucified
no grave can hold
what your grace has justified

chorus lauren daigle
with breath it brings the dead to life
with words that pierce the dark with light
only by the blood are we set free
with mercy strong to carry shame
and nail it to a tree you alone
hold the power to redeem
