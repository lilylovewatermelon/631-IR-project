when youre alone
and im alone
i could touch your hair three months ago
but now it makes you so upset

chorus
but you say i dont know how to love
i simply dont understand my life

verse 2
you can say you dont know
but i remember football in the snow
everybodys gone home
why dont you love me anymore

chorus
but you say i dont know how to love
i simply dont understand my life
but you say i dont know how to love
i simply dont understand my life
but you say i dont know how to love
i simply dont understand my lifeyou might also like10embed"
