say it though youre looking down and to the left now
say it like someone who really means it
do it cause if you grow a conscience now
we fall down

verse 2
smiling like theres nothing wrong
youre good at smiling so keep it plastered on
until the morning cause if you shift to genuine
then well fall out
we fall out
and we fall down

chorus
dont say its all for the better
oh i need you to lie to lie to me
ill stand for the greatest pretender
i know you wont die for me
but say you will
just lie to me to me

verse 3
so kiss me and tell me im the one
theres no other no other one you want
baby kiss me make sure you close your eyes
or we fall down
yes we fall down

now i can see you bite your lip when you look at me
one word you say and everything is giving you away
lets close our eyes and save the truth for one more night
or i fall down
