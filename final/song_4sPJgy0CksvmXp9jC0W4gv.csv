the stars will cry
the blackest tears tonight
and this is the moment that i live for
i can smell the ocean air
and here i am
pouring my heart onto these rooftops
just a ghost to the world
thats exactly
exactly what i need

chorus
from up here the city lights burn
like a thousand miles of fire
and im here to sing this anthem
of our dying day

verse 2
for a second i wish the tide
would swallow every inch of this city
as you gasp for air tonight
id scream this song right in your face
if you were here
i swear i wont miss a beat
cause i never
never have before
