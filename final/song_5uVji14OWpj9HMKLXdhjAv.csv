verse 1
her bodys hot
her bodys like the summer
im in a trance or something
her mind is not no
as sharp as all her diamonds
she must be smoking something

prechorus
i see her dancing in the streets
sipping champagne on the beach
so expensive when she eats
cause shes so fancy
i see her when i go to sleep
i check my phone when i am weak
she never posts anything deep
cause shes so fancy

chorus
this summеrs gonna hurt like a motherruhhah ahhah
this summers gonna hurt likе a motherruhhah ahhah

she wants it all
shes always taking something
and now im left with nothing
im ripping off oh
im ripping off that bandage
because i just cant stand it

prechorus
i see her dancing on a fool
like shes seventeen and cool
she really thinks that she can move
but its just nasty
i see her when i go to sleep
i check my phone when i am weak
she never posts anything deep
cause shes so fancy

chorus
