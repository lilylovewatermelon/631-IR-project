when you see them fall down
but you pick em up
you still let them touch the ground
dont worry im sure
theyll know youre trying to help em

verse drake
tryna stay light on my toes
just ran a light in a rolls
told me im lookin exhausted
you hit it right on the nose
im tired of all of these niggas
im tired of all of these hoes
worried bout takin my lane
they aint even got on the road
they turn they back and they leave you
they gon be back when they need you
i practice good over evil
flippin the script like a readthrough
yeah all of my brothers we equal
i play my part too like a sequel
you tell your niggas you got em on anything
question is do they believe you
specially when you never come through
so much hate inside your heart
we dont even know what we done to you
we just know shit gettin run through
never chase it let it come to you
you out here tellin everybody everything
you niggas move like the onetwo yeah

when you see them fall down
but you pick em up
you still let them touch the ground
dont worry i swear
theyll know youre trying to help em
theyll know youre trying to help em
theyll know youre trying to help em
theyll know youre trying to help em
theyll know theyll know

outro drake
