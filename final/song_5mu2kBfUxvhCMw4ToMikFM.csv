have i been to this place before
yeah we danced through the night as the flames burned bright
and the patrons passed out on the floor

whats so new about what youre saying
its a new generation with the same sad song
whats so new about what youre saying
just another generation with the same sad song

the walking dead couldnt tell us any better
its a tale you gotta live to know
yeah the story youre telling is from the book i wrote
ive forgotten more then youll ever know
cause at the end of the day when the hope fades away
it was an outlook you could never afford
youre on one last stand with the boys and the band
before the demon strikes the final chord

whats so new about what youre saying
its a new generation with the same sad song
whats so new about what youre saying
just another generation with the same sad song

youve got tons of fans in hell boy that much i know
tune me up and turn me on before i go
just another sad song
