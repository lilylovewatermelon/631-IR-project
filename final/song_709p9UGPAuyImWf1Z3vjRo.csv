feeling kind of sick tonight
all ive had is coffee and leftover pie
its no wonder why
still you take up all my mind
i dont even think that you care like i do
i should stop
heaven knows ive tried

chorus
one day
i will stop falling in love with you
some day
someone will like me like i like you
until then ill drink my coffee
eat my pie
pretend that we are more than friends
then of course ill let you break my heart again

verse 2
im just tryna understand
what i am to you
more than songs weve exchanged
midnight calls
sunset views
promise i dont mean to cry
but i get overwhelmed and confused
if only you knew
what i felt like
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
one day
i will stop falling in love with you
some day
someone will like me like i like you
until then ill drink my coffee
eat my pie
pretend that we are more than friends
then of course ill let you break my heart again

outro
some day
one day
i will stop falling in love with you
until i do
ill be thinking of you
let you break my heart again15embed"
