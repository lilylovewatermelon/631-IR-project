graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
a constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
the lessons that you taught me i learned were never true

prechorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again

chorus chester bennington
i wanna run away never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind

verse 2 chester bennington
paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
another wave of tension has more than filled me up
all my talk of taking action these words were never true

prechorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again
