drown my sorrows in this bottle
wont like wakin up tomorrow
im the only one that cares about myself
and you dont need me like i need you
so if i go maybe ill free you
but ill be lost to tell the truth i need your help
and even you cant fix my problems
like you once did im too hollow
i cant talk to you no more and i cant tell
if its me or if its you cause
you dont even pick up my calls no more
im drunk and left alone with all my thoughts

chorus
so maybe maybe im drivin me crazy
maybe its me and its not you
im not too good at admitting when i fuck up
but maybe maybe its you who can save me
i got love for you but i hate me
so maybe theres no way to change me
so maybe maybe im drivin me crazy
maybe its me and its not you
im not too good at admitting when i fuck up
but maybe maybe its you who could save me
i got love for you but i hate me
so maybe theres no way to change me yeah

no way that ill ever change
so im down to lay down next to my brain
i said im okay but no way
its more than i can take
and theres no one to blame but me
no need to wait for me
why do you pick me up just to break me
thats what you say to me
why do you play with me
you wont ever understand

chorus
so maybe maybe im drivin me crazy
maybe its me and its not you
im not too good at admitting when i fuck up
but maybe maybe its you who can save me
i got love for you but i hate me
so maybe theres no way to change me
so maybe maybe im drivin me crazy
maybe its me and its not you
im not too good at admitting when i fuck up
but maybe maybe its you who could save me
i got love for you but i hate me
so maybe theres no way to change me24embed"
