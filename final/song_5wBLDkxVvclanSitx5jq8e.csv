verse 1 johnny 3 tears
look up and see that motherfucking writing on the wall
when you see j3t thirty deep hes down to brawl
fuck the haters i see cause i hate that you breathe
i see you duck you little punk you little fucking disease
i got hu tatted on the front of my arms
the boulevard brass knuckles in the back of the car
cause we drunkdrive cadillacs we never go far
but when you see us motherfuckers better know who we are
i got one thing to say to punkasses who hate
motherfuckers dont know but you better watch what you say
from these industry fucks to these faggotass punks

im already loud maybe its a little too late
johnnys taking heads off of all faggots who hate

verse 2 charlie scene
im getting used to this nuisance of fags who badmouth this music
how fucking stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
you cowards cant you never will dont even try to pursue it
i took the chance i paid the bill i nearly died for this music
you make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
youre tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this bitch
how ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this
you need to slit your wrists get pissed and go jump off a bridge
what you cant see the sarcasm in the verses i spit
what you think i just got lucky didnt work for this shit
bitch ive been working at this ever since i was a kid
ive played a million empty shows to only family and friends
what kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big
id hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
that shits as worse as it gets this verse is over i quit
signed charlie scene on your girlfriends tits

verse 3 jdog
white boys with tattoos ppointing right at you
were breaking everything rrowdy like a classroom
pack of wolves cause we dont follow the rules
and when youre running your mouth our razor blades come out
because theres nothing in my life except my dick and what i spit
so my dick is in my hand when i respond to faggots talking shit
speaking of fag already rapped with the drag
we killed him then we stuffed his body in the cadillac
bbut you always press and you know i never stress
with loki dms jjohnny to my left
got phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
i grew up on drivebys and la gang signs
so what the fuck you know about being a gangster
and what the fuck you know about being in danger
you aint doing this so you know youre just talking shit
mad at all of us cause every song is a fucking hit
