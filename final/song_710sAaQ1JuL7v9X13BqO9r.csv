verse 1
ive been sizin you up and stuff
watchin you live life large
big enough for the both of us to big up the love
got the measure of the man in you
its more than the sum of the parts
its true what they say
you gotta big up the love
i was checkin nice things you do
standing in the starbucks queue
you buy coffee for a stranger whos down on their luck
random acts of kindness flow flow
compassion from a hand id like to hold hold
it does it for me and i cant get enough

prechorus
oh dont confuse me when i say
oh please dont take this the wrong way
you can lead a heart to love
but you cant make it fall
im tired of loving small

verse 2
most blokes too shallow to swim in
only interested in one thing
its all so meaningless
cause puddles dry up yeah up
a view of the world so small it limits
it limits the size of the dream and you achieving it
a new panorama a new panorama with your arms around me
i see my life how it should be
