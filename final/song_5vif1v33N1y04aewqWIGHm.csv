verse 1
no one gets left behind another fallen soul
no one gets left behind another broken home
no one gets left behind we stand and fight together
no one gets left behind or we all die alone

prechorus
politicians bathing in their greed
no idea on how to be all they can be

chorus
have you no honor have you no soul
what is it theyre dying for do you really even know
have you no backbone have you no spine
what ever happened to no one gets left behind

verse 2
no one gets left behind i know you made it up
no one gets left behind its more for money
no one gets left behind drink from the golden cup
no one gets left behind your time is coming

prechorus
play your war games with other peoples lives
it should be you on the frontline

have you no honor have you no soul
what is it theyre dying for do you really even know
have you no backbone have you no spine
what ever happened to no one gets left behind
