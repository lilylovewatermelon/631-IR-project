someday theyll find your small town world on a big town avenue
gonna make you like the way they talk when theyre talkin to you
gonna make you break out of your shell cause they tell you to
gonna make you like the way they lie better than the truth

prechorus 1
theyll tell you everything you wanted someone else to say
theyre gonna break your heart yeah

chorus
from what ive seen
youre just one more hand me down
cause no ones tried to give you what you need
so lay all your troubles down
i am with you now

verse 2
somebody oughta take you in try to make you love again
try to make you like the way they feel when theyre under your skin
never once do you think that they would lie when theyre holdin you
then you wonder why they havent called when they said theyd call you

prechorus 2
youll start to wonder if youre ever gonna make it by
youll start to think you were born blind
