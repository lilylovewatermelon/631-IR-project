verse 1 nicole scherzinger
typical aint hardly the type i fall for
i like when the physical
dont leave me asking for more
im a sexy mama mama
who knows just how to get what i wanna wanna
what i wanna do is spring this on ya on ya
back up all of the things that i told ya told ya told ya told ya
you been sayin all the right things all night long
but i cant seem to get you over here to help take this off

verse 2 nicole scherzinger
you say youre a big boy but i cant agree
cause the love you said you had aint been put on me
i wonder wonder if im just too much for you
wonder wonder if my kiss dont make you just
wonder wonder what i got next for you
what you wanna do do
take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
i can see just like most guys that your game dont please
