leave them lights as they are
and keep your clothes on
ive had more than my fill
of whiskey and women
and goodhearted villains
but theres a wickedness in me still

keep that gun locked away
locked away boy
well you know youre an angry young man
going in town with six rounds
youre sure to be hellbound
that house youve got is built on the sand

chorus
ive been living on the sand
dont take much to guide my hand
far from promised land
on the sand

bridge
dont look twice look twice at that bottle
youll claim that jesus turned the water to wine
youll be wishing that wine you were drinking was water
when youre jumping the bridge in the night

forgive me forgive me
dont it sound more clear
when im screaming it day after day
ive lost all my patience
im wasted on waiting on
making my next mistake

chorus
ive been living on the sand
dont take much to guide my hand
far from promised land
on the sand
ive been living on the sand
dont take much to guide my hand
far from promise land
on the sandembed"
