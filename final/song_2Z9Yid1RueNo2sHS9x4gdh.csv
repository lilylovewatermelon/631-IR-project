mama
i understand your many sleepless nights
when you sit and you think about father
or how you tried to be the perfect wife

prechorus
you used to dress and fix your hair
when you smiled through your tears
in the mirror you would stare
and say a prayer
like i wish he said im beautiful
i wish it didnt hurt at all
i dont know how i got here
i was once the one who had his heart

chorus
until you had enough then you took that ring off
you took that ring off
so tired of the lies and tryin fightin cryin
took that ring off
oh now the fun begins
dust yourself off and you love again
you found a new man now you shine and youre fine
like its my time you took that ring off woo
