like lightning it lept forth half startled at itself
its feet upon the ashes and the rags its hands tight to the throats
        of kings

o hope and faith
o aching close of exiled patriots lives
o many a sickend heart
turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh

and you paid to defile the people—you liars mark
not for numberless agonies murders lusts
for court thieving in its manifold mean forms worming from his
        simplicity the poor mans wages
for many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laughd at in
        the breaking

then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge
        or the heads of the nobles fall
the people scornd the ferocity of kings

but the sweetness of mercy brewd bitter destruction and the
        frightend monarchs come back
each comes in state with his train hangman priest taxgatherer
soldier lawyer lord jailer and sycophant
yet behind all lowering stealing lo a shape
vague as the night draped interminably head front and form in
        scarlet folds
whose face and eyes none may see
out of its robes only this the red robes lifted by the arm
one finger crookd pointed high over the top like the head of a
        snake appears

meanwhile corpses lie in newmade graves bloody corpses of young men
the rope of the gibbet hangs heavily the bullets of princes are
        flying the creatures of power laugh aloud
and all these things bear fruits and they are good

those corpses of young men
those martyrs that hang from the gibbets those hearts piercd by
        the gray lead
cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughterd vitality

they live in other young men o kings
they live in brothers again ready to defy you
they were purified by death they were taught and exalted

not a grave of the murderd for freedom but grows seed for freedom
        in its turn to bear seed
which the winds carry afar and resow and the rains and the snows nourish
not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose
but it stalks invisibly over the earth whispering counseling cautioning
liberty let others despair of you—i never despair of you

is the house shut is the master away
nevertheless be ready be not weary of watching
he will soon return his messengers come anonembed"
