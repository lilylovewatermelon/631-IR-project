verse 1
uh i got a pocket full of posies
some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin like he know me
im psychopathic lowkey my hyperactive dome piece
get no sleep ill as fuck the hospitals seem so weak
i stood before an angel as he told me bout the glory
put me in a room of people how the fuck could i be lonely
i only get money these labels tryna clone me
uh my thoughts get heavy hit the ground and crack the concrete
so i try to keep em in my head
its sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
word to heavy d and rest in peace to all that come and pass
life is good sometimes but it just doesnt last
a bunch of stress you see this mic is like my punchin bag
rock n roll drugs and cash you softer than a bubble bath
sucka ass mafucka mafuckas sediment
doper than the shit that killed chris tucker in dead presidents
desert rhymes homie ridin beats im on a camel
im way too hot to handle life a beach i brought my sandals heh
you want a war i got a lot of ammo
you aint a soldier cause you rockin camo
young rambo hundred million fans though
and i do it big you a ipod nano
fire on wax look like i brought candles
yeah you got a show but you aint on my channel
you might also likeinterlude

ahahaha im gonna fucking kill you
uh
imax some shit motherfucker yeah suck my dick

verse 2
hey
ayo im bout to start gamblin with ambien im dutch smokin
thats a strike but fuck bowlin i could tear a pin of maryland
see im american apparently its damagin
to be in front of cameras in your underwear with marilyn
monroelookin dumb hoes who want too much dough
and come close to have you straight trippin when you jump rope
dont rock the love boat this business fuckin cutthroat
and its gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
rooms filled with blunt smoke peep me through the fog
these rappers who be hatin probably need to get a job
see me im with my squad gettin money livin comfortable
i know a couple hoes who model but they ugly though
fuck a toast yall is fuckin broke cut ya throat
judgin me is nothin dope boy you lyin under oath
god made the world why did man make the scriptures
and if he created lennon whyd he go and make a hitler
i could take a photo but id rather paint a picture
of the one laurence fishburne well shoot up all you hipsters
im from pittsburgh thats black and gold
if my skin gets filled up ima tat my soul
runnin out of paper writin on my hand
hundred thousand haters writin bout my jams
want a number one independent album im your man
ima hit preme and leave you all right where you stand
