guess you never really know just what youve got
till you finally realize she could be gone
i know that ive been taking you for granted
for the longest time
all you wanted was someone who really cares
and i didnt even notice you were there
i promise that ill never ever make that same mistake
not twice

chorus
that was thenthis is now
took some time to come around
all i wanna do
is try againshow you how
i know that its all about
giving attention to you
i was a fool for way to long
what you wanted but could not see
that was then this is now
took some time to figure out
love is all you need

verse 2
guess i never thought about it before
i was thinking of myself and nothing more
didnt even wanna try to find out
how you really feel
now i see that im the lucky one its true
and what weve got you know i never want to lose
i was trippin in a fantasy
and missing what was real

verse 3
i used to be someone
who only really thought about themselves
and no one else and you could tell baby
but thats before i understood
that when youve got something this good
gotta let her know
and i want you to know

bridge
youre always my priority
and i wanna give more that all the love you need
took a little time
but now you know i finally see
that youre my world
i never want our love to fade ready willing
and im gonna do whatever it takes
no im never gonna let it slip away
cause youre my girl
