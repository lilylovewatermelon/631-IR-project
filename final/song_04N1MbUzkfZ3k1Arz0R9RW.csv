boy a fool wonder whats cool
tryin to figure out what to rhyme about
i heard your mans ran cryin to his mommy and his daddy
when the cops drove by his house so who you tryin to dial
if you lookin for a answer you probably gon find it now
and to the man in the hat standin lookin at his watch
motherfucker well the time is now
go and clap your hands let me hear you say thats the jam
see i wouldnt be shit if i aint have no fans
cant sit down kids you have to stand
just put your hands up you dont have to dance
here we get it poppin like its pakistan
iraq iran i have them sayin macs the man
the maximum comin through to pass you bums
so if you aint got no money better ask for some
hey we came to get down have a good time
bring the champagne out and the good wine
we gon be sippin and whippin the sickest whips
spittin the illest shit thats sicker than syphilis
comin in the back door yellin fuck a list
fans takin pictures while im tryin to take a piss
we came to party didnt come to give a shit
now sing this part it goes like this hey

chorus
all my people in the front
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
everybody in the back
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
if youre feelin that funk
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
if you like it like that
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
all my people in the front front
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
everybody in the back back
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
if youre feelin that funk funk
go and clap your hands go clap your hands
if you like it like that that
