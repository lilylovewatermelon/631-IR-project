if i show you
get to know you
if i hold you just for today
im not gonna wanna let go
im not gonna wanna go home
tell me you feel the same

chorus
cause im for real are you for real
i cant help myself its the way i feel
when you look me in the eyes like you did last night
i cant stand to hear you say goodbye
well it feels so right cause it feels so right
just to have you standing by my side
so dont let me go cause you have my soul
and i just wanted you to know

verse 2
i dont wanna look back
cause i know that we have
something the past could never change
and now im stuck in the moment
and my heart is open
tell me that you feel the same oh
