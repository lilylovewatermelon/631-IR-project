calling out your name
i cant stop myself from falling
falling back again
in the morning
baby in the afternoon

dark like the shady corners
inside a violin
hot like to burn my lips
i know i cant win
in the morning
baby in the afternoon

i tried to quit you but im too weak
waking up without you i can hardly speak at all

my girlfriend tried to help me
get you off my mind
she tried a little tea and sympathy
to get me to unwind
in the morning
baby in the afternoon

funny how my favorite shirt
smells more like you than me
bitter traces left behind
in stains that no one can see
in the morning
baby in the afternoon
see norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeyoure gonna put me in an early grave
i know im your slave whenever you call

i cant stop myself from calling
calling out your name
i can stop myself from falling
falling back again
falling back again
falling back again
falling back again
falling back again
in the morning falling back again
falling back again
baby in the afternoon falling back again
falling back again
in the morning1embed"
