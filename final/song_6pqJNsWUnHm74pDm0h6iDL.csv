let em have their time
sit back and let em shine
let em rise and rise
cause one day theyre gonna fall
let em soak in the sun
sit back and let em have their fun
let em spill their guts
cause one day theyre gonna slip on em

chorus
well i could be angry but youre not worth the fight
and besides im moving on
ive counted to ten and now im feeling alright
and besides im moving on

verse 2
let em play their songs
let em say whats right and wrong
let em do their thing
cause theyll never be you and me
weve got our own style
weve got a way of living life
if they cant get down
well we dont need them around
