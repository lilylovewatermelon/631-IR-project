they told me once nothing grows
when a house aint a home
is it true honestly
when its all a part of me
a couple years of waiting rooms
finding god and lose him too
wanna scream but whats the use

prechorus
lyin awake and i stare at the door
i just cant take it no more
they told me its useless theres no hope in store
but somehow i just want you more

chorus
i want you more
somehow i just want you more
i want you more
somehow i just want you more

verse 2
wooden floors and little feet
a flower bud in concrete
feelin so incomplete
wonder will we ever meet
and would you know it right away
how hard i tried to see your face
a little screen a photograph mine to take
you might also likeprechorus
i sit and i stare at your clothes in the drawer
i cry and my knuckles get sore
cause i still believe it wont be like before
and now somehow i just want you more

chorus
i want you more
somehow i just want you more
i want you more
somehow i just want you more

bridge
and when you decide its your time to arrive
ive loved you for all of my life
and nothing could stop me from giving a try
ive loved you for all of my life

chorus
loved you more
somehow i still love you more
love you more
somehow i still love you more

outro
loved you more
somehow i still love you more
love you more
somehow i still love you more25embed"
