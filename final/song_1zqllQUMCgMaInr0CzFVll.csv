i didnt hear what you were sayin
i live on raw emotion baby
i answer questions never maybe
and im not kind if you betray me
so who the hell are you to say we
never would have made it babe

prechorus
if you needed love well then ask for love
could have given love now i’m taking love
and it’s not my fault cause you both deserve
whats coming now so don’t say a word

chorus
wake up call
caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
dont you care about me anymore
don’t you care about me i dont think so
six foot tall
came without a warning so i had to shoot him dead
he wont come around here anymore
come around here i dont think so

verse 2
would have bled to make you happy
you didnt need to treat me that way
and now you beat me at my own game
and now i find you sleeping soundly
and your lovers screaming loudly
hear a sound and hit the ground
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeprechorus
if you needed love well then ask for love
could have given love now i’m taking love
and it’s not my fault cause you both deserve
whats coming now so don’t say a word

chorus
