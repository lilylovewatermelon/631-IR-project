i thought she was happy but i was wrong
the note she left it took me by surprise
said ive turned into some other guy
the things she said that she gave up for me
she says it was a waste of her time
guess i dont really know what i was thinking
wouldve thought we would float but we kept sinking in
things were so good
you were in love with some other guy
he looked just like me but i make you cry
you know i dont mean to
just an asshole sometimes
i never saw myself as being alone
and maybe that was my problem
cuz now shes gone
and i cant help but think of how things could be
and i hope shes happy happy with out me
and all the things that she gave up for me
i took for granted time after time
guess i dont really know what i was thinking
wouldve thought we would float but we kept sinking in
things were so good
you were in love with some other guy
he looked just like me but i make you cry
you know i dont mean to
just an asshole sometimes
and please dont think im complaining
i was just happy to have her for a time
and if you see her tell her i said
hello and that im doing just fine
guess i dont really know what i was thinking
wouldve thought we would float but we kept sinking in
things were so good
you were in love with some other guy
he looked just like me but i make you cry
you know i dont mean to
you know i dont mean to
just an asshole sometimes
guess i dont really know
just an asshole sometimes
guess i dont really know
just an asshole sometimes
guess i dont really know
just an asshole sometimes
