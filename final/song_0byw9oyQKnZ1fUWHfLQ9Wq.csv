when you walk in the room
in a white bodysuit
and i say take it off
so you tell me to watch

chorus
when its pure
only your love could get me to fall
when its deep gets so hot
and its so beautiful

verse 2
and the tv is on
when we make love because
we get carried away
we dont care anyway

chorus
when its pure
only your love could get me to fall
when its deep gets so hot
and its so beautiful

verse 3
wrapped your hair in a towel
but i watch you let it down
and its all soaking wet
as you take me in your mouth
and we stare at the street
from the back balcony
but now all i can see
is you undressing for me
you might also likechorus
when its pure
only your love could get me to fall
when its deep gets so hot
and its so beautifulembed"
