just walked down the street to the coffee shop
had to take a break
ive been by her side for eighteen hours straight
saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
pushing up through the concrete
like it was planted right there for me to see

the flashing lights
the honking horns
all seem to fade away
but in the shadow of the hospital
at 508
i saw god today

chorus
ive been to church
ive read the book
i know hes there
but i dont look
near as often as i should

his fingerprints are everywhere
i just look down and stop and stare
open my eyes and then i swear
i saw god today
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
saw a couple walking by
they were holding hands
and she had that glow
yeah i couldnt help
but i noticed that she was starting to show
stood there for a minute
taking in the sky
lost in that sunset
a splash of amber melting into shades of red

chorus
ive been to church
ive read the book
i know hes there
but i dont look
near as often as i should

verse 3
got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
shes sleeping like a rock
my name on her wrist
wearing tiny pink socks
shes got my nose
shes got her mamas eyes
my brand new baby girl
shes a miracle
i saw god today2embed"
