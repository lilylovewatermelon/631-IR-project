i once knew a girl in the years of my youth
with eyes like the summer all beauty and truth
but in the morning i fled left a note and it read
someday you will be loved

verse 2
i cannot pretend that i felt any regret
cause each broken heart will eventually mend
and as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
someday you will be loved

chorus
youll be loved youll be loved like you never have known
and the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
just a series of blurs like i never occurred
cause someday you will be loved

verse 3
you may feel alone when youre falling asleep
and every time tears roll down your cheeks
but i know your heart belongs to someone youve yet to meet
and someday you will be loved

chorus
youll be loved youll be loved like you never have known
and the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
just a series of blurs like i never occurred
but someday you will be loved
