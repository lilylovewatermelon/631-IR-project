well they say you live and learn but it really seems more to me
like all along ive been learning how to live
well for years ive been drifting like a boat lost out at sea
ive been out walking them ties on the railroad of sin

verse 2
well looking back on my life now at some of the things i done
makes me wanna hang my head in shame
i was a nogood noaccount lowdown heartbreaker
on that railroad of sin i was a highballing train

chorus
im just a poor boy had to beg steal and borrow
just a leaf blowing lonesome in the wind
im just a hitchhiker on that old highway of sorrow
just a highballing train on the railroad of sin

solo
woo

verse 2
well you wont feel it and you wont hear it coming
well cause when shes rolling slow it dont make a sound
but i got that throttle to ten on the railroad of sin
going off of the rails and i cant slow it down
