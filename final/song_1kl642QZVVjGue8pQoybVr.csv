verse 1 the game
yeah they say sleep is the cousin of death guess we related
cause i’m the most slept on and the most hated
hated hated by niggas with no hustle
staring at me in the club like i wont bust you
in the face with this spades life is a card game
and im playing spades gambling with yall change
fucking basketball wives while you at away games
really fucking basketball wives aint gotta say names
whole body tatted like a new york city freight train
niggas get to barking put a bullet in the great dane
try me end up like why me
team full of animals like i coach the heat
four floor mansion close to the beach
six car garage thats how im supposed to eat
in miami rolling up kush on boat decks
flagging down the waitress waving my rolex

verse 2 busta rhymes
yo i done survive the test of time doing this shit so long
and only rest to rise again homie i sleep when im gone
look a legend while im prime so current and they hate this
the streets classified me as another level of greatness
i dont fight for crowns at all i let wack niggas bitch
and let em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
listen see i dont waste time debating over them things
because im god motherfucker god create kings bust it
im hearing that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
piano sounding beautiful and sad at the same time
the feeling at a funeral so study you niggas
khaled provide the theme music while i bury you niggas
see now theres no escaping the god you better find a getaway
fore i start wiling like haitians and jamaicans when its labor day
khaled every time you know we gotta make em love it
realize that everything is hotter when we touch it

verse 3 the game
ayo khaled let this shit breathe
spoiled little rich nigga thats me
smoke coming out the sunroof blowing on hashish
cant stop now cause im in too deep
one point five wired every two weeks
niggas wanna kill me let the shells fall out
life insurance and plates my kids gon ball out
they kids gon ball out twenty years from now pulling cars out
you gon think cocaine getting hauled out x getting shipped in
crystal meth getting dipped in all cause you let a nigga slip in
aftermath 05 gunit 06
everything else is gymnastics watch the dough flip
sitting on the couch smoking up memories
pouring jack daniels toast to my enemies
fuck beef nigga i aint got the energy
take the last shot to the dome john kennedy
chorus ceelo green  ester dean
im counting my time cause my time is my money yeah
the sun goes down but i wont stop for nothing yeah
why close my eyes id rather sleep when im gone
