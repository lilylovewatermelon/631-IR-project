i got your picture im coming with you dear maria count me in
theres a story at the bottom of this bottle and im the pen

verse 1
when the lights go off i want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
the way you wrap those boys around your finger
go on and play the leader cause you know its what youre good at
the low road for the fast track make every second last

chorus
cause i got your picture im coming with you dear maria count me in
theres a story at the bottom of this bottle and im the pen
make it count when im the one whos selling you out
cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

verse 2
live and let live youll be the showgirl of the home team
ill be the narrator telling another tale of the american dream
i see your name in lights we can make you a star
girl well take the world by storm it isnt that hard

chorus
cause i got your picture im coming with you dear maria count me in
theres a story at the bottom of this bottle and im the pen
make it count when im the one whos selling you out

watching from the floor
take a breath and let the rest come easy
never settle down cause the cash flow leaves me
always wanting more
