a woman is mystery
a man just cant understand
sometimes all it takes to please her
is the touch of your hand
and other times you got to take it slow
and hold her all night long
heaven knows theres so many ways
a man can go wrong

chorus
must be doing something right
i just heard you sigh
you leaned into my kiss
and closed those deep blue need you eyes
dont know what i did
to earn a love like this but baby i
must be doing something right

verse 2
anywhere you want to go
baby show me the way
im open to suggestions
mmm whatever you say
tonights about giving you
what you want whatever it takes

and judging by the smile on your face
