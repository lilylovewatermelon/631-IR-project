my words cut just like razor blades
and im just like a hand grenade
you pulled the pin now youre too late
excuse me while i detonate
you live the life of luxury
deep down inside your misery
subsides and thrives for company
now morally youre crumbling

chorus
goddamn need some help i cant help myself
cause my girlfriends in love with someone else
goddamn its too bad really wished it would last
always wanting what ill never have so goddamn

verse 2
my nerves are right on edge today
and i just might cave in and break
i must forgive i hesitate
excuse me while i separate
you lived the life and lied to me
i gave you almost everything
i wore my heart upon my sleeve
i gave you almost all of me

cause my girlfriends in love with someone else
goddamn its too bad really wished it would last
always wanting what ill never have so goddamn
