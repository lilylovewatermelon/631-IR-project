or release the keys to the shackles on her wrist
she can tackle some of this smack on smack on some of this
dick tracy arrest her book her fingerprint your hooker
you took her to the club and now her bodys full of liquor

shes a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things

verse 2 big boi
oh oh lord lord how can it be so hard
to put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
i got to start by complimenting you on your physique
you unique you best believe im gon skeet once i speak
spoke spit spatter spat and i macked her just like that
but it takes years of perseverance and experience to get the cat
so why dont i chase this hennessy down with some of that
on your back like a cheerleader missing the final stack
as we strut skip the line
through the glass window glance we look fine
right on time as we step in the place
the nurserys crunk weve come to play
verse 3 sleepy brown
everybodys watching cause them furs just hit the door
while the gators creeping crawling oh so wicked across that floor
to the vip where we proceed to give you what you need
throw your hands up if you feel me throw your hands up if you feel me
cause we well designed bowtie like the finest wines bowtie
feel good to be fly bowtie so dont you ask me why bowtie
i got the ladies in line bowtie because they cant deny bowtie
so raise your hands to the sky bowtie cause we super fly cause we super fly bowtie
