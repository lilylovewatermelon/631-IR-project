northside shawty pull up in a droptop
3 am with the night backdrop
poppin on pills like i pop cough drops
multimillionaire all from my laptop
slob on my knob until your jaw lock
came a long way from rocks in my sock
moonwalk on the block while im sipping on wock
took a whole year off and we still on top
still the same boy that came from jeffer street from jeffer street
still the best friend that the devil keep that the devil keep
always burning up triple six degrees triple six degrees
lock scarecrow in hell and throw away the key yeah

chorus 40 blunts 40 blunts  lil cig
as the years go by
another day closer to death
time is ticking hurry
as the years go by
another day closer to death
time is ticking hurry
as the years go by
another day closer to death
time is ticking hurry
as the years go by
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 40 blunts
all the things that you were gonna do you never did em
now youre wondering how come they never listen whenever youre talking
look who the fuck just walked in
time to clear the air fuck that ill be coughing til my coffin
and in my coffin i wont toss and turn
instead ill rest ive earned some sleep
let me dream of sheep release me into the deep
cover up my head with the sheet
as the years go by
the same fuck girls will be fucking the same fuck boys
as the years go by
the same hero you once had has been reduced to a toy
as the years go by
the drugs used to be fun now theyve become a problem
as the years go by
before your life even begun now its coming undone
