one more night one more down
one more one more round
first one in last one out
giving this town lots to talk about
they dont know what they dont know

chorus
people say i got a drinkin problem
that aint no reason to stop
people saying that ive hit rock bottom
just cause im living on the rocks
its a broken hearted thinkin problem
so pull another bottle off the wall
people say i got a drinkin problem
but i got no problem drinkin at all

postchorus
they keep on talking
drawing conclusions
they call it a problem
i call it a solution

verse 2
last call gets later and later
i come in here so i dont have to hate her
same old folks same old songs
the same old same old blue neon
the same old buzz just because
