i cant believe hes gone
whyd you leave
sometimes it hurts so bad

verse 1
hes the kind of guy that runs the street
but he treats me good
and he makes his dough illegally
thats how hes taking care of me
and i respect the fact that hes chosen that life
but it keeps me up late at night
and i just cant spend my time
wondering where hes at is he okay
wanna be by his side
but i commit a crime bonnie to his clyde
and i dont wanna live that way

chorus
i love my baby so
but hes not here no more no more
hard for me to understand understand
so i wrote him this song wrote him this song
when i look him in his eyes
knew i couldnt change his mind
so i wrote this melody
and im saying sweet goodbye

though he promised that
he could never put me in harms way
that it is something that he cant control
cause the game remains the same
and now he says he wants out of it
but hes in too deep
and the only way that he would go
is killing him or leaving me
so this is where im at and it hurts so bad
that i had to choose
if i wanna live or die with you oh baby

chorus
i love my baby so
but hes not here no more not here babe
hard for me to understand
so i wrote him this song i wrote you this song
when i look him in his eyes

and im saying sweet goodbye yeah yeah

but hes not here no more why did you go

when i look him in his eyes

and im saying sweet goodbye
bridge
i tried to give him hope
and promised him my life
but i dont know
what made him want to leave this life
and as he went away
a tear fell from my eye
and theres no turning back
theres only goodbye

chorus
