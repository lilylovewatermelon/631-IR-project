get back on track pick me up some bottles of booze
fickle freshman probably thinks shes cooler than you
a hay ride at 5 everybodys coming around
so go press your skirt word is theres a new girl in town
i call shotgun you can play your rb tunes
the fellowship time it always comes a little too soon
the land of the creeps freshened up from babyfaced shave
put your eyes on me and i know a place where we can get away

chorus
just say i want you
just xactly like i used to
cause baby this is only bringing me down

verse 2
homeboys so proud he finally got the video proof
the night vision shows she was only ducking the truth
its heavy i know the black cat with the gift down below
a choke and a gag she spit up and came back for more

chorus
she said i want you
just xactly like i used to
and baby this is only bringing me down
she said i want you
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
i want you
just xactly like i used to
and baby this is only bringing me down
i said i want you
just xactly like i used to
and baby this is only bringing me down10embed"
