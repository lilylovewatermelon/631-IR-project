you have brought me to the water
where my past can be swept away
in the current of your mercy
and i know iâ€™ll never be the same
theres no limit to your promise
jesus you have done it all for me

where my soul can be satisfied
and your love is overflowing
from within me and it wont run dry
theres no limit to your promise
