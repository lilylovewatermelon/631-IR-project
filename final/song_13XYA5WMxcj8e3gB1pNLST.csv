verse 1
you are so sweet
dancing to the beat
theres a meat market down the street
the boys and the girls watch each other eat
you are so sweet so sweet
dancing and moving to that beat that beat
theres a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
the boys and the girls watch each other eat
when they really just wanna watch each other

chorus
sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep
sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep

postchorus
you are so sweet once more
you are so sweet solo

bridge
i went walking through the city
like a drunk but not
with my slip showing a little
like a drunk but not
and i am one of your people
but the cars dont stop
and i am one of your people
but the cars dont stop
and its been a long time since before ive been touched
now im getting touched all the time
and its only a matter of whom
and its only a matter of when
an addiction to hands and feet
theres a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
when they really just wanna watch each other sleep
an addiction to hands and feet
theres a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
when they really just want to watch each other

chorus
sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep
sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep
they want to watch to watch each other
sleep sleep sleep3embed"
