but something keeps me really quiet im alive im a lush

his parliaments on fire and his hands are up
on the balcony and im singing

verse 2
down on the west coast they got their icons
their silver starlets their queens of saigons
and youve got the music
youve got the music in you dont you
down on the west coast they love their movies
their golden gods and rock n roll groupies
and youve got the music
youve got the music in you dont you

prechorus
you push it hard i pull away im feeling hotter than fire
i guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
te deseo cariño boy its you i desire
your love your love my love

chorus
i can see my baby swinging
his parliaments on fire and his hands are up
on the balcony and im singing
ooh baby ooh baby im in love
i can see my sweet boy swaying
hes crazy y cubano como yo lala
on the balcony and im saying
move baby move baby im in love
i can see my baby swinging
his parliaments on fire and his hands are up
on the balcony and im singing
ooh baby ooh baby im in love
i can see my sweet boy swaying
hes crazy y cubano como yo lala
