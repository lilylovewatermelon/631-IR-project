i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
i remember when your head caught flame
well you laughed baby its okay
its buzzcut season anyway
well you laughed baby its okay

prechorus
explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

verse 2
we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how were living
we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot sweet taste
shut my eyes to the song that plays

prechorus
the men up on the news
they try to tell us all that we will lose
but its so easy in this blue
where everything is good
you might also likechorus
and ill never go home again
place the call feel it start
favourite friend
and nothings wrong when nothings true
i live in a hologram with you
were all the things that we do for fun
and ill breathe and it goes
play along
makebelieve its hyper real
but i live in a hologram with you

bridge
cola with the burntout taste
im the one you tell your fears to
therell never be enough of us

prechorus
explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

chorus
and ill never go home again
place the call feel it start
favourite friend
and nothings wrong when nothings true
i live in a hologram with you
were all the things that we do for fun
and ill breathe and it goes
play along
makebelieve its hyper real
but i live in a hologram with you
