born to run on the radio
doin 95 down rock springs road
racin the tennessee sun

we stuck it on the hometown games
and played chicken with midnight trains
oh time is slow
we were insane
rebels on the run

and we made a beer bottle pact
behind burleys store
that we would always be one for all
and all for one

rebels on the run

heather reed was our sheriffs kid
it was me and her and a half pint of gin
went further than wed ever been
right there in my shotgun

i was country boy
she was country club
her momma said id never measure up
we left that town in a trail of dust
like rebels on the run
you might also likewe made a class ring pact in a motel 6
that we were gonna stay in that crazy love
and be forever young

rebels on the run

now billy joe sells atvs
old ace wound up marrying heather reed
and every now and then they give me a ring
and ask me if im ever gonna grow up

no im a rolling stone and a ramblin man
on the road with some boys in a band
aint nothin out there id rather be than a
rebel on the run

we made a beer bottle pact
behind burleys store
that we would always be one for all
and all for one

rebels on the run
rebels on the runembed"
