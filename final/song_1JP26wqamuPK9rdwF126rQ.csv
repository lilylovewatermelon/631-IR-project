ooh ooh

verse 1
its been years since anyone could be a friend
its the fear that kills the feeling in the end
can we face it can we shape it can we really die
if rain is what you want all you have to do is close your eyes
just close your eyes

verse 2
i am watching resurrections start to crawl
is there any chance in hell any chance at all
do we need it do we see it is it really there
if rain is what you want then take your seats enjoy the fall
enjoy the fall

chorus
the only thing deeper than my last breath
the only thing darker than my last death
is the panic the static ive come back from the dead
but my cities will never sleep again

bridge
in these diamonds were left with colored glass
as pressure takes its toll we will outlast
but you cant break my heart
as long as i can be myself ill never fall apart
and you cant take me in
if im not broken break me down
so i will never feel alone again
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
the only thing deeper than my last breath
the only thing darker than my last death
is the panic the static ive come back from the dead
but my cities will never sleep again

outro
my cities will never sleep again
my cities will never sleep again
my cities will never sleep again
my cities will never sleep again23embed"
