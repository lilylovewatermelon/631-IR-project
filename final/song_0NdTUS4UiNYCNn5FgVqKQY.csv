whats been happenin in your world
what have you been up to
i heard that you fell in love or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth yeah

chorus
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it snap out of it
i get the feelin i left it too late but baby
snap out of it snap out of it
if that watch dont continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies havin a sing
ill be here waitin ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

verse 2
forever isnt for everyone
is forever for you
it sounds like settlin down or givin up
but it dont sound much like you girl

chorus
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it snap out of it
i get the feelin i left it too late but baby
snap out of it snap out of it
if that watch dont continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies havin a sing
ill be here waitin ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

under a spell youre hypnotised ooh

chorus
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it snap out of it

ill be here waitin ever so patiently for you to
