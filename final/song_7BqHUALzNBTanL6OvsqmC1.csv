lately ive been ive been thinking
i want you to be happier i want you to be happier

verse 1
when the morning comes
when we see what weve become
in the cold light of day were a flame in the wind
not the fire that weve begun
every argument every word we cant take back
cause with all that has happened
i think that we both know the way that this story ends

chorus
then only for a minute
i want to change my mind
cause this just dont feel right to me
i wanna raise your spirits
i want to see you smile but
know that means ill have to leave
know that means ill have to leave

when the evening falls
and im left there with my thoughts
and the image of you being with someone else
well its eating me up inside
but we ran our course we pretended were okay
now if we jump together at least we can swim
far away from the wreck we made

chorus
then only for a minute
i want to change my mind
cause this just dont feel right to me
i wanna raise your spirits
i want to see you smile but
know that means ill have to leave
know that means ill have to leave
