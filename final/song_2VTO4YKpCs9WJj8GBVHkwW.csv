what is the magic that makes ones eyes
sparkle and gleam light up the skies
the name of the game is lightworks
i see youre peein in your pants little sissy boy

verse 1
jerks welcome to the octagon
lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
keep your socks torn its a boxathon
with hard rock black rock  rons goin barbizon
curled up beggin layin on the canvas
instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
scissors lanvis grand fist sandwich
stance switch slammed on stitches twitch hands itch
damn snitch any street corner
could be the platform til we defeat gone and wander
watch your mouth jaw southpaw outs floor
doubt your clout more bout roar outscore boy
off the leash like ufc
off the beat off ya feet like two lefties
fubs heffer please
lost a few to stew beef new referees
what a remarkable team show your teeth

chorus
the shine that sparkles and gleams
light up the skies
the name of the game is lightworks
light up the spliffs
the name of the game is lightworks

wipe off slight smirks
the match was mapped out
get jabbed and crapslapped out tapped out
either the lunch bin or choke hold time
munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme

chorus
the shine that sparkles and gleams
light up the skies
the name of the game is lightworks
light up the spliffs
the name of the game is lightworks

outro
the right hurts
