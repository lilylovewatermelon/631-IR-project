verse 1
i know youre not a liar and i know you could set fire this day
go ahead and make me look away
strike me down i am calling your lightning down from your dark hiding place
go ahead and show me your face

chorus
reign down and destroy me
reign down and destroy me
reign down reign down

verse 2

i am simply very perplexed by your ways
why would you let us use your name

chorus
reign down and destroy me
reign down and destroy me
reign down and destroy me
reign down and destroy me

outro
reign down down
reign down down
