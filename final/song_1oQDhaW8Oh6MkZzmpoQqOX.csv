heres to the past

verse 1
lets all think back on what brought us here
this is my grasp on what is real
dont tell me how i feel
with all thats passed i cant relate
with myself from day to day
why does everything seem so far away to me

prechorus
theres no turning back from here
ive got to get away from everyone whos left
everyone whos left

chorus
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
they said wed walk away
youll never make it if you cant speak for yourself
they said wed fade away

verse 2
weve all been down this path before
youre stuck in this town and it wears you down
when we leave today then maybe youll understand
this constant struggle isnt always in the palm of my hand
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likeprechorus
theres no turning back from here
ive got to get away from everyone whos left
everyone whos left

chorus
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
they said wed walk away
youll never make it if you cant speak for yourself
they said wed fade away

bridge
this man will stand the test of time
this man will stand the test of time
this man will stand the test of time
this man will stand the test of time

chorus
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
ill tell the saddest story
of how we made it through this past year
they said wed walk away
youll never make it if you cant speak for yourself
they said wed fade away1embed"
