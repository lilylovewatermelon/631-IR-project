koo koo kachoo

verse 1
with the worries that id give her in
they told the worst of me
my wanting just to hold your neck in my arms
and feel me squeeze
no im not gonna give you what you want
so if you please
the sin that shapes your voice carries my ears
this new disease

chorus
did somebody take your tongue
in worries of the words that you couldnt say
if they couldve saved them from
but i dont wanna sleep without
so i bid to you goodnight
tonight sleep tight my love

verse 2
the anxious through the calming storm
youll sit as you pray for rain
ill touch it if you ask me to
but how is up to you
no im not gonna let you get up
if you struggle willingly
ill favor all your form to show you
how its been done to me
you might also likechorus
did somebody take your tongue
in worries of the words that you couldnt say
if they couldve saved them from
but i dont wanna sleep without
so i bid to you goodnight
tonight sleep tight my love

postchorus
with all the words you say
youll say
you were so well behaved
as you arched and made your way
this gift for you engraved
the shift as you stretch your legs
you were so well behaved
you were so well
who taught these tricks that make
you were so well behaved

bridge
if the world stops turning girl
you better not stop when i say
if there was nothing you could do to stop it
whyd you try
then the ground stops parting
through the silence as you woke up the dead
everything here dies alone
prechorus
but im not quite sure
what youve been told on labor day
ooh im not starting with you
but the faint of heart while worries wait
but im not quite sure
what this unfolds on labor day
ooh im not starting with you
but the faint of hearts

chorus
did somebody take your tongue
in worries of the words that you couldnt say
if they couldve saved them from
with all the words you say
but i dont wanna sleep without
so i bid to you goodnight
tonight sleep tight my love
with all the words you say
did somebody take your tongue no no
in worries of the words that you couldnt say
if they couldnt save them from
with all the words you say
but i dont wanna sleep without it
so i bid to you goodnight
tonight sleep tight my gunembed"
