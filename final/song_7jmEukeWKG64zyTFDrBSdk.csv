verse 1 the notorious big
relax and take notes while i take tokes of the marijuana smoke
throw you in a choke — gunsmoke gunsmoke
biggie smalls for mayor the rap slayer the hooker layer
motherfucker say your prayers
hail mary full of grace — smack the bitch in the face
take her gucci bag and the north face off her back jab her if she act
funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
i dont wanna rape ya i just want the paper
the visa capisceah im out like the vapors
whos the one you call mr macho
the head honcho swift fists like cumacho
i got so much style i should be down with the stylistics
make up to break up niggas need to wake up
smell the indonesia beat you to a seizure
then fuck your moms hit the skins to amnesia
she dont remember shit just the two hits
her hittin the floor and me hittin the clits
suckin on the tits had the hooker beggin for the dick
and your moms aint ugly love my dick got rock quick
i guess i was a combination of house of pain and bobby brown
i was humpin around and jumpin around
jacked her then i asked her whos the man
she said big then i bust in her eye

verse 2 the notorious big
when i get dusted i like to spread the blunt like mustard
trust it my hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
move over lucifer im more ruthless uh
leave you toothless youll kibitz ill flip it
tears dont affect me i hit em with the tec gs
disrespect me my potency is deadly
im shootin babies — no ifs ands or maybes
hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
slit the wrist of little sis
after she sucked the dick i stabbed her brother with the ice pick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
but smalls dont get down like that
found your father hidin in a room fucked him with the broom
slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
who you think youre dealin with
anybody step into my path is fuckin feeling it
hardcore i got it sucked like a pussy
stab you til youre gushy so please dont push me
im using rubbers so they wont trace the semen
the black demon got the little hookers screamin woo
because you know i love it young fresh and green
with no hair in between know what i mean

verse 3 eminem
theres several different levels to devil worshipin
horses heads human sacrifices cannibalism candles and exorcism
animals havin sex with em camels mammals and rabbits
but i dont get into that i kick the habit
i just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
and i never eat you unless the fuckin meat looks fresh
i got a lion in my pocket — im lyin i got a 9 in my pocket
and baby im just dyin to cock him
hes ready for war im ready for war
i got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
my uzis heavy as yours
yeah you met me before
i just didnt have as large an arsenal of weapons before
marshall will step in the door ill lay your head on the floor
with your body spread on the bedspread red on the wall
red on the ceiling red on the floor get a new whore
met on the second wed on the third then shes dead on the fourth
