hey oh yeah

verse 1
i can remember when i met you
you had all of my homies talking bout you
and i thought itd be cool if i got at you
so we can spend a little time
i can get to know you tell me your name
im beginning to see the more we hang together
baby girl i like you cause youre better
than any average chick
that i was rollin with
i knew it was love at first sight
i never met a girl like you before
i can count on you whenever i need to take it slow
and youll be taking me upup and away we go
you got my eyes so low where they damn near closed

there be times people be telling me to let you go
but the bond i got with you is stronger than they even know
and just to prove it to you girl you know i love you so much
i hit the corner store for you and scrape the guts out a dutch
its like the things you say to me when im feeling hurt
you pick me up when i go through it thats why i put you first
when everybody be only constantly stressing me worse
you the one that i come running to to ease my nerves
and i never met a girl like you before
i can count on you whenever i need to take it slow
and you be taking me upup and away we go
you got my eyes so low where they damn near closed

hook
