whats this whats this
theres color everywhere
whats this theres white things in the air
whats this i cant believe my eyes
i must be dreaming wake up jack this isnt fair
whats this
whats this whats this
theres something very wrong
whats this theres people singing songs
whats this the streets are lined with little creatures laughing
everybody seems so happy
have i possibly gone daffy what is this
whats this

chorus
theres children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
theyre busy building toys
and absolutely no ones dead
theres frost on every window
oh i cant believe my eyes
and in my bones i feel the warmth
thats coming from inside

verse 2
oh look whats this
theyre hanging mistletoe
they kiss why that looks so unique
inspired theyre gathering around to hear a story
roasting chestnuts on a fire whats this
whats this in here theyve got a little tree
how queer and who would ever think
and why theyre covering it with tiny little things
theyve got electric lights on strings
and theres a smile on everyone so now correct me if im wrong
this looks like fun this looks like fun
oh could it be i got my wish whats this
you might also likebridge
oh my what now
the children are asleep
but look theres nothing underneath
no ghouls no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them
only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland
ahh whats this

verse 3
the monsters are all missing
and the nightmares cant be found
and in their place there seems to be
good feeling all around
instead of screams i swear
i can hear music in the air
the smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

chorus
the sights the sounds
theyre everywhere and all around
ive never felt so good before
this empty place inside of me is filling up
i simply cannot get enough
i want it oh i want it oh i want it for my own
ive got to know ive got to know
what is this place that i have found
what is this
outro
christmas town hmm3embed"
