lets take a moment and break the ice
so my intentions are known
see i have pity in watchin you suffer
i know the feeling of bein damned alone
ive got a storybook of my own

chorus
dont you see i am your pride agent of wealth bearer of needs
and you know its right
that i am your war arming the strong aiding the weak
know me by name shepherd of fire

verse 2
well i can promise you paradise
no need to serve on your knees
and when youre lost in the darkest of hours
take a moment and tell me who you see
wont tell ya who not to be

chorus
now you know i am your pride agent of wealth bearer of needs
and you know its right
i am your war arming the strong aiding the weak
know me by name shepherd of fire

interlude
disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
make way the shepherd of fire

bridge
through the ages of time
ive been known for my hate
but im a dealer of simple choices
for me its never too late

outro
i am your pride agent of wealth bearer of needs
and you know its right
that i am your war arming the strong aiding the weak
i am your wrath i am your guilt i am your lust
and you know its right
that i am your law that i am your scar i am your trust
know me by name shepherd of fire28embed"
