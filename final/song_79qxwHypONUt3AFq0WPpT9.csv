when it rains it pours
but you didnt even notice
it aint rainin anymore
its hard to breathe when all you know is
the struggle of stayin above the risin water line

chorus
well the sky has finally opened
the rain and wind stopped blowin
but youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
you hold tight to your umbrella
well darlin im just tryin to tell ya
that theres always been a rainbow
hangin over your head

verse 2
if you could see what i see
youd be blinded by the colors
yellow red and orange and green
and at least a million others
so tie up the boat take off your coat
and take a look around

chorus
cause the sky has finally opened
the rain and wind stopped blowin
but youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
you hold tight to your umbrella
well darlin im just tryin to tell ya
that theres always been a rainbow
hangin over your head
you might also likebridge
oh tie up the boat take off your coat
and take a look around
everything is alright now

chorus
cause the sky has finally opened
the rain and wind stopped blowin
but youre stuck out in the same ol storm again
let go of your umbrella
cause darlin im just tryin to tell ya
that theres always been a rainbow
hangin over your head
yeah theres always been a rainbow
hangin over your head

outro
mmm
itll all be alright20embed"
