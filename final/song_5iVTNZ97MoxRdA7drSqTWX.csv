youve sure got a real nice place
so dont take this the wrong way
but i can tell by your decorating taste
youve been alone too long
youve got more candles than a midnight mass
that fancy mirror adds a touch of class
but do you know how good a mounted bass
would look there on that wall

chorus
you need a man around here
you cant do it all by yourself
to me its painfully clear
that you could use a little help
someone to kill the spiders
change the channel and drink the beer
seems to me that you sure need
a man around here

verse 2
thumbing through your stack of magazines
i dont see a maxim or field and stream
i havent been in a room this clean
since they took my appendix out
well youve gotta be kidding me
dont tell me that thing is your tv
my laptops got a bigger screen
baby there aint no doubt

verse 3
someone to kill the spiders
and by the way youre out of beer
seems to me that you sure need
a man around here
yeah it seems to me that you sure need
a man around hereembed"
