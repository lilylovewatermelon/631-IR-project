these people been talkin bout me for a while
i could never ever let them get to me
girl i just need to know that youre not my enemy
said you down to ride baby is you down to slide
is you gon be my baby ride or die
pull up wit the stick you know how i ride
empty out the clip then you know im gon slide

my loves so unconditional can you believe
im not like these other guys who give up

love is moving fast
the feelings always grow
i want to hear your voice
i love it so
i pray for some love
and send it all to you
i know it aint much
but its all i could dosee eyedress liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeembed"
