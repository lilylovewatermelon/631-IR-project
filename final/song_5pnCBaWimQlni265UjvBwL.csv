who are you
the one for whom i’d really gladly suffer
who are you
the one i’d always love above another
you’re my world you’re my hope
you’re all my dreams and all my heart

chorus
who are you
the one id give my life to
who are you
that loves as deep as i do

who are you
who takes me through the flood and through the fire
who are you
who leads me through the desert and the dry
you’re in my thoughts you know my mind
you are my fate you are my light

that loves as deep as i do
