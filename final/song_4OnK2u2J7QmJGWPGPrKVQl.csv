fake and fall stop and stall
take it all back cause im taking mine

time is up out of luck
shoulda stood up when you had the time
cause youre out of time
lets do this
fight fight
lock and load rock and roll
bitch its all over youre going down youre going down

get ready to settle the score
and get ready to face the floor
cause its time to remember it
this is war and its on tonight
so get up and fight get up and fight
youve had all your life to run and hide
now step up
now step up

lets do this

second round going down
how about a little reaction man
you can barely stand
bitch slap slow attack
man that was practically suicide
next in line
lets go
fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight

and get ready to face the floor
