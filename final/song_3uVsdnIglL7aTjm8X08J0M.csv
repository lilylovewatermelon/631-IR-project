some say ill be better without you
but they dont know you like i do
or at least the sides i thought i knew
i cant bear this time
it drags on as i lose my mind
reminded by things i find
like notes and clothes you left behind
wake me up wake me up when all is done
i wont rise until this battles won
my dignitys become undone

chorus
but i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk
i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk

verse 2
so petrified im so scared to step into this ride
what if i lose my heart and fail the climb
i wont forgive me if i give up trying
i heard his voice today
i didnt know a single word he said
not one resemblance to the man i met
just a vague and broken boy instead

but i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk
i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
i im willing to take the risk

bridge
there will be times well try and give it up
bursting at the seams no doubt
well almost fall apart then burn the pieces
to watch them turn to dust
but nothing will ever taint us

chorus
i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk
i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
i im willing to take the risk
verse 3
will he will he still remember me
will he still love me even when hes free
or will he go back to the place where he
will choose the poison over me
when we spoke yesterday
he said to hold my breath and sit and wait
ill be home so soon i wont be late

chorus
he wont go
he cant do it on his own
if this aint love then what is
hes willing to take the risk
so i wont go
he cant do it on his own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk
cause he wont go
he cant do it on his own
if this aint love then what is
were willing to take the risk
i wont go
i cant do it on my own
if this aint love then what is
im willing to take the risk25embed"
