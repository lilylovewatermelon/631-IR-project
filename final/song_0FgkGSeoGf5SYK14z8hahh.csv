we could blame the world forever
we could just escape together
so are we breaking out or are we breaking down
we cant blame this world forever this world forever

verse 1
the end will never come
theres still a mountain left to climb
but we will overcome
the hurdles placed inside our minds
so close but still so far
each day will bring us brand new scars
what are we fighting for
we cannot live like this no more
cause in the thick of darkened days we know

chorus
we could blame the world forever
we could just escape together
so are we breaking out breaking out or are we breaking down breaking down
we cant blame this world forever this world forever

verse 2
just need some clarity cant seem to open up these eyes
for what your sympathy it took me time to realize
this is not what i want
or how i thought this life would be
this is not what we need
so take this shit away from me
because in the thick of darkened days we know
you might also likechorus
we could blame the world forever
we could just escape together
so are we breaking out breaking out or are we breaking down breaking down
we cant blame this world forever this world forever
