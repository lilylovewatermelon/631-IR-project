the freedom bell ring when they set a nigga free
im flyin’ like an eagle when they let me off the leash
gotta prove everybody wrong lookin down on me
when im flyin’ like an eagle
in the streets where i call home this is where i wanna be
do i gotta go to jail so i can find a lil peace
could you be the one i call on will you answer when you sleep
could you be the one i call on

prechorus
i aint never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck
im searchin for my soul hope you know where it went
is it cold like my heart could it take me where ive never been
im never really happy smilin when it’s never meant

chorus
i’ve been searchin for my soul my heart
di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
i got this money but it’s nothin right now
cause im needin’ somethin
im needin somethin
ive been searchin for my soul my heart
di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
i got this money but its nothin right now
cause im needin somethin

all this pain make me sing songs
aint no love in the sewer that i came from
aint no love in the sewer that i came in from
i cant say that i dont miss my nigga john john
got the streets cheerin for me with they pompoms
i done ran up all this money got me nauseous
i done ran up all this money got me nauseous
i done did so many wrongs it got me cautious
but i cant ever tell the time in all these watches
and i can never read the mind of all these thotties
broward county poppin molly droppin bodies
i cant lie and say that i dont love you shawty
you know that you want me right there well you got me
all this fame got me nauseous
tryna dodge the reaper got me boxed in

prechorus
i aint never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck
im searchin for my soul hope you know where it went
is it cold like my heart could it take me where ive never been
im never really happy smilin when its never meant

chorus
ive been searchin for my soul my heart
di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
i got this money but its nothin right now
cause im needin somethin
im needin somethin
ive been searchin for my soul my heart
di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
i got this money but its nothin right now
cause im needin somethin
cause im needin somethinembed"
