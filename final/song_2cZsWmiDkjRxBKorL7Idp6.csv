get up get out this is your wake up call
we run this town and you cant fight us all
we keep em coming back for more
dont think you can hold us down
well tear this building down
try to be careful what you say

prechorus
give it up your tact is astounding
find your place and leave us with some
peace of mind
you do this every time

chorus
so heres to another banner year
weve crossed that thin line dont try to hold us here
if for just this once youd think of us
i hope youre happy with yourself

verse 2
get up get out whos gonna break your fall
when we dont back down youre gonna seem so small
we keep em running for the door
just wait things will come back around
its too late for them theyre headed straight for a melt down
im not a part of your clich√©
