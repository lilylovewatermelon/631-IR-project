white knuckles
and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
clenched shut jaw
ive got another headache again tonight
eyes on fire eyes on fire
and they burn from all the tears
ive been crying ive been crying
ive been dying over you
tie a knot in the rope
tryna hold tryna to hold
but theres nothing to grab
so i let go

chorus
i think i finally had enough
i think i maybe think too much
i think this might be it for us
blow me one last kiss
you think im just too serious
i think youre full of shit
my head is spinning so
blow me one last kiss
just when it cant get worse
ive had a shit day
have you had a shit day
weve had a shit day
i think that lifes too short for this
i want back my ignorance and bliss
i think ive had enough of this
blow me one last kiss
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeverse 2
i wont miss
all of the fighting that we always did
take it in
i mean what i say when i say there is nothing left
no more sick whiskey dick
no more battles for me
youll be calling a trick
cause you no longer sleep
ill dress nice ill look good
ill go dancing alone
i will laugh ill get drunk
ill take somebody home

chorus
i think i finally had enough
i think i maybe think too much
i think this might be it for us
blow me one last kiss
you think im just too serious
i think youre full of shit
my head is spinning so
blow me one last kiss
just when it cant get worse
ive had a shit day
have you had a shit day
weve had a shit day
i think that lifes too short for this
i want back my ignorance and bliss
i think ive had enough of this
blow me one last kiss

bridge
i will do what i please
anything that i want
i will breathe i will breathe
i wont worry at all
you will pay for your sins
youll be sorry my dear
all the lies all the whys will all be crystal clear

chorus
i think i finally had enough
i think i maybe think too much
i think this might be it for us
blow me one last kiss
you think im just too serious
i think youre full of shit
my head is spinning so
blow me one last kiss
just when it cant get worse
ive had a shit day
have you had a shit day
weve had a shit day
i think that lifes too short for this
i want back my ignorance and bliss
i think ive had enough of this
