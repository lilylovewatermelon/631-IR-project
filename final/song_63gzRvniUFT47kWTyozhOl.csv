high heels on hair did
cant no other woman rock a dress like this
body bangs doing her thang
she the only reason for the song i sing
and i wish i could be there when she get ready to go
dancing in the mirror and talking on the phone
telling all the home girls what she putting on
they already know she putting on

chorus
cause when she hit the club heads turn around
she living it up drinks up in the club
im in love from afar
baby girl i wanna be where you are
be where you are
where you are where you are
baby girl i wanna be where you are
be where you are
where you are where you are
girl i wanna be where you are

verse 2
