i woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
and put my cold feet on the floor
forgot about yesterday remembering
im pretendin to be who im not anymore
a little taste of hypocrisy
and im left in the wake of the mistakes slow to react
and even though youre so close to me
youre still so distant and i cant bring you back

prechorus chester bennington
its true the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories even if youre not with me

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
im with you you now i see keepin everything inside
with you you now i see even when i close my eyes

verse 2 mike shinoda
i hit you and you hit me back
we fall to the floor the rest of the day stands still
fine line between this and that
when things go wrong i pretend that the past isnt real
now im trapped in this memory
and im left in the wake of the mistakes slow to react
so even though youre close to me
youre still so distant and i cant bring you back
