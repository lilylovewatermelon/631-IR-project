i want to sleep
if you are awake
still making believe
that you arent at all crazy

chorus
and if you dont believe i think you should
youd make me so proud
still you love to think you have always been this way
but youre all wrong

verse 2
and you only sleep
when youve lost cause
well i still believe
that the cause was always me

chorus
and if you dont believe i think you should
youd make me so proud
still you love to think you have always been this way
well id love to think you will someday feel the same
and you love to think it will always
always
if you still believe it will always be this way
well youre all wrong
