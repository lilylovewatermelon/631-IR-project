verse 1
when i first started never knew if they will listen ah
but when i write i produce passion thats mel gibson hey
if music is a disease i promise im infected ah
i dream on different levels of dreams—inception no
and these beats are my playground let the words play ah
you aint catch it thats wordplay now youre stuck on the word play
im all business no suit on but thats okay ah
i will ko you ko if you come in my work space here yet
and dont you ever try to tell me i lack passion ah
im a stand up guy i promise you aint laughin
these rappers are slowin the game down—bad traffic ah
and how you gon put me in a category of wack rapper
yeah listen im hulk i transform and i smash rappers
you sippin on syrup that doesnt mean youre a sick rapper
see what it means is you gon prolly get sick after
you dont like that im blunt or is it the fact that i smoke past ya

verse 2
i put work in this music you think im makin this up nope
if the songs aint sharp trust me they aint makin the cut get it
you dont like it im no teacher but youll learn to adjust
im my own worst critic so critics step your hate game up
im a different breed of artist i know how to survive ah
you come into my lane you better know how to drive
and i suggest you buckle up if you gon come on this ride
no johnny cash but some of yall are walkin the line
but you wrong though wrong though yall look curious ah
heath ledger type of questions like why so serious
and you want watered down lyrics well i dont carry em ah
i dig holes for these tracks and then i slaughter and bury em
the motivation i got is on a whole different level
i treat these lines like court case i dont wanna settle
and my lyrics are bullets and theyre aimin at you
and i aint talkin switchfoot when i dare you to move

dont step on me or youll get blown sky high
and i dont mean secrets when i say to keep it in mind
that im ill with the words—too sick
they say i rap hungry ah well thats cause im starvin—diesel
thats why they callin me riddickulous ah
cause the look in my eyes is different woo ha ha ha
