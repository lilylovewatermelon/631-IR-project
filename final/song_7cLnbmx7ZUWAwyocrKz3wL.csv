verse
fucked up nigga i dont want your pity
i just wanted love but im way too busy
rap moving up i might come to your city
its hot in the h but my heart still chilly
i just need a gram some bread and a quickie
if i aint your man i dont want no hickey
right now i aint shit cause the road look shitty
been like that for months i might roll a blunt
and hit that shit once cause a nigga been sober goddamn
god i cant wait til the day this shit over goddamn
used to walking round with a chip on my shoulder
for every last person i loved who folded i know
i would give grace but id rather give closure i know
i would take breaks but id rather move forward i wont
i done been chewed up spit out kicked out let down
but im still a motherfucking soldier
so fuck what you told me if you showed me different
fuck what you showed me if you came up missing
i know that actions speak louder than words
the thing about yours they never consistent
i done got paid more than i paid attention
i done felt pain more than i like to mention
heart on my sleeve til its left on the curb
when i smoke this herb i cant make good decisions
you niggas be bitches you bitches be hoes
you switching up more than you switch your clothes
i push that work til i get it in gold
and light up that heat when the nights get too cold
the only thing keeping me up from the lows
besides all the bread ima make from these shows
my life going fast and i like moving slow
and ive been on numb four five days in a row
you might also likechorus
i might fly away yeah yeah
i might fly away yeah yeah
ill be fine today yeah yeah
ill be fine today yeah yeah
i might fly away yeah yeah fly away go fly
i might fly away yeah yeah fly away go fly
ill be fine today yeah yeah fine you gon be fine
ill be fine today yeah yeah fine you gon be fine
yeah yeah
