chorus flo rida
i pulled up to the club on dubs
they say look at them go look at them go
and raised up with some girls tryin to cut
three times in a row times in a row
cause i spent twenty on my tires thirty to be icy
but me bein fly thats priceless
and i gave forty to my side chick fifty to the wifey
but me bein fly thats priceless baby thats priceless

verse 1 flo rida
im straight up out the projects hustlin thats the object
if ye aint talkin cash then you better switch the topic
bitch nigga stop it gon ahead and cop it
money in the bag call it takin out the garbage
i know them boys snitchin cause theyre scared of first degree

im so fly not to mention that im priceless
ye aint never seen heard or felt nothin like this
thousand dollar jeans air force two nikes
whylin in the club give a fuck about indictments
scuse me bartender but the drinks are on me
two magnums in my hand one for creeps one for freaks
too much legal tender so its rainin bubbly
my ice the same color what kelis hair used to be
hold up wait a minute
popeye niggas aint eatin they spinach
i made to make dollars so it have to make sense
im pourin out liquor for my dead presidents
all of em dead all of em die
toetag money see it fallin out the sky
bitch if i aint priceless then bury me alive
my pockets like caskets death live inside
