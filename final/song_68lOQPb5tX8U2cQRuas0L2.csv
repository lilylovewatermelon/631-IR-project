i used to smoke to get high now i smoke to get vibes
i used to tote the semi i still tote the semi
i used to walk a thin line now im walking chin high
i used to fuck and get tired now i fuck her ten times
she used to make me dick rise now she make me ribeyes
she used to make me sixnine now she make her friend try
she used to make me love her now she make me realize
its money over bitches till the day i dizzie
keep it on the east side keep it on the bside
i feel like ivan drago if he dies he dies

verse 1 lil wayne
find out where he reside and find out where he hide
run up in that bitch like hey poppoppop peace sign
percocet promethazine you can call me prod
taking shots at my team you must be getting senile
you goin at my slime then youre going at me slime
your blood all over the scene it look like red cheap wine
im smoking on a key lime you look like tea time
look like honey to my beehive i close your sweet eyes
shoot ya in ya head give ya ass three eyes
and you still aint seen a fucking thing until you c5
i remember you i was never into you
i tell my shooters shoot you and whoever resemble you
and every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
they in it too and bitches too they mention you they dentures loose
run up in a nigga house pistol in that nigga mouth
safe code now nigga cough it up or spit it out
oh my god im flipping out flipping out then dipping out
i tried to turn the fuckin page oh my god i ripped it out

verse 2 lil wayne
i used to know you niggas i dont know you niggas
i just ignore you niggas i dont bro you niggas
with my bros will smoke you niggas like we grow you niggas
kill your ho too nigga and your goto niggas
ive been riding round the city with the safety off
glock nine and its pretty like a baby doll
you niggas bitches and its pissing all the ladies off
my finger sitting on the trigger like a lazboy
if there was beef im in the kitchen with the apron on
put his words on the plate that nigga ate em all
and i aint wit the talking but damn now he talking
nigga spilled the beans damn now its coffee
looking for your pussy ass like i got a warrant
i throw on the ski mask thats a private party
bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
rock your bells ll nigga locked and loaded
chorus lil wayne
i used to smoke to get high now i smoke to get vibes
i used to tote the semi i still tote the semi
keep it on the east side keep it on the beast side
i feel like ivan drago lil bitch and if he dies he dies
if he dies he dies
