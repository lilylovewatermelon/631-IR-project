hold up youre movin too fast
im up for something that last
i aint looking to screw on the first night
cause thats a nogo
and if the vibes good go to first base
cause the first kiss could be your last taste
i aint lookin to screw till the vibes right

verse 2
my will is stronger than most
i will not let you get close
until i think that you deserve me

until i think that you deserve me

im holdin out im gonna wait
wanna make it past the first date
a little time then we can do
all the nasty things you wanna do

and i really hope you understand
that its easier when every second counts
so well just have to wait
its really no big deal
its really no big deal

verse 3
id hate to get you in bed
find out youre empty instead
no need to knock another home run out
cause thats a nogo
and id hate to be so filthy
if we were not meant to be
no need to knock another home run out
