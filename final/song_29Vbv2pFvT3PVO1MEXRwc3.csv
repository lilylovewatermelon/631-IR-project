from the moment you said why havent you kissed me yet
i knew id wipe that paint from your lips
i stare the lids off your eyes go down on your dirty mind
and end up between your hips
handfuls of sweattangled hair anytime anywhere
i wanna lick you too much baby
i just play all alone whispering for your moan
forced to crawl down this line just to touch

bridge
i can get in i cant get out
i can get in i cant get out

verse 2
im just sweating my sheets i hate to see you leave
but i love to watch you go baby
twisted secret lives the way you bat your eyes
givin head givin head

guitar solo

verse 3
watch you come from above im so needy for love
im desperate greedy in slavery
sneak around from behind i got a onetrack mind
we got a skinonskin thing baby
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeoutro
i wanna lick you too much i wanna lick you too much
i hear you comin oohahh baby
i wanna lick you too much i wanna lick you too much
i hear you comin oohahh hey
