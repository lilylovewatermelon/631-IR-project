i realized i belong to you
i feel the darkness when away from you hey yeah

prechorus
dont stop your lovin walk out on me
dont stop for nothin youre what i bleed
i learned to love you the way you need
cause i know whats pain this is not the same

chorus
ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin nothin
ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin nothin yeah
i was too busy tryna find you with someone else
the one i couldnt stand to be with was myself
cause ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin

verse 2
pick up your phone i got a question oh
if i die tonight would you regret it woahwoah

prechorus
dont stop your lovin its all i have
cause i cant function no i wont last
i swear ill love you just like the past
cause i know whats pain this is not the same
you might also likechorus
ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin nothin oh
ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin nothin
i was too busy tryna find you with someone else
the one i couldnt stand to be with was myself
cause ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin without you
nothin nothin nothin

outro

without your touch touch touch
ill be nothin nothin nothin nothin
