pipe that shit up tnt
thats vade on the keys
niggas dyin fallin stars through the night
and i been thinkin bout you every night
if you happy i know that i should be alright
cause this tragic and i cant seem for to decide

chorus
and i think i just i should leave i just
should i leave it lone i
should i try or just i cant lie i just
i be wantin for to cry
but im caught up with these hoes they gon follow
ballin like a baller blocker
every time i catch my feelings lock em in a bottle
and you probably find my heart somewhere lost in nevada in nevada

verse
dont know who i want you the one i want oh
never said i dont thats that money talk oh talk
drunker than a skunk it go down in the room down
choppеrs in the trunk baby this that slime tune
but i need your lovе like right now baby ooh ooh
im not on no drugs not right now its the truth truth
i apologize for you lookin like a fool sorry
i cant hold you right now so i been holdin on my tool
i dont want my ex i dont want no bitch i had dont
i just want a chance hopefully i make you glad don’t
if you turn me down tell the truth i just might spazz spazz
if who around laugh i just probably bust they ass bust they ass

and i think i just i should leave i just
should i leave it lone i
should i try or just i cant lie i just
