you and i we’re two of a kind
i hate to say it but you’ll never relate
what makes you tick
and makes me smile

you said that i should get away from it all
and bury my head in the sand if i want to
i think you…
should thank me now

chorus
you were lying wide awake in the garden
trying to get over your stardom
and i could never see you depart us
and you’re my baby
you’re just another girl
just another girl

verse 2 pete yorn
i never mind the way i had to see ya
my working on a day show never explains why i see you
and i feel your pain

i love to wear my work inside of my head
i can’t complain but you should never react the way you did
i feel your time

you were lying wide awake in the garden
trying to get over your stardom
and i could never see you depart us
and you’re my baby…

and you were lying wide awake in the garden
trying to get over your stardom
and i could never see you depart us
and you’re my baby
you’re just another girl
youre just another girl
youre just another girlembed"
