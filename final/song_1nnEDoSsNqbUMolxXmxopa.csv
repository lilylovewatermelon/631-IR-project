had to move from davie cause that shit went local
pick up the mansion and i sat that bitch back down in boca

til i fuck them in the ass out in acapulco
im thinkin money every moment thinkin money
i bust a nut then im back to thinkin money

her mouth slow my eyes closed
you gotta judge a man by his principles
teflon don i am invincible

i’ll let you borrow mine i think i’m mc hammer
i never borrowed jewelry i’m tippin naked dancers
it’s an occasion a celebration at central station
with haitian hoes and jamaicans i’m tryna make it
old school wanna race it we can test it
i’m flexin i’ll leave a sucker eatin dust for breakfast
so expect the unexpected i’m well connected
