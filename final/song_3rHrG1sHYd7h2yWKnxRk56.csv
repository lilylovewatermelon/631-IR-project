girl i wanna be wanna be what keeps you up at night

verse 1
you and me and these headlights
engine idling in your drive
45 in a goodbye yeah
i should probably get to goin
sun will rise before we know it
but while the moon is still glowing
let me leave a little taste on your lips
a little chill runnin under your skin
so when its a quarter past three youre still thinking bout me

chorus
girl i wanna be what keeps you up at night
tossing and turning head spinning like youre dizzy off of red wine
oh i wanna kiss you til i cant get off your mind
girl i wanna be wanna be what keeps you up at night yeah

verse 2
a little spray of my cologne all over your pillows
still feels like im so close
let me leave my shape in your bed
let me leave a little song in your head
make you dance in the dark like youre still in my arms
see dan  shay liveget tickets as low as 12you might also likechorus
girl i wanna be what keeps you up at night
tossing and turning head spinning like youre dizzy off of red wine
oh i wanna kiss you til i cant get off your mind
girl i wanna be wanna be what keeps you up at night
mmm oh wanna be i wanna be yeah

bridge
so when youre wide awake
and im the only thing on your brain
just call and ill be there to fall right in your sheets

chorus
girl i wanna be what keeps you up at night
tossing and turning head spinning like youre dizzy off of red wine
oh i wanna kiss you til i cant get off your mind
girl i wanna be wanna be what keeps you up at night
