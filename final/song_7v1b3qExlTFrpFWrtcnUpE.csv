when the moon fell in love with the sun
all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night

verse 1
when the sun found the moon
she was drinking tea in a garden
under the green umbrella trees
in the middle of summer
when the moon found the sun
he looked like he was barely hanging on
but her eyes saved his life
in the middle of summer

chorus
in the middle of summer all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night
summer all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night
summer summer summer summer
golden when the day met the night

verse 2
so he said would it be alright
if we just sat and talked for a little while
if in exchange for your time
i give you this smile
so she said thats okay
as long as you can make a promise
not to break my little heart
or leave me all alone in the summer

well he was just hanging around then he fell in love
and he didnt know how but he couldnt get out
just hanging around then he fell in love

chorus
in the middle of summer all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night
summer all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night
summer summer summer summer

when the moon fell in love with the sun
all was golden in the sky
all was golden when the day met the night
