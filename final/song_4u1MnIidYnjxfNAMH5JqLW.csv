im underwater and all forgotten now
ive not been here before so i might not get out
to swim and slaughter my inhibitions found
ive not been here before so i might not make it out

verse 2
to know my own self i am forever proud
ive been knocked sideways ive been knocked down
to know my own self i am forever found
to do things my way and leave no doubts

chorus
one look and it all falls down
well read them books its in there ive found
take a second look think his feet just left the ground
long live the loneliest boy in town

bridge
and if oceans come between us
let the earth become the sky
let the misty mountains come crumblin down
to the riverside
and the people man theyre grievin
but the birds sing songs of hope
and im right there between em
havin a long long toke

well read them books its in there ive found
take a second look think his feet just left the ground
long live the loneliest boy in town

long live the loneliest boy in townembed"
