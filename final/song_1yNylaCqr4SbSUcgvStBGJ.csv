in a perfect world i wouldnt have met you at all
in a perfect world i wouldve said “hi” and moved on

chorus
unfortunately i dont know anything
bout love or its foolish tendencies
and just like chet i tend to fall in love too easily

verse 2
in a perfect world id live out my days by the sea
in a light blue cottage
just the sand and ocean and me

chorus
unfortunately im too romantic
dramatic for that reality
i go ahead and just like chet i fall in love too easily

bridge
why did you put me through
eleven months of “youre so prettys” “i miss yous”
its absurd what even occurred
between autumn and spring
if you never loved me
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 3
in a perfect world i wouldnt have met you that night
wouldve stayed with my friends and just danced til the morning light

chorus
unfortunately i cant trust anybody
that tells me anything
and just like that i tend to fall a little hard a little fast
at every turn i feel a little heartbreak and a little burn
and just like chet 
i tend to fall in love too easily1embed"
