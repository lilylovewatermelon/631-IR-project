such a little helpless creature will only be in the way i said you had better pass him up to the indian boys on the wharf to be taken home to play with the children this trip is not likely to be good for toydogs the poor silly thing will be in rain and snow for weeks or months and will require care like a baby but his master assured me that he would be no trouble at all that he was a perfect wonder of a dog could endure cold and hunger like a bear swim like a seal and was wondrous wise and cunning etc making out a list of virtues to show he might be the most interesting member of the party

nobody could hope to unravel the lines of his ancestry in all the wonderfully mixed and varied dogtribe i never saw any creature very much like him though in some of his sly soft gliding motions and gestures he brought the fox to mind he was shortlegged and bunchbodied and his hair though smooth was long and silky and slightly waved so that when the wind was at his back it ruffled making him look shaggy at first sight his only noticeable feature was his fine tail which was about as airy and shady as a squirrels  and was carried curling forward almost to his nose on closer inspection you might notice his thin sensitive ears and sharp eyes with cunning tanspots above them mr young told me that when the little fellow was a pup about the size of a woodrat he was presented to his wife by an irish prospector at sitka and that on his arrival at fort wrangell he was adopted with enthusiasm by the stickeen indians as a sort of new goodluck totem was named stickeen for the tribe and became a universal favorite petted protected and admired wherever he went and regarded as a mysterious fountain of wisdom

on our trip he soon proved himself a queer characterodd concealed independent keeping invincibly quiet and doing many little puzzling things that piqued my curiosity as we sailed week after week through the long intricate channels and inlets among the innumerable islands and mountains of the coast he spent most of the dull days in sluggish ease motionless and apparently as unobserving as if in deep sleep but i discovered that somehow he always knew what was going on when the indians were about to shoot at ducks or seals or when anything along the shore was exciting our attention he would rest his chin on the edge of the canoe and calmly look out like a dreamyeyed tourist and when he heard us talking about making a landing he immediately roused himself to see what sort of a place we were coming to and made ready to jump overboard and swim ashore as soon as the canoe neared the bench then with a vigorous shake to get rid of the brine in his hair he ran into the woods to hunt small game but though always the first out of the canoe he was always the last to get into it when we were ready to start he could never be found and refused to come to our call we soon found out however that though we could not see him at such times he saw us and from the cover of the briers and huckleberry bushes in the fringe of the woods was watching the canoe with wary eye for as soon as we were fairly off he came trotting down the beach plunged into the surf and swam after us knowing well that we would cease rowing and take him in when the contrary little vagabond came alongside he was lifted by the neck held at arms length a moment to drip and dropped aboard we tried to cure him of this trick by compelling him to swim a long way as if we had a mind to abandon him but this did no good the longer the swim the better he seemed to like it

though capable of great idleness he never failed to be ready for all sorts of adventures and excursions one pitchdark rainy night we landed about ten oclock at the mouth of a salmon stream when the water was phosphorescent  the salmon were running  and the myriad fins of the onrushing multitude were churning all the stream into a silvery glow wonderfully beautiful and impressive in the ebon darkness to get a good view of the show i set out with one of the indians and sailed up through the midst of it to the foot of a rapid about half a mile from camp where the swift current dashing over rocks made the luminous glow most glorious happening to look back down the stream while the indian was catching a few of the struggling fish i saw a long spreading fan of light like the tail of a comet which we thought must be made by some big strange animal that was pursuing us on it came with its magnificent train until we imagined we could see the monsters head and eyes but it was only stickeen who finding i had left the camp came swimming after me to see what was up

when we camped early the best hunter of the crew usually went to the woods for a deer and stickeen was sure to be at his heels provided i had not gone out for strange to say though i never carried a gun he always followed me forsaking the hunter and even his master to share my wonderings the days that were too stormy for sailing i spent in the woods or on the adjacent mountains wherever my studies called me and stickeen always insisted on going with me however wild the weather gliding like a fox through dripping huckleberry bushes and thorny tangles of panax and rubus  scarce stirring their rainladen leaves wading and wallowing through snow swimming icy streams skipping over logs and rocks and the crevasses of glaciers with the patience and endurance of a determined mountaineer never tiring or getting discouraged once he followed me over a glacier the surface of which was so crusty and rough that it cut his feet until every step was marked with blood but he trotted on with indian fortitude until i noticed his red track and taking pity on him made him a set of moccasins out of a handkerchief however great his troubles he never asked help or made any complaint as if like a philosopher he had learned that without hard work and suffering there could be no pleasure worth having

yet none of us was able to make out what stickeen was really good for he seemed to meet danger and hardships without anything like reason insisted on having his own way never obeyed an order and the hunter could never set him on anything or make him fetch the birds he shot his equanimity was so steady it seemed due to want of feeling ordinary storms were pleasures to him and as for mere rain he flourished in it like a vegetable no matter what advances you might make scarce a glance or a tailwag would you get for your pains but though he was apparently as cold as a glacier and about as impervious to fun i tried hard to make his acquaintance guessing there must be something worth while hidden beneath so much courage endurance and love of wildweathery adventure no superannuated mastiff or bulldog grown old in office surpassed this fluffy midget in stoic dignity he sometimes reminded me of a small squat unshakable desert cactus for he never displayed a single trace of the merry tricksy elfish fun of the terriers and collies that we all know nor of their touching affection and devotion like children most small dogs beg to be loved and allowed to love but stickeen seemed a very diogenes  asking only to be let alone a true child of the wilderness holding the even tenor of his hidden life with the silence and serenity of nature his strength of character lay in his eyes they looked as old as the hills and as young and as wild i never tired of looking into them it was like looking into a landscape but they were small and rather deepset and had no explaining lines around them to give out particulars i was accustomed to look into the faces of plants and animals and i watched the little sphinx more and more keenly as an interesting study but there is no estimating the wit and wisdom concealed and latent in our lower fellow mortals until made manifest by profound experiences for it is through suffering that dogs as well as saints are developed and made perfect

after exploring the sum dum and tahkoo fiords and their glaciers we sailed through stephens passage into lynn canal and thence through icy strait into cross sound searching for unexplored inlets leading toward the great fountain icefields of the fairweather range here while the tide was in our favor we were accompanied by a fleet of icebergs drifting out to the ocean from glacier bay  slowly we paddled around vancouvers point wimbledon our frail canoe tossed like a feather on the massive heaving swells coming in past cape spenser for miles the sound is bounded by precipitous mural cliffs which lashed with wavespray and their heads hidden in clouds looked terribly threatening and stern had our canoe been crushed or upset we could have made no landing here for the cliffs as high as those of yosemite  sink sheer into deep water eagerly we scanned the wall on the north side for the first sign of an opening fiord or harbor all of us anxious except stickeen who dozed in peace or gazed dreamily at the tremendous precipices when he heard us talking about them at length we made the joyful discovery of the mouth of the inlet now called taylor bay and about five oclock reached the head of it and encamped in a spruce grove near the front of a large glacier

while camp was being made joe the hunter climbed the mountain wall on the east side of the fiord in pursuit of wild goats while mr young and i went to the glacier we found that it is separated from the waters of the inlet by a tidewashed moraine and extends an abrupt barrier all the way across from wall to wall of the inlet a distance of about three miles but our most interesting discovery was that it had recently advanced though again slightly receding a portion of the terminal moraine had been plowed up and shoved forward uprooting and overwhelming the woods on the east side many of the trees were down and buried or nearly so others were leaning away from the icecliffs ready to fall and some stood erect with the bottom of the ice plow still beneath their roots and its lofty crystal spires towering huge above their tops the spectacle presented by these centuryold trees standing close beside a spiry wall of ice with their branches almost touching it was most novel and striking and when i climbed around the front and a little way up the west side of the glacier i found that it had swelled and increased in height and width in accordance with its advance and carried away the outer ranks of trees on its bank

on our way back to camp after these first observations i planned a farandwide excursion for the morrow i awoke early called not only by the glacier which had been on my mind all night but by a grand floodstorm the wind was blowing a gale from the north and the rain was flying with the clouds in a wide passionate horizontal flood as if it were all passing over the country instead of falling on it the main perennial streams were booming high above their banks and hundreds of new ones roaring like the sea almost covered the lofty gray walls of the inlet with white cascades and falls i had intended making a cup of coffee and getting something like a breakfast before starting but when i heard the storm and looked out i made haste to join it for many of natures finest lessons are to be found in her storms  and if careful to keep in right relations with them we may go safely abroad with them rejoicing in the grandeur and beauty of their works and ways and chanting with the old norsemen the blast of the tempest aids our oars the hurricane is our servant and drives us whither we wish to go so omitting breakfast i put a piece of bread in my pocket and hurried away

mr young and the indian were asleep and so i hoped was stickeen but i had not gone a dozen rods before he left his bed in the tent and came boring through the blast after me that a man should welcome storms for their exhilarating music and motion and go forth to see god making landscapes is reasonable enough but what fascination could there be in such tremendous weather for a dog surely nothing akin to human enthusiasm for scenery or geology anyhow on he came breakfastless through the choking blast i stopped and did my best to turn him back now dont i said shouting to make myself heard in the storm now dont stickeen what has got into your queer noddle now you must be daft this wild day has nothing for you there is no game abroad nothing but weather go back to camp and keep warm get a good breakfast with your master and be sensible for once i cant carry you all day or feed you and this storm will kill you

but nature it seems was at the bottom of the affair and she gains her ends with dogs as well as with men making us do as she likes shoving and pulling us along her ways however rough all but killing us at times in getting her lessons driven hard home after i had stopped again and again shouting good warning advice i saw that he was not to be shaken off as well might the earth try to shake off the moon i had once led his master into trouble when he fell on one of the topmost jags of a mountain and dislocated his arm  now the turn of his humble companion was coming the pitiful wanderer just stood there in the wind drenched and blinking saying doggedly  where thou goest i will go so at last i told him to come on if he must and gave him a piece of the bread i had in my pocket then we struggled on together and thus began the most memorable of all my wild days

the level flood driving hard in our faces thrashed and washed us wildly until we got into the shelter of a grove on the east side of the glacier near the front where we stopped awhile for breath and to listen and look out the exploration of the glacier was my main object but the wind was too high to allow excursions over its open surface where one might be dangerously shoved while balancing for a jump on the brink of a crevasse in the mean time the storm was a fine study there the end of the glacier descending an abrupt swell of resisting rock about five hundred feet high leans forward and falls in icecascades and as the storm came down the glacier from the north stickeen and i were beneath the main current of the blast while favorably located to see and hear it what a psalm the storm was singing and how fresh the smell of the washed earth and leaves and how sweet the still small voices of the storm detached wafts and swirls were coming through the woods with music from the leaves and branches and furrowed boles and even from the splintered rocks and icecrags overhead many of the tones soft and low and flutelike as if each leaf and tree crag and spire were a tuned reed a broad torrent draining the side of the glacier now swollen by scores of new streams from the mountains was rolling boulders along its rocky channel with thudding bumping muffled sounds rushing toward the bay with tremendous energy as if in haste to get out of the mountains the winters above and beneath calling to each other and all to the ocean their home
looking southward from our shelter we had this great torrent and the forested mountain wall above it on our left the spiry icecrags on our right and smooth gray gloom ahead i tried to draw the marvelous scene in my notebook but the rain blurred the page in spite of all my pains to shelter it and the sketch was almost worthless when the wind began to abate i traced the east side of the glacier all the trees standing on the edge of the woods were barked and bruised showing highice mark in a very telling way while tens of thousands of those that had stood for centuries on the bank of the glacier farther out lay crushed and being crushed in many places i could see down fifty feet or so beneath the margin of the glaciermill where trunks from one to two feet in diameter here being ground to pulp against outstanding rockribs and bosses of the bank

about three miles above the front of the glacier i climbed to the surface of it by means of axesteps made easy for stickeen as far as the eye could reach the level or nearly level glacier stretched away indefinitely beneath the gray sky a seemingly boundless prairie of ice the rain continued and grew colder which i did not mind but a dim snowy look in the drooping clouds made me hesitate about venturing far from land no trace of the west shore was visible and in case the clouds would settle and give snow or the wind again become violent i feared getting caught in a tangle of crevasses snowcrystals the flowers of the mountain clouds are frail beautiful things but terrible then flying on stormwinds in darkening benumbing swarms or when welded together into glaciers full of deadly crevasses watching the weather i sauntered about on the crystal sea for a mile or so out i found the ice remarkably safe the marginal crevasses mere mostly narrow while the few wider ones were easily avoided by passing around them and the clouds began to open here and there

thus encouraged i at last pushed out for the other side for nature can make us do anything she likes at first we made rapid progress and the sky was not very threatening while i took bearings occasionally with a pocket compass to enable me to find my way back more surely in case the storm should become blinding but the structure lines of the glacier were my main guide toward the west side we came to a closely crevassed section in which we had to make long narrow tacks and doublings tracing the edges of tremendous traverse and longitudinal crevasses many of which were from twenty to thirty feet wide and perhaps a thousand feet deepbeautiful and awful in working a way through them i was severely cautious but stickeen came on as unhesitating as the flying clouds the widest crevasse that i could jump he would leap without so much as halting to take a look at it the weather was now making quick changes scattering bits of dazzling brightness through the wintry gloom at rare intervals when the sun broke forth wholly free the glacier was seen from shore to shore with a bright array of encompassing mountains partly revealed wearing the clouds as garments while the prairie bloomed and sparkled with irised light from myriads of washed crystals then suddenly all the glorious show would be darkened and blotted out

stickeen seemed to care for none of these things bright or dark nor for the crevasses wells moulins or swift flashing streams into which he might fall the little adventurer was only about two years old yet nothing seemed novel to him nothing daunted him he showed neither caution nor curiosity wonder nor fear but bravely trotted on as if glaciers were playgrounds his stout muffled body seemed all one skipping muscle and it was truly wonderful to see how swiftly and to all appearance heedlessly he flashed across nervetrying chasms six or eight feet wide his courage was so unwavering that it seemed to be due to dullness of perception as if he were only blindly bold and i kept warning him to be careful for we had been close companions on so many wilderness trips that i had formed the habit of talking to him as if he were a boy and understood every word

we gained the west shore in about three hours the width of the glacier here being about seven miles then i pushed northward in order to see as far back as possible into the fountains of the fairweather mountains in case the clouds should rise the walking was easy along the margin of the forest which of course like that on the other side had been invaded and crushed by the swollen overflowing glacier in an hour or so after passing a massive headland we came suddenly on a branch of the glacier which in the form of a magnificent icecascade two miles wide was pouring over the rim of the main basin in a westerly direction its surface broken into waveshaped blades and shattered blocks suggesting the wildest updashing heaving plunging motion of a great river cataract tracing it down three or four miles i found that it discharged into a lake filling it with icebergs 

i would gladly have followed the lake outlet to tidewater but the day was already far spent and the threatening sky called for haste on the return trip to get off the ice before dark i decided therefore to go no farther and after taking a general view of the wonderful region turned back hoping to see it again under more favorable auspices we made good speed up the cañon of the great icetorrent and out on the main glacier until we had left the west shore about two miles behind us here we got into a difficult network of crevasses the gathering clouds began to drop misty fringes and soon the dreaded snow came flying thick and fast i now began to feel anxious about finding a way in the blurring storm stickeen showed no trace of fear he was still the same silent able little hero i noticed however that after the stormdarkness came on he kept close up behind me the snow urged us to make still greater haste but at the same time hid our way i pushed on as best i could jumping innumerable crevasses and for every hundred rods or so of direct advance traveling a mile in doubling up and down in the turmoil of chasms and dislocated iceblocks after an hour or two of this work we came to a series of longitudinal crevasses of appalling width and almost straight and regular in trend like immense furrows these i traced with firm nerve excited and strengthened by the danger making wide jumps poising cautiously on their dizzy edges after cutting hollows for my feet before making the spring to avoid possible slipping or any uncertainty on the farther sides where only one trial is grantedexercise at once frightful and inspiring stickeen followed seemingly without effort

many a mile we thus traveled mostly up and down making but little real headway in crossing running instead of walking most of the time as the danger of being compelled to spend the night on the glacier became threatening stickeen seemed able for anything doubtless we could have weathered the storm for one night dancing on a flat spot to keep from freezing and i faced the threat without feeling anything like despair but we were hungry and wet and the wind from the mountains was still thick with snow and bitterly cold so of course that night would have seemed a very long one i could not see far enough through the blurring snow to judge in which general direction the least dangerous route lay while the few dim momentary glimpses i caught of mountains through rifts in the flying clouds were far from encouraging either as weather signs or as guides i had simply to grope my way from crevasse to crevasse holding a general direction by the icestructure which was not to be seen everywhere and partly by the wind again and again i was put to my mettle but stickeen followed easily his nerve apparently growing more unflinching as the danger increased so it always is with mountaineers when hard beset running hard and jumping holding every minute of the remaining daylight poor as it was precious we doggedly persevered and tried to hope that every difficult crevasse we overcame would prove to be the last of its kind but on the contrary as we advanced they became more deadly trying

at length our way was barred by a very wide and straight crevasse which i traced rapidly northward a mile or so without finding a crossing or hope of one then down the glacier about as far to where it united with another uncrossable crevasse in all this distance of perhaps two miles there was only one place where i could possibly jump it but the width of this jump was the utmost i dared attempt while the danger of slipping on the farther side was so great that i was loath to try it furthermore the side i was on was about a foot higher than the other and even with this advantage the crevasse seemed dangerously wide one is liable to underestimate the width of crevasses where the magnitudes in general are great i therefore stared at this one mighty keenly estimating its width and the shape of the edge on the farther side until i thought that i could jump it if necessary but that in case i should be compelled to jump back from the lower side i might fail now a cautious mountaineer seldom takes a step on unknown ground which seems at all dangerous that he cannot retrace in case he should be stopped by unseen obstacles ahead this is the rule of mountaineers who live long and though in haste i compelled myself to sit down and calmly deliberate before i broke it

retracing my devious path in imagination as if it were drawn on a chart i saw that i was recrossing the glacier a mile or two farther up stream than the course pursued in the morning and that i was now entangled in a section i had not before seen should i risk this dangerous jump or try to regain the woods on the west shore make a fire and have only hunger to endure while waiting for a new day i had already crossed so broad a stretch of dangerous ice that i saw it would be difficult to get back to the woods through the storm before dark and the attempt would most likely result in a dismal nightdance on the glacier while just beyond the present barrier the surface seemed more promising and the east shore was now perhaps about as near as the west i was therefore eager to go on but this wide jump was a dreadful obstacle

at length because of the dangers already behind me i determined to venture against those that might he ahead jumped and landed well but with so little to spare that i more than ever dreaded being compelled to take that jump back from the lower side stickeen followed making nothing of it and we ran eagerly forward hoping we were leaving all our troubles behind but within the distance of a few hundred yards we were stopped by the widest crevasse yet encountered of course i made haste to explore it hoping all might yet be remedied by finding a bridge or a way around either end about three fourths of a mile up stream i found that it united with the one we had just crossed as i feared it would then tracing it down i found it joined the same crevasse at the lower end also maintaining throughout its whole course a width of forty to fifty feet thus to my dismay i discovered that we were on a narrow island about two miles long with two barely possible ways to escape one back by the way we came the other ahead by an almost inaccessible sliverbridge that crossed the great crevasse from near the middle of it

after this nervetrying discovery i ran back to the sliverbridge and cautiously examined it crevasses caused by strains from variations in the rate of motion of different parts of the glacier and convexities in the channel are mere cracks when they first open so narrow as hardly to admit the blade of a pocketknife and gradually widen according to the extent of the strain and the depth of the glacier now some of these cracks are interrupted like the cracks in wood and in the opening the strip of ice between overlapping ends is dragged out and may maintain a continuous connection between the side just as the two sides of a slivered crack in wood that is being split are connected some crevasses remain open for months or even years and by the melting of their sides continue to increase in width long after the opening strain has ceased while the sliverbridges level on top at first and perfectly safe are at length melted to thin vertical knifeedged blades the upper portion being most exposed to the weather and since the exposure is greatest in the middle they at length curve downward like the cables of suspension bridges this one was evidently very old for it had been weathered and wasted until it was the most dangerous and inaccessible that ever lay in my way the width of the crevasse was here about fifty feet and the sliver crossing diagonally was about seventy feet long its thin knifeedge near the middle was depressed twentyfive or thirty feet below the level of the glacier and the upcurving ends were attached to the sides eight or ten feet below the brink getting down the nearly vertical wall to the end of the sliver and up the other side were the main difficulties and they seemed all but insurmountable of the many perils encountered in my years of wandering on mountains and glaciers none seemed so plain and stern and merciless as this and it was presented when we were wet to the skin and hungry the sky dark with quick driving snow and the night near but we were forced to face it it was a tremendous necessity

beginning not immediately above the sunken end of the bridge but a little to one side i cut a deep hollow on the brink for my knees to rest in then leaning over with my shorthandled axe i cut a step sixteen or eighteen inches below which on account of the sheerness of the wall was necessarily shallow that step however was well made its floor sloped slightly inward and formed a good hold for my heels then slipping cautiously upon it and crouching as low as possible with my left side toward the wall i steadied myself against the wind with my left hand in a slight notch while with the right i cut other similar steps and notches in succession guarding against losing balance by glinting of the axe or by windgusts for life and death were in every stroke and in the niceness of finish of every foothold

after the end of the bridge was reached i chipped it down until i had made a level platform six or eight inches wide and it was a trying thing to poise on this little slippery platform while bending over to get safely astride of the sliver crossing was then comparatively easy by chipping off the sharp edge with short careful strokes and hitching forward an inch or two at a time keeping my balance with my knees pressed against the sides the tremendous abyss on either hand i studiously ignored to me the edge of that blue sliver was then all the world but the most trying part of the adventure after working my way across inch by inch and chipping another small platform was to rise from the safe position astride and to cut a stepladder in the nearly vertical face of the wallchipping climbing holding on with feet and fingers in mere notches at such times ones whole body is eye and common skill and fortitude are replaced by power beyond our call or knowledge never before had i been so long under deadly strain how i got up that cliff i never could tell the thing seemed to have been done by somebody else i never have held death in contempt though in the course of my explorations i have oftentimes felt that to meet ones fate on a noble mountain or in the heart of a glacier would be blessed as compared with death from disease or from some shabby lowland accident but the best death quick and crystalpure set so glaringly open before us is hard enough to face even though we feel gratefully sure that we have already had happiness enough for a dozen lives
but poor stickeen the wee hairy sleekit beastie think of him when i had decided to dare the bridge and while i was on my knees chipping a hollow on the rounded brow above it he came behind me pushed his head past my shoulder looked down and across scanned the sliver and its approaches with his mysterious eyes then looked me in the face with a startled air of surprise and concern and began to mutter and whine saying as plainly as if speaking with words surely you are not going into that awful place this was the first time i had seen him gaze deliberately into a crevasse or into my face with an eager speaking troubled look that he should have recognized and appreciated the danger at the first glance showed wonderful sagacity never before had the daring midget seemed to know that ice was slippery or that there was any such thing as danger anywhere his looks and tones of voice when he began to complain and speak his fears were so human that i unconsciously talked to him in sympathy as i would to a frightened boy and in trying to calm his fears perhaps in some measure moderated my own hush your fears my boy i said we will get across safe though it is not going to be easy no right way is easy in this rough world we must risk our lives to save them at the worst we can only slip and then how grand a grave we will have and by and by our nice bones will do good in the terminal moraine

but my sermon was far from reassuring him he began to cry and after taking another piercing look at the tremendous gulf ran away in desperate excitement seeking some other crossing by the time he got back baffled of course i had made a step or two i dared not look back but he made himself heard and when he saw that i was certainly bent on crossing he cried aloud in despair the danger was enough to haunt anybody but it seems wonderful that he should have been able to weight and appreciate it so justly no mountaineer could have seen it more quickly or judged it more wisely discriminating between real and apparent peril

when i gained the other side he screamed louder than ever and after running back and forth in vain search for a way of escape he would return to the brink of the crevasse above the bridge moaning and wailing as if in the bitterness of death could this be the silent philosophic stickeen i shouted encouragement telling him the bridge was not so bad as it looked that i had left it flat and safe for his feet and he could walk it easily but he was afraid to try strange so small an animal should be capable of such big wise fears i called again and again in a reassuring tone to come on and fear nothing that he could come if he would only try he would hush for a moment look down again at the bridge and shout his unshakable conviction that he could never never come that way then lie back in despair as if howling oooh what a place nooo i can never gooo down there his natural composure and courage had vanished utterly in a tumultuous storm of fear had the danger been less his distress would have seemed ridiculous but in this dismal merciless abyss lay the shadow of death and his heartrending cries might well have called heaven to his help perhaps they did so hidden before he was now transparent and one could see the workings of his heart and mind like the movements of a clock out of its case his voice and gestures hopes and fears were so perfectly human that none could mistake them while he seemed to understand every word of mine i was troubled at the thought of having to leave him out all night and of the danger of not finding him in the morning it seemed impossible to get him to venture to compel him to try through fear of being abandoned i started off as if leaving him to his fate and disappeared back of a hummock but this did no good he only lay down and moaned ill utter hopeless misery so after hiding a few minutes i went back to the brink of the crevasse and in a severe tone of voice shouted across to him that now i must certainly leave him i could wait no longer and that if he would not come all i could promise was that i would return to seek him next day i warned him that if he went back to the woods the wolves would kill him and finished by urging him once more by words and gestures to come on come on

he knew very well what i meant and at last with the courage of despair hushed and breathless he crouched down on the brink in the hollow i had made for my knees pressed his body against the ice as if trying to get the advantage of the friction of every hair gazed into the first step put his little feet together and slid them slowly slowly over the edge and down into it bunching all four in it and almost standing on his head then without lifting his feet as well as i could see through the snow he slowly worked them over the edge of the step and down into the next and the next in succession in the same way and gained the end of the bridge then lifting his feet with the regularity and slowness of the vibrations of a seconds pendulum as if counting and measuring onetwothree  holding himself steady against the gusty wind and giving separate attention to each little step he gained the foot of the cliff while i was on my knees leaning over to give him a lift should he succeed in getting within reach of my arm here he halted in dead silence and it was here i feared he might fail for dogs are poor climbers i had no cord if i had had one i would have dropped a noose over his head and hauled him up but while i was thinking whether an available cord might be made out of clothing he was looking keenly into the series of notched steps and fingerholds i had made as if counting them and fixing the position of each one of them in his mind then suddenly up he came in a springy rush hooking his paws into the steps and notches so quickly that i could not see how it was done and whizzed past my head safe at last

and now came a scene well done well done little boy brave boy i cried trying to catch and caress him but he would not be caught never before or since have i seen anything like so passionate a revulsion from the depths of despair to exultant triumphant uncontrollable joy he flashed and darted hither and thither as if fairly demented screaming and shouting swirling round and round in giddy loops and circles like a leaf in a whirlwind lying down and rolling over and over sidewise and heels over head and pouring forth a tumultuous flood of hysterical cries and sobs and gasping mutterings when i ran up to him to shake him fearing he might die of joy he flashed off two or three hundred yards his feet in a mist of motion then turning suddenly came back in a wild rush and launched himself at my face almost knocking me down all the while screeching and screaming and shouting as if saying saved saved saved then away again dropping suddenly at times with his feet in the air trembling and fairly sobbing such passionate emotion was enough to kill him moses stately song of triumph after escaping the egyptians and the red sea was nothing to it who could have guessed the capacity of the dull enduring little fellow for all that most stirs this mortal frame nobody could have helped crying with him

but there is nothing like work for toning down excessive fear or joy so i ran ahead calling him in as gruff a voice as i could command to come on and stop his nonsense for we had far to go and it would soon he dark neither of us feared another trial like this heaven would surely count one enough for a lifetime the ice ahead was gashed by thousands of crevasses but they were common ones the joy of deliverance burned in us like fire and we ran without fatigue every muscle with immense rebound glorying in its strength stickeen flew across everything in his way and not till dark did he settle into his normal foxlike trot at last the cloudy mountains came in sight and we soon felt the solid rock beneath our feet and were safe then came weakness danger had vanished and so had our strength we tottered down the lateral moraine in the dark over boulders and tree trunks through the bushes and devilclub thickets of the grove where we had sheltered ourselves in the morning and across the level mudslope of the terminal moraine we reached camp about ten oclock and found a big fire and a big supper a party of hoona indians had visited mr young bringing a gift of porpoise meat and wild strawberries and hunter joe had brought in a wild goat but we lay down too tired to eat much and soon fell into a troubled sleep the man who said the harder the toil the sweeter the rest never was profoundly tired stickeen kept springing up and muttering in his sleep no doubt dreaming that he was still on the brink of the crevasse and so did i that night and many others long afterward when i was overtired

thereafter stickeen was a changed dog during the rest of the trip instead of holding aloof he always lay by my side tried to keep me constantly in sight and would hardly accept a morsel of food however tempting from any hand but mine at night when all was quiet about the campfire he would come to me and rest his head on my knee with a look of devotion as if i were his god and often as he caught my eye he seemed to be trying to say wasnt that an awful time we had together on the glacier

nothing in after years has dimmed that alaska stormday as i write it all comes rushing and roaring to mind as if i were again in the heart of it again i see the gray flying clouds with their rainfloods and snow the icecliffs towering above the shrinking forest the majestic icecascade the vast glacier outspread before its white mountainfountains and in the heart of it the tremendous crevasseemblem of the valley of the shadow of deathlow clouds trailing over it the snow falling into it and on its brink i see little stickeen and i hear his cries for help and his shouts of joy i have known many dogs and many a story i could tell of their wisdom and devotion but to none do i owe so much as to stickeen at first the least promising and least known of my dogfriends he suddenly became the best known of them all our stormbattle for life brought him to light and through him as through a window i have ever since been looking with deeper sympathy into all my fellow mortals

none of stickeens friends knows what finally became of him after my work for the season was done i departed for california and i never saw the dear little fellow again in reply to anxious inquiries his master wrote me that in the summer of 1883 he was stolen by a tourist at fort wrangell and taken away on a steamer his fate is wrapped in mystery doubtless he has left this worldcrossed the last crevasseand gone to another but he will not be forgotten to me stickeen is immortalembed"
