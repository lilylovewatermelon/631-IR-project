ahhhh
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here

verse 1
id like to think that all of this constant interaction
is just the kind to make you drive yourself away
each simple gesture done by me is counteracted
and leaves me standing here with nothing else to say
completely baffled by a backward indication
that an inspired word will come across your tongue
hands moving upward to propel the situation
have simply halted
now the conversations done

chorus
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here

verse 2
im only waiting for the proper time to tell you
that its impossible to get along with you
its hard to look you in the face when we are talking
so it helps to have a mirror in the room
ive not been really looking forward to the performance
but theres my cue and theres a question on your face
fortunately i have come across an answer
which is go away
and do not leave a trace

bridge
waking up for breakfast
burning matches
talking quickly
breaking baubles
throwing garbage
drinking soda
looking happy
taking pictures
so completely stupid
just go away
ahhhh

chorus
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here
theres no home for you here girl go away
theres no home for you here4embed"
