verse 1
ayo tonight is the night that ima get twisted
myx moscato and vodka ima mix it
roll that spaceship we bout to get lifted
live in the present that gift is for the gifted
this what you came this what you came for
you get what you buy this what you paid for
so make sure the stars is what you aim for
make mistakes though

prechorus
i never worry life is a journey
i just wanna enjoy the ride
what is the hurry its pretty early
its okay well take our time

chorus
the night is still young
the night is still young
the night is still young
and so are we
the night is still young how dare we sit quietly
the night is still young and watch the world pass us by
the night is still young how dare we sit quietly
