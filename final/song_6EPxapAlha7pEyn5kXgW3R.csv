i got in trouble
the first time my dad saw me
dance with the devil
how are we so opposite
i lived with your sister
my first home since mom had left
and i wrote my first song with him in the basement

prechorus
and then he said goodbye way too soon
and this dont feel right without you

chorus
lonely lonely even when the room is full
id trade it trade it i would trade it all for you
lonely lonely even when the room is full
im lonely lonely lonely without you

verse 2
i got in trouble
the first time the cops saw me
dance with the devil
i ended up in handcuffs and then
you called your sister
she cried when she picked me up
goddamn how i miss her
cause she didnt give a fuck

boy it was just a dangerous birth
his umbilical cord was stuck around his neck
and so i ended up uh undoing the umbilical cord and uh
well he was bigger than the normal child
