how cruel is the golden rule
when the lives we lived are only goldenplated

prechorus
and i knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me
though i carried carats for everyone to see

chorus
and i saw god cry in the reflection of my enemies
and all the lovers with no time for me
and all of the mothers raise their babies
to stay away from me

verse 2
tongues on the sockets of electric dreams
where the sewage of youth drowned the spark of my teens

prechorus
and i knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me too heavy for me
though i carried carats for everyone to see everyone to see

chorus
and i saw god cry in the reflection of my enemies
and all the lovers with no time for me
and all of the mothers raise their babies
to stay away from me
