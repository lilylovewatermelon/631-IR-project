so now youll know exactly what it feels like
to be an obstacle in my way
you wont remain
you wont remain

verse
save your breath
dont even speak if youll speak of change
cause you wont you wont
cut to the chase
spare me the lecture on what it takes to make a man
cause youre weak and im strong

prechorus
i will never falter ill stand my ground
youre a fake a worthless coward
your life wont mean anything
i will never falter ill stand my ground
youre a fake a worthless coward
your life wont mean anything

chorus
so now youll know exactly what it feels like
to be an obstacle in my way
you wont remain
you wont remain

lets set things straight
whats done is done i never needed you
tell me exactly who you think that youre kidding
everyone will be happy when they find that youre missing
you asked if wed ever forget you
weve got our fingers crossed
our fingers crossed
