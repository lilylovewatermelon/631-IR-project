daddy whats a will

verse 1 jayz
take those monies and spread cross families
my sisters hattie and lou the nephews cousins and tt
eric the rest to b for whatever she wants to do
she might start an institute she might put poor kids through school
my stake in roc nation should go to you
leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too
tidal the champagne dussé id like to see
a nice peacefund ideas from people who look like we
we gon start a society within a society
thats major just like the negro league
there was a time america wouldnt let us ball
those times are now back just now called afrotech
generational wealth thats the key
my parents aint have shit so that shift started with me
my mom took her money she bought me bonds
that was the sweetest thing of all time uh

i remember like listenin to wutang
and niggas like your seed married his seed married my seed

verse 2 jayz
you see my father son of a preacher man
whose daughter couldnt escape the reach of the preachers hand
that charge of energy set all the carters back
it took all these years to get to zero in fact
i hated religion cause here was this christian
he was preachin on sundays versus how he was livin monday
someday i forgive him
cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
i studied muslim buddhist and christians
and i was runnin from him he was givin me wisdom
see how the universe works
it takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
its a gift and a curse
thats called the red queens race

bridge jayz
you run this hard just to stay in place
keep up the pace baby
keep up the pace
you run this hard just to stay in place
