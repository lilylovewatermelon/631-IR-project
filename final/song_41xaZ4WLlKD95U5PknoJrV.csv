youre a master of passiveaggressive magic tricks
like thats not a card that i wouldve picked but its your life to live like how youd like to live
youre type of cool that likes to talk a lot
im the type of fool to listen
they say a wise man lends his ears but not his thoughts often
the same is true of undercover cops

and the undercover bubbler got me doubly high as heaven
were still under the radar seven billion on the planet
wading straight to the moon
salutations to apollo
while the mission to mars is surely soon to follow
and you bit my lip when i kissed you
i bit my tongue not to tell you that i miss you
we shared my blood for an instant and i would trade some more to have it back
yeah i would trade all of this for that

im in the back of a fifteen passenger van doing an expose on feelings i dont fully understand
started a matchbox guitar slow jam
with hope just as large as the room in my car
my career went as far as the can that i kicked down the road for awhile until im just settled in
hold it for change from charitable donors like
excuse me sir miss could you spare a moment to

support local support local
i know i shouldve been more vocal
sure i couldve been more social
ive been hanging out its a short rope though
its been awhile i shouldve wrote but im going postal
im going postal
ive been coasting
ive been coping okay for the most part
you might also likeeverybody i know wants to be a star
just above the atmosphere flying high
just above the average fear to try
keeping me grounded holding me down for miles
everybody i know wants the gleam
in designer tops and ten dollar magazines
infatuated with the beams you go crazy when i speak
aggravated when i say what i mean
i mean i mean

you see is that
im a master of matchbox guitar sessions
youre a master of passive aggressive magic tricks
like thats not the card that i wouldve picked but its your life to live like youd like to live
youre the master of matlock lock picking lessons
im the asshole who keeps laughing at our predicaments
like this aint the life that i shouldve picked
but its the cards were dealt we play with
