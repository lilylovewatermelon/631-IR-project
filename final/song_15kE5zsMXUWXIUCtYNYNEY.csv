for once my eyes are open to you and everything youve said
for once your web of lies is in the open
i gave you everything i had until i had nothing left
now still you act as if im just a burden ive finally let go

prechorus
let go let go

chorus
stay silent at least for now
and let me move on cause im so done
playing these games with my heart ive been around the world
and back for you and now its time to choose

verse 2
ive been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life
im damaged from the inside ive been broken
dont threaten me with what you think i feel
if you could read my mind youd be in tears

breakdown
im sick of your excuses you hold above me
ive finally come to terms with what i am
im nothing in your eyes and this will not change
im living in a dream
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus
stay silent at least for now
and let me move on cause im so done
playing these games with my heart ive been around the world
and back for you and now its time to choose

bridge
and ill close my eyes and dream of a better time
when ill be finally past this and ill be happy on my own
ive done all i can and ive still been cast aside all i ever wanted to
be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes but i
guess ill play second best to a world that will never care about
you youll never understand youre just another pretty face
youll tell me that you care and then run straight back to him
i can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

spoken bridge
you never did know how to whisper

outro
youre such a liar tell me the truth
youre such a liar tell me the truth
youre such a liar tell me the truth
do the world a favor stop cutting your arms and slit your throat2embed"
