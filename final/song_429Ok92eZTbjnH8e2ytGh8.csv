i always thought that whiskey was just somethin that you sipped
i always thought a smoke was somethin’ id never do again
i thought i was in control
and i was on a roll

verse 2
i never thought a picture was enough to break me down
i never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown
or how lonely lonely sounds
but man i get it now

chorus
im learnin’ somethin new every day
all about goodbyes about overs
all about hangups and hangovers
things i never knew about me
im findin out now since the
day you made us go our separate ways
well im learnin somethin new every day

verse 3
i thought i knew it all but girl i guess youre showin’ me
i’m findin out how freedom can feel anything but free
and how hurtin’ hurts like hell
yeah as far as i can tell
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
im learnin somethin new every day
all about goodbyes about overs
all about hangups and hangovers
things i never knew about me
i’m findin out now since the
day you made us go our separate ways
well im learnin somethin new every day

bridge
soon as its gone i find out
your memory is still around
and here to stay

chorus
well im learnin somethin new every day
all about goodbyes about overs
all about hangups and hangovers
things i never knew about me
im findin out now since the
day you made us go our separate ways
well im learnin somethin new
i guess you could say
that im learnin somethin new every day
