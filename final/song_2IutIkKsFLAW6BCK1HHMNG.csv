told me you love me but obviously you dont
i told you i need you but you wasnt there for me no

verse 1
money callin gotta go get it baby
confident how i been feelin lately
i cannot sit here just stress about our situation
i just gotta look at the bigger picture baby
but on the upper end i been gettin it in
low lights stacking up my m’s and thats til the end
i done cut off all my friends gotta stay positive
i wont let nobody hurt me or get me up outta here
they say money’ll make you change and i agree
most of them niggas caught up in they fame but that aint me
im sittin on top of the peak my heart forever in the streets
cant believe you turned your back on me

chorus
told me you love me but obviously you dont
i told you i need you
but you wasnt there for me no
i can promise you i wont change
i can promise you i wont change
yeah yeah

heard you been fuckin with them lames heard you been fuckin with em
i heard that you been man to man i knew you wasnt official
i had to get up off my ass had to get up and get it
and i done ran me up a bag for me and my children

every night runnin it with fat black he say im that nigga
he say if they left they were never with you
ai youngboy im too official
every night runnin it with fat black he say im that nigga
he say if they left they were never with you

chorus
