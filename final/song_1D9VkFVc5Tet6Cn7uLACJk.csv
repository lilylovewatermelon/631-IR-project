from underneath you staring at the ceiling
theres another world of chocolate bars and baseball cards
that hides inside of all this tension that im feeling

but its all inside of you
yeah its all inside of you

surprise surprise
i miss your hair
you miss my eyes
and all this solitude is my confidence eroding
so we slide inside of someones mouth and someones eyes
until theres the sound of something intimate exploding

but its all inside of you
yeah its all inside of you
oh its all inside of you
yeah its all inside of you

i wish that i was anesthetized and sterilized
and then we wouldnt have this evidence congealing
surprise surprise
another pair of lips and eyes
and that is the consequence of actually feeling

it was all inside of you
it was all inside of you
it was all inside of youembed"
