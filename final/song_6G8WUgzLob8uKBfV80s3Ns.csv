billys leaving today
dont know where hes going
holds his head in disgrace
he cant escape the truth
he knows the price that hes paid
he admits that its too late to admit that hes afraid

chorus
tomorrow comes
sorrow becomes his soul mate
the damage is done
the prodigal son is too late
old doors are closed but hes always open
to relive time in his mind
oh billy

verse 2
billys leaving today
dont know where hes going
hes got lines on his face
they tell the story of his pain
he accepts its his fate
he admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong

chorus
tomorrow comes
sorrow becomes his soul mate
the damage is done
the prodigal son is too late
old doors are closed but hes always open
to relive time in his mind
oh billy

once he was a lover sleeping with another
now hes just known as a cheat
and he wish hed had a mirror
looked a little clearer
seen into the eyes of the weak
once he was a lover sleeping with another
now hes just known as a cheat
and he wish hed had a mirror
looked a little clearer
seen into the eyes of the weak

chorus
tomorrow comes
sorrow becomes his soul mate
the damage is done
the prodigal son is too late
old doors are closed but hes always open
to relive time in his mind
