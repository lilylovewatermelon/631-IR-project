step out the door and it feels like rain
thats the sound thats the sound on your window pane
take to the streets but you cant ignore
thats the sound thats the sound youre waiting for

prechorus
if ever your world starts crashing down
whenever your world starts crashing down
whenever your world starts crashing down
thats where youll find me

verse 2
yeah god love your soul and your aching bones
take a breath take a step meet me down below
everyones the same our fingers to our toes
we just cant get it right but were on the road

prechorus
if ever your world starts crashing down
whenever your world starts crashing down
whenever your world starts crashing down
thats where youll find me yeah

chorus
lost til youre found
swim til you drown

love til you hate
strong til you break
