i dont know your face no more
or feel the touch that i adore
i dont know your face no more
its just a place im looking for

chorus
we might as well be strangers in another town
we might as well be living in a different world
we might as well we might as well
we might as well

verse 2
i dont know your thoughts these days
were strangers in an empty space
i dont understand your heart
its easier to be apart

chorus
we might as well be strangers in another town
we might as well be living in another time
we might as well we might as well
we might as well
