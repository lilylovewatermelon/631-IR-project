i thought you and me were something special
thought you thought that way too
now i know that this old boy just aint the
best you think youll ever do

chorus
it aint cool to be crazy about you
it aint suave or debonair
to let you know i care like i do
it aint smart to be so reckless with my heart
i should have known right from the start
id end up like a fool believe me it aint cool

verse 2
all of my friends they tried to tell me
what and what not to do
it took a while for them to sell me
but finally they got through

chorus
it aint cool to be crazy about you
it aint suave or debonair
to let you know i care like i do
it aint smart to be so reckless with my heart
i should have known right from the start
id end up like a fool believe me it aint coolsee george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also like1embed"
