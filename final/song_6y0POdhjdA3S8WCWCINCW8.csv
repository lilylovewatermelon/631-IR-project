crooked smiles with their twisted mouths
i know what yall are laughin bout
i shout for the sandman to come out the clouds
annihilate the crowd without a sound
a pile of dust can try and hate me
but lately ive been feelin like my enemies evaporating
i am creating my own nemesis from all of the shit i hate bout myself
i will raise him in the pits of hell let him dwell in the poison
as well as he sells me my soul back i swallow it whole
i got a stack of them shits in the back of the sticks
me and lick got the crucifix picked
set fire to liars and then they get zipped
the higher i get the more i start to drift

verse 2 yung heath ledger
im burnin the city and producing toxins life aint no option
im on suboxone fucking rottenâ€”but fuck that topic
seeing you like optics in my vision cut the incision
with no deliverance say your penance got no provisions
kill em all they call me chucky blade up in my hand
murder murder bitch my life is lived up on the lamb
rising up from hell revelations in the flesh
always looking friendly till i grip the fucking tecsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like18embed"
