tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
now weve been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
he lives in a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord

verse 1 kanye west
sittin by myself im just thinkin
about all ive been through i wish i was dreamin
man its hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons jesus
i watched so many people leave lord
i see em change by the season thats mamas sеasonin
god got you the devils watchin he just peekin in
i know i madе a promise that id never let the reaper in jesus
but lately ive been losin all my deepest friends lord
and lately ive been swimmin on the deepest end
its just drugs it aint no hugs it aint no love there
you been down so much you dont even know whats upstairs jesus
suicidal thoughts got you wonderin whats up there lord
and while i introduce the party you say its up there
too many pills so much potions so much pain too many emotions
and everything that you do good it just go unnoticed jesus
did he tell you that you good and just stay focused lord
mama you was the life of the party
i swear you brought life to the party
when you lost your life it took the life out the party jesus
that woman rode with me like a harley lord
visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
movin to the hood was like signin up for the army
cause they been killin  since  was watchin barney jesus
you want dreams to come true but i have nightmares lord
cause if that come to life then i might not be right here
been in the dark so long dont know if the light here
but im just reaching for the stars like buzz lightyear jesus
and now im lightyears ahead of those nightmares lord
i deaded those night terrors when the night clears
and if i talk to christ can i bring my mother back to life
and if i die tonight will i see her in the afterlife jesus
but back to reality where everythings a tragedy lord
you better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
little boy dies hes just one of the mystic
and mama steady crying cause she really the victim jesus
and shes getting high and shes getting addicted lord
and her older boy just stuck with the picture painted vivid
thats a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
sixteen pregnant baby daddy say she should abort it jesus
but we cant afford it so she decides to move forward lord
baby shower time father didnt show up
now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
the water flows down her legs yeah its finna go up jesus
a year done went by her daughter just turned one lord
and shes still dependent on her mom
big brother in the streets he went and bought him a gun
he want revenge cause the pain feelin numb jesus
and her mom still doing drugs cause thats the only time she feel loved lord
is it real love do the scars really heal up
from all the pain that done built up but they dont feel us jesus
a week done flew by big bro ridin then he see the guys lord
left his little brother on the side bleeding from the side
he seein red its like hes bleeding through his eyes
to see him dead the only thing thatll help the grieving up inside jesus
even let him get the last meal
he done with the streets after this this his last kill lord
he gotta show him that its that real
he ran up on him with the pipe like  stand still jesus
you took my brother life you made my mother cry lord
tell me one reason i shouldnt send you up to christ
he said go head take my life ive seen everything but christ
then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light jesus lord

verse 2 jay electronica
uhhuh in the name of the true and living god the beneficent the merciful hallelujah
thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like ertuğrul jesus
every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage lord
to the monk who visited rothschilds like thelonious did pannonica shoo
its jay elecentendrenica comin through your monitor
back from the great beyond like the son of man or the son of donda jesus
i never rolled the gsxr or the r6 or the honda lord
but i flew my ducati through north america like wakanda
earthquakes will strike this nation for what bush did to rwanda facts
what the clintons did to haiti and downing street did to ghana jesus
in tepoztlán they call me terremoto el negro loco lord
i shake the tectonic plates of the game if i lay one vocal
the god is interstellar while you fellas remain local
my bars is like the pyramid temples of pacal votan jesus
as sure as the doj confirmed ezekiels wheel lord
i could change the world like yacub with two pieces of steel
my sword and my microphone i swore to the christs throne
but when you great they wanna say you took a l josé castillo jesus
im in the fight here fight here for what seemed like lightyears lord
my rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out christ tears
thirty pieces of silver clout my pierre price tier
its a war outside its a war outside jesus
its like the last days of sodom and gomorrah outside lord
chorus kanye west
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
now weve been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
he lives in a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord
been through a lot of things
tell me if you know someone that needs jesus lord

outro larry hoover jr  kanye west
what up ye this larry hoover jr
first and foremost i wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the oval office
you might not have been the only one that couldve did that
but you were the one that did do that
and with your assistance we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
you know to me it kinda feels like
me my mother my brothers and my kids
have all been incarcerated through this journey
and we havent even been to jail
we have been looked at and treated as criminals
for being a part of this family
my fathers truth and the reality that he raised me in
is that he wanted to make a change in this community tell me if you know someone that needs
cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
and it is what made the children of today
after twentyfive years of bein locked down twentythree and one
my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
and will not once released call any shots for the gangster disciples
if my fathers intentions were to lead us to death destruction
into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twentysix years
man he would be dead to me
i didnt sign up for that
i didnt stay on this journey this long for that
all my life man
ive been waitin for my father to come home
they told me when i graduate eighth grade he would be home
then they told me when i graduate from high school he would be home
i went away to morris brown i graduated and he still aint home
now im a adult and my daughter went away to college and graduated
he still not home
now even more than that my son he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin
matter of fact he hasnt hugged kissed or touched any of his grandchildren
and they havent been able to touch they grandfather
even though it is not seen that way for some of us
but for many of us larry hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
who deserves to breathe free air
free my father jesus mr larry hoover sr lord64embed"
