just met a boy just met a boy when
he can come inside of my playpen
cause he look like a superstar in the making
so i think that im going in for the takin
hear through the grapevine that hes cakin
we can shoot a movie he can do the tapin
boom boom pow this thing be shakin

cause i know he got a wife at home
but i need just one night alone
if he keep playin them gggames
