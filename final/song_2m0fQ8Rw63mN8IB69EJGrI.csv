just take it all
for nothing again
create release
she just dont feel the same
i asked and you answered
but you eat your words in frame
at last discover
you cant recall my name

prechorus
dont want to let you fall away
ive been left no choice
dont you see that

chorus
you come crawling back to me
but im already on the ground
and we all know that talk is cheap
so come on and save me now
and you wonder what i believe
but you dont wanna be around
so what would you do for me
yeah what would you do for me
