verse 1 ruby da cherry
bitch i be that broke boy
two scripts halffull make a full script mean im runnin out
bitch i be a ho toy making two bad bitches bashful
comin out they nutshell pass me the rag fool
bitch i be that dope boy
smoke cash ash snowin on the broke glass
throat slashed now i got a bloodsoaked rash
go bash in a fuck boys skull wearin no mask toe tag
make the rope last dont ask
uh alall of my vices the devil
fuck all this nice shit i meddle in murderous temptation
roll up the windows and push down the pedal
burn a cigarette in my wrist that 7th ward shit
fuck a bitch then dip

keep them dead bodies all on the ground
