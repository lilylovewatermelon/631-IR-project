this that mothafuckin rider music
this that mothafuckin rider music
all night when im rollin
dirty how many times you gon play with death before you 30
but im chosen so im rollin
with 11 of my closest on a mission to get rich like danny ocean how we rollin
all through traffic with this mob apparatus
these people want me in a casket still im rollin
i heard heaven got a place for me there but i dont know if im goin uh

verse 1
smoking on sequoia running from my paranoia
hollywood want me to come and live and die in california
i aint going out like river phoenix
i wanna enjoy all of the spoils
im a golden boy like oscar de la hoya
im a soldier masked up like its the end of october
blowing doja in the streets with mannie fresh down in the nola
i done told ya when it comes to beefing i aint kosher
bought a cobra just to keep you snakes closer
i can spy a motive yall can try and clone this
get them lies quoted but him and i know this
line up my opponents hold their eyes open
rip out their hearts and let em all die soulless

all night when im rollin
dirty how many times you gon play with death before you thirty
but im chosen so im rollin

verse 2
wait i heard em say they want the old gunner
fuck em i still turn coyotes into road runners
fuck a family ill leave your ass with no brothers
it aint no love when you become a man with no mother
thats what it was
i used to get my ass beat just because for real
i ran away and hit the trap they couldnt make me budge
junior year my homie selling crack right off the bus
knew that i wasnt turning back when i got cuffed
fuck a charge this a territory yall dont wanna march
cemetery full of graves i can finish what you start
lost a milli when they sued me for a fight inside a bar
i hope you pussies think of me every time that you see the scar

verse 3
yeah 247 i keep my eyes open ready
all these signs show me they want me gone like im makaveli
on the cross when they cross me over over something so petty
kill em all even if i die like method man did in belly
i am gun kelly aint shit you can tell me
get me drunk and mad enough i go pop the trunk of the chevy
im a dad and a savage this is not an image like getty
rap for currency like im spitta andretti and let it fall like confetti
ball for my dogs that they got locked in the celly
and fuck the one that turned on me i wont ever forget it
you learn its your own homies you knew since the beginning
that see you winning and then wanna see you finished
