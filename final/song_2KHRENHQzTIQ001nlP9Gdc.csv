hey bob
im lookin at what uh jack was talkin about
and uh its definitely not a particle thats nearby
it is a uh bright object
and its uh obviously rotating because its flashing
its uh way out in the distance
currently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
because the uh flashes come around uh almost on time
as we look back at the earth its uh up at about 11 oclock
about uh well maybe ten or twelve dianrersâ€”diameters uh
i dont know whether that does you any good
but theres somethin out there
