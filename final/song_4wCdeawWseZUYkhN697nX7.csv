if i was a race car driver well id be right behind her
id be doin 90 in a 55 tryna change her mind
and if i was an airplane pilot i wouldnt need 35 thousand
id be drawin im sorry in the blue sky over i65

chorus
but if i was a bettin man
id say shes half way to birmingham
on the phone with her mom and them
cussin me to hell and back again
i bet shes got her radio on
singin somethin bout movin on
id put a hundred on her never comin back again
if i was a bettin man

verse 2
if i was a radio dj well i know the songs that id play
theyd be about comin home and makin up and fallin back in love

chorus
but if i was a bettin man
id say shes half way to birmingham
on the phone with her mom and them
cussin me to hell and back again
i bet shes got her radio on
singin somethin bout movin on
id put a hundred on her never comin back again
if i was a bettin man
if i was a bettin man

if i was a bettin man
and i wouldnt have folded that winnin hand
i wouldnt be sittin here drinkin beer
and waitin on a second chance

chorus
if i was a bettin man
id say shes half way to birmingham
on the phone with her mom and them
and cussin me to hell and back again
i bet shes got her radio on
singin somethin bout movin on
id put a hundred on her never comin back again
if i was a bettin man
id put a hundred on her never comin back again
if i was a bettin man
