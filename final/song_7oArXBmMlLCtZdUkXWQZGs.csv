one mississippi youre here
lovin me with your whole heart
and two mississippi we scream
to watch each other fall apart
three mississippi youre gone
sayin that youre done you dont want it no more
and four mississippi youre home
like nothin ever happened at all

verse 1
why do i stay i know i should leave
mascara fallin down my cheek
but you pull me in and make me forget
about the broken glass on our skin

prechorus
we dont get scared when the sirens come
a little fucked up cause we think its fun
we kiss just to make up we love just to break up
we head for disaster but live for the danger
we count

chorus
one mississippi youre here
lovin me with your whole heart
and two mississippi we scream
to watch each other fall apart
three mississippi youre gone
sayin that youre done you dont want it no more
and four mississippi youre home
like nothin ever happened at all

i like the way it hurts when you screw with my mind
