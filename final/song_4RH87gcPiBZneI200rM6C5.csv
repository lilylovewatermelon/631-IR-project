i can be your liar
i can be your bearer of bad news
sick and uninspired by
the diamonds in your fire
burning like a flame inside of you
but is this just desire or the truth

prechorus
so shame on me for the ruse
shame on me for the blues
another one returned that ill never use

chorus
i wont go gettin tired of you
i wont go gettin tired of you
im not gettin tired
i wont go gettin tired of you
i wont go gettin tired of you
im not gettin tired

verse 2
hangin on this wire
waiting for the day i have to choose
cursed by love so dire
one more boy for hire
one more boy to lend a hand to you
but is this just desire or the truth
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeprechorus
so shame on me for the ruse
shame on me for the blues
another one returned that ill never use

chorus
i wont go gettin tired of you
i wont go gettin tired of you
im not gettin tired
i wont go gettin tired of you
i wont go gettin tired of you
im not gettin tired

postchorus
