ten years ago i had to fly
been living my dream trying to stay alive
i missed my buddies i miss my home
yea i do
i aint seen my momma in way too long
give me skinny cane pole and a hot bream bed
catch me a little blue gill and a big flat head now
some fresh boiled peanuts and shrimp and grits mmm
some jack in a barrel and a hog in the pit now
need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
some black water healing some time to kill
im doing pretty good man but i aint lying
im just trying to get back to my carolina yeah
give me some beagles barking down in a hole
running a cotton till soothing my soul
i need a live oak tree and a soy bean field
i wish i could take it like a pill
need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
some black water healing some time to kill
im doing pretty good man but i aint lying
im just trying to get back to my carolina yeah
i need some dirty smoke and a jar of shine
burn my tongue and ease my mind
i need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
some black water healing some time to kill
im doing pretty good man but i aint lying
im just trying to get back to
im just trying to get back to my carolina
ten years ago i had to fly
