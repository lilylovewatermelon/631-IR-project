they say that hate has been sent
so let loose the talk of love
before they outlaw the kiss
baby give me one last hug
theres a dream that ive been chasing
want so badly for it to be reality
and when you hold my hand
then i understand that its meant to be
cause baby when youre with me

chorus
its like an angel came by and took me to heaven
like you took me to heaven girl
cause when i stare in your eyes it couldnt be better
i dont want you to go oh no so
let the music blast we gon do our dance
bring the doubters on they dont matter at all
cause this lifes too long and this loves too strong
so baby know for sure that ill never let you go

verse 2
i got my favorite girl
not feeling no pain no fear
dont have a care in the world
why would i when you are here
theres a moment ive been chasing
and i finally caught it out on this floor
baby theres no hesitation
no reservation by taking a chance and more
oh no because

its like an angel came by and took me to heaven
