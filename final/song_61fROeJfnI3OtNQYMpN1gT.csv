verse 1
you say you got a girl

the feelin is reckless of knowin its selfish
and knowin im desperate

like is you comin home is you out with her
i dont care long as you here by 1030 no later than
drop them drawers give me what i want

chorus
my man is my man is your man heard its her man too
my man is my man is your man heard thats her man
