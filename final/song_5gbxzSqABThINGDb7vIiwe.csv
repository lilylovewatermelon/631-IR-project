young and full of running
tell me where has that taken me
just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
love is really nothing
but a dream that keeps waking me
for all of my trying we still end up dying
how can it be

chorus
dont say a word just come over and lie here with me
cause im just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad ill go back on the things i believe
there i just said it im scared youll forget about me

verse 2
so young and full of running
all the way to the edge of desire
steady my breathing silently screaming
i have to have you now
wired and im tired
think ill sleep in my clothes on the floor
or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
and find me on yours

chorus
dont say a word just come over and lie here with me
cause im just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad ill go back on the things i believe
there i just said it im scared youll forget about me

chorus
dont say a word just come over and lie here with me
because im just about to set fire to everything i see
i want you so bad ill go back on the things i believe
there i just said it im scared youll forget about me16embed"
