i just read your letter it says that youll be gone for a while
everything was getting better i guess im just a fool strung out
what to do my life is through
just wanna kill myself for you
i wonder just how sympathetic youll be
youve come to take me under and ive forgotten all about me

hook
what to do my life is through
just wanna kill myself for you
so tell me why you say goodbye
and tell me why youre fucking up my whole life
yeah fucking up my whole life
so im on my way i leave today
if i get away itll be okay
itll be okay

verse 2
im looking out a window into a world thats taken you from me
and im feeling so disgusted how pathetic can i possibly be

hook
what to do my life is through
just wanna kill myself for you
so tell me why you say goodbye
and tell me why youre fucking up my whole life
yeah fucking up my whole life
so im on my way i leave today
if i get away itll be okay
itll be okay

if theres a better place you can take me
a better life you give me
whatever place i can start all over
then i would never need what you gave me
and never need you to save me
and never feel like this life is over
if theres a better place you can take me
a better life you give me
whatever place i can start all over
then i would never need what you gave me
and never need you to save me
and never feel like this life is over
feel like this life is over

hook
so im on my way i leave today
if i get away itll be okay
itll be okay2embed"
