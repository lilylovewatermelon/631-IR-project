the devil in me got an easy job
demons in my head i must confess they speak in tongues

verse 1 spooky da scary
bolts in my neck i think im frankenstein
volts to the head dont rape my mind
colt 45 to the head
see these bodies drop and you can trace the line

ruby so dizzy and gooey but still remain raw like he sushi

spooky da scary felt woozy
spooky da scary had two juicy bitches but left cause he thought they were boujee
got groupies that choose me but never fool me
thinking my life a movie

the venomous infamous sinners
gorillas that came from the river
the trigger i grip it the killer
triplesix figures ain’t nobody sicker
you call the cops i call the block
full of them kids that be rollin with chops
product of war product of life
destined for bars
suit with the stripes
ingesting the bars not to get high
just to get numb just to get by
grey and 59
