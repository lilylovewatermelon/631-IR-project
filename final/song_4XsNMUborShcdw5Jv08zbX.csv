richard manuel is dead and the daylights coming on
ive been wandering through the dark
and now im standing on the lawn

if i could give all my love to you
i could justify myself
but im just not coming through
you’re a pill to ease the pain
of all the stupid things i do
im an anchor on the line
of the clock that tells the time
that is running out on you

it was cold when i awoke
and the day was halfway done
nearly spring in san francisco
and i cannot feel the sun
you were sleeping next to me
but i knew youd be gone

if i could give all my love to you
i could justify myself
but im just not coming through
you’re a pill to ease the pain
of all the stupid things i do
im an anchor on the line
of the clock that tells the time
that is running out on you
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also liketake some time before you go
to think of mondays coming down
and the people that you knew
and the ones that arent around
youve been fading day to day
ive been moving town to town

if i could give all my love to you
i could justify myself
but im just not coming through
you’re a pill to ease the pain
of all the stupid things i do
im an anchor on the line
of the clock that tells the time
that is running out on youembed"
