dont call it a fight when you know its a war
with nothing but your tshirt on
and go sit on the bed because i know that you want to
but you got pretty eyes i know youre wrong

verse 2
and dont call it a spade if it isnt a spade
and go lie on the floor if you want
the first bit of advice that you gave me that i liked was theyre too strong too strong
get in the shower if it all goes wrong

yeah you wanna find love then you know where the city is
verse 3
yeah counting cards was the best job he ever had
cleaning up
he got good with his fours and his twos
community service was the best job he ever had
cleaning up
he got sick on the floor and his shoes
