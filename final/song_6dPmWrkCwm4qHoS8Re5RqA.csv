put the knife
in your chest
take your life

burning bright
guide your eyes
through the night

open your third eye
see through my disguise
turn the truth to lies
x i i i
let your demons die
when you sleep at night
ill be your demise
x i i i
open your third eye
see through my disguise
turn the truth to lies
x i i i
let your demons die
when you sleep at night
ill be your demise
