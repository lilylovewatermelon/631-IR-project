does he give a damn does he care who i am
im just a man is that all i am
are my manners misinterpreted words or only human
im human
murderous crow hey what you know
what you reading about what you hold in your toes
is that a twig are you a dove of peace
black dove undercover with another puzzle piece
are you a riddle to solve all along
or am i overthinking thoughts im human after all
only human made of flesh made of sand
made of human
the planets talking about a revolution
the natural laws aint got no constitution
theyve got a right to live their own life
but we keep paving over paradise
â€cause were only human
oh yes we are only human
if its our only excuse do you think well keep on being only human
oh yes we are only human so far so far
up in the majors tree
the one he planted back when he was just a boy
back in 1923
thirty meters and a foot take a look take a climb
what youll find is the product of a seed
the seed is sown all alone
it grows above with a heart of love
a sharpened shelter of
the animals of land and cold weather breathing
were all breathing
the planets talking about a revolution
the natural laws aint got no constitution
theyve got a right to live their own life
but we keep paving over paradise
â€cause were only human
oh yes we are only human
if its our only excuse do you think well keep on being only human
oh yes we are only human so far so far
and this place it will outlive me
before i get to heaven ill climb that tree
and i will have to give my thanks
for giving me the branch to swing on
if i ever fall in love
ill hope to give myself a baby
i will let my children have their way
because were only human
oh yes we are only human so far so far
so far so farsee jason mraz liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeembed"
