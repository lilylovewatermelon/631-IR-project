we got a god painted sunset view
in a barbed wire frame
its like heaven on earth down here
and that aint ever gonna change
got some gas in the tank
got a road that was made for a night like this
just a dot in the dust
one you never heard of
but its as good as it gets

chorus
they got mansions down in georgia
they got beaches in caroline
they got sunshine in california
and colorado will get you high
but i got one arm wrapped around
the prettiest thing ive evеr seen
right here in this detroit madе chevrolet
in back road tennessee

verse 2
a full moon on a night this clear
lights her blue eyes up
aint the only kind of shine around here
we got a little in a cup
a little smile takes a sip
i can taste it on her lips
when shes loving on me yeah
shes my homegrown girl
aint nowhere in the world id rather be

they got mansions down in georgia
they got beaches in caroline
they got sunshine in california
and colorado will get you high
but i got one arm wrapped around
the prettiest thing ive ever seen
right here in this detroit made chevrolet
in back road tennessee
yeah yeah uhuh

bridge
i could spend my whole life here
long as shes right here
slipping her hand in mine
born and raised this way
i swear im gonna stay small town til the day i die

chorus
they got mansions down in georgia
they got beaches in caroline
they got sunshine in california
and colorado will get you high
but i got one arm wrapped around
the prettiest thing ive ever seen
right here in this detroit made chevrolet
in back road tennesseeembed"
