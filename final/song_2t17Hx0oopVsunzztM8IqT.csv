quietly while you were asleep
the moon and i were talking
i asked that shed always keep you protected
she promised you her light
that you so gracefully carry
you bring your light and shine like morning

verse 2
and then the wind pulls the clouds across the moon
your light fills the darkest room
and i can see the miracle
that keeps us from falling

verse 3
she promised all the sweetest gifts
that only the heavens could bestow
you bring your light and shine like morning

verse 4
and as you so gracefully give
her light as long as you live
ill always remember this momentyou might also like1embed"
