you and i were friends from outer space
afraid to let go
the only two who understood this place
and as far as we know
we were way before our time
as bold as we were blind
just another perfect mistake
another bridge to take
on the way of letting go

chorus
this aint goodbye
this is just where love goes
when words arent warm enough to keep away the cold
oh no this aint goodbye
its not where our story ends
i know you cant be mine
not the way youve always been
as long as weve got time
then this aint goodbye
oh no this aint goodbye

verse 2
we were stars up in the sunlit sky
no one else could see
neither of us thought to ever ask why
it wasnt meant to be
maybe we were way too high
to ever understand
baby we were victims of all all the foolish plans
we began to divide
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likechorus
but this aint goodbye
this is just the way love goes
when words arent warm enough to keep away the cold
oh no this aint goodbye
its not where our story ends
but i know you cant be mine
not the way youve always been
as long as weve got time
this aint goodbye
oh no this aint good bye ohoh
