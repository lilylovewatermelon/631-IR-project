one fell off and bumped his head

“no more monkeys jumping on the bed”

four little monkeys jumping on the bed
one fell off and bumped his head
mama called the doctor and the doctor said
“no more monkeys jumping on the bed”

three little monkeys jumping on the bed
one fell off and bumped his head
mama called the doctor and the doctor said
“no more monkeys jumping on the bed”

two little monkeys jumping on the bed
one fell off and bumped his head
mama called the doctor and the doctor said
“no more monkeys jumping on the bed”

one little monkey jumping on the bed
he fell off and bumped his head
