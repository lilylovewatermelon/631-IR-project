look
selfawareness
prides a coat and yes i like to wear it
buttoned up dont like to let no air in
with a pair of gloves that i hope doesnt perish
i discovered though when i get holes in them and i let joy in im in higher spirits
my mistakes are like a screamin parrot
just repeatin lyrics i can barely bear it when im lost
road is narrow im lookin down it like a guns barrel
arent we all searchin for the serum
that could help us breathe and leave our state of peril
all of us have made defensive scarecrows
that we scatter round our fields and treat like heroes
when they scare away the things that we should cherish
cause were too embarrassed to admit the fear is that were lost
yeah but what does it matter
i get so combative inside of mes a personal canvas
the paint can be splattered get messy when i start to get rattled
the heart of a savage im quiet when i lurk in the shadows
but somethin dont add up i dont wanna be overdramatic
but look at the data its obvious that humans are fragile
we tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
we need someone thatll be honest when we fly off the handle
i admit i throw a fit when i begin to unravel
keep my wits been off the grid but now im back in the saddle
my intent is not to rent i like to own what i value
i could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
i like to row against the current thats the way that i travel
opposite of what the grain does got the brain of a rebel
take initiative im diligent on every level
i never could settle i like to keep my foot on the pedal yeah
id love to pack arenas and all
but what i really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
and put the reins on em show em im the one thats the boss
and pull em back when they get out of hand im breakin they jaws
im takin the flaws that told me i could never evolve
then pull a bane on em ask em oh you think youre in charge
you oughta know better aint no way around it im flawed
the traits that i want they say i cant afford what it cost

but i manifested this
failings how you grow and learn your lessons kids
take the worst and try to make the best of it
cause when you fail just know that its a test and if
you can learn to pick yourself back up again
and train your brain to not be such a pessimist
its okay to make mistakes just dont forget that
theres a high road but i skip the exit when im lost lost

chorus nf
yeah
when im lost
when im lost lost
when im lost
when im lost lost

verse 2 hopsin
wow these burdens are heavy
and im hopin it dont bury me
i used to be joyful and skip so merrily
but now im too cautious and tip toe carefully
my mind left and its nowhere to be found
am i a big ol parody
cause its no fair to me
and now im at the point where im spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
look im tryna wash away my sins
i got a group of loved ones that aint my friends
and if i ever take an l then they might grin
and they all wanna see me stay in the cage im in
so when it come to anybody theres no trust for no one
man so what my whole plans to go nuts
my shoulders ready for more shrugs im gon judge
anybody tryna enter my circle with no love hol up
my sanitys gone id rather be torn
from this planet they planted me on yes thats a reward
im actually bored with having a sore heart
its torn apart from a family that i dont have anymore man hol up
i was livin so oblivious
with millions it really was a pity huh a pity huh
its kinda funny what a penny does
mixed in with a mini buzz i feel stuck
lifes got me by the neck with a blade against it what
guess i was runnin late for the train and missed it what
the only thing i feel is pain and vengeance what
so ima act out like a ragin misfit what
and every verse i lay gon stay sadistic yeah
you wanna hate me good great terrific good
youll never see the day where my angers dismissed
you better go and change your wish list cause i
prechorus hopsin nf  both
yeah manifested this
do not treat me like some adolescent kid
i am prayin to the lord with the book of james
hopin he gon add my testament
this dark cloud thats my residence
demons knockin i dont have to let em in
i done made mistakes day to day
you probably cant relate
i just aint the same when im lost lost

chorus nf
