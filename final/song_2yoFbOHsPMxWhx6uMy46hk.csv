you were wrong

verse 1
you always took from me you always lied to me
while i tried to fake a smile
is this only way that you know how to play
watch me prove you wrong

youre always telling me to bite my tongue

just take it back take it back i was blind
woah you were wrong you blamed me
just take it back take it back i was blind
you were wrong

verse 2
you always took away never giving anything
