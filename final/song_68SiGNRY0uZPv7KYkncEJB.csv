every days harder been trying to change
but lately i really been feeling the urge
dealing with demons been hearing em speaking
and popping this shit just to deal with the nerves
and i dont know who i am anymore
feel like the past is knocking at my door
bound by these chains my old habits wont let go of me
im somewhere between the man i was and who i wanna be
struggle with recovery tryna find inner peace
tryna find a way to quit my need to feed the inner beast
and my backs against the wall
and i could lose it all
theres a freedom thats involved
every time i fall

chorus jelly roll
hopeless
why do i always feel so hopeless
i say i love it but its really cause i need it
this addiction i keep feeding
i cant have this feeling
i know ima need a freedom
but im hopeless
why do i always feel so hopeless
i fucking hate it but i feel like i cant beat it
i could fly away this evening
but i dont wanna overdose
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 still matthews
now its four in the mornin and im up here feeling lonely
inside this fucking head of mine and you dont even know me
im over you but i aint over you
wake me up ive been dreaming
in and out of love im leaning
feeling like a fucking pea praying
a relapse just might heal me
im overdue being over you
how could you love me how can you hate me
how come i dont give a fuck
 is in me
and i got one hell of a buzz
high as a fuck light that all up
substance are fighting in us
put it on you put it on me
im all in calling your bluff

chorus jelly roll
hopeless
why do i always feel so hopeless
i say i love it but its really cause i need it
this addiction i keep feeding
i cant have this feeling
i know ima need a freedom
but im hopeless
why do i always feel so hopeless
i fucking hate it but i feel like i cant beat it
i could fly away this evening
but i dont wanna overdoseembed"
