chest to chest chest to chest
nose to nose nose to nose
palm to palm
we were always just that close just that close
wrist to wrist wrist to wrist
toe to toe toe to toe
lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

prechorus
so how come when i reach out my finger
it feels like more than distance between us

chorus
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king

verse 2
eye to eye eye to eye
cheek to cheek cheek to cheek
side by side
you were sleeping next to me oh next to me
arm in arm
dusk to dawn
with the curtains drawn
and a little last night on these sheets

so how come when i reach out my fingers
it seems like more than distance between us

chorus
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king

bridge
just when i felt like giving up on us
you turned around and gave me one last touch
that made everything feel better
and even then my eyes got wetter
so confused wanna ask you if you love me
but i dont wanna seem so weak
maybe ive been california dreaming
hey hey hey hey

chorus
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king
guitar solo
my california king

chorus
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
