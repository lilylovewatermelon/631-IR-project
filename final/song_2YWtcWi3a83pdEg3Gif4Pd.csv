i think he knows
his footprints on the sidewalk
lead to where i cant stop
go there every night
i think he knows
his hands around a cold glass
make me wanna know that
body like its mine

i am an architect im drawing up the plans

skipping down 16th avenue

i want you bless my soul
and i aint gotta tell him i think he knows
