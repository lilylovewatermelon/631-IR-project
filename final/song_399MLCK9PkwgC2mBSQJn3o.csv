i love the night i love the mystery
i love to gaze into infinity
little lights that lead as far as i can see
i love the way they seem to wink at me
i love to think about a possibility
of a world where you care for me

chorus
i love the stars
jadore les etoiles
i love to make believe the universe is ours
i love the stars
jadore les etoiles
well i believe that somewhere out there
you and i make love together
on and on and on
i love the stars

verse 2
i love the way they shine i love the fantasy
i love to stare into eternity
let my mind become a wave upon the sea
and then i race across the galaxy
far away beyond reality
to a world where you care for me

the sun and the moon and the stars will align
