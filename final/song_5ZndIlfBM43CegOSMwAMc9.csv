youre in control pressing pause on my heartbeat
someone stole all the air so i cant speak now
i know the chase is on
i feel as though my time has come
how many times do i fly through your head space
now its speeding away from the safe place

prechorus jay
yeah your skin
the touch the kiss
the rush too much
and here it comes

chorus all
when your lips touch mine
its the kiss of life
i know i know that its a little bit frightening
we might as well be playing with lightning
we touch like like its our first time
i know that its a little bit frightening
we might as well be playing with lightning now

verse 2 siva  nathan
just you and me and the coats in the back room
learning things they dont teach in the classroom
now youre here
i feel the fear
but everything is oh so clear
ive been addicted to you
since the first hit
out of control like a surge of electric

yeah your skin
the touch the kiss
the rush too much
and here it comes

chorus all
when your lips touch mine
its the kiss of life
i know i know that its a little bit frightening
we might as well be playing with lightning
we touch like like its our first time
i know that its a little bit frightening
we might as well be playing with lightning now

bridge all
your skin the touch
the kiss too much
your skin the touch
the kiss the rush
your skin the touch
the kiss too much
the rush the rush
the rush the rush

chorus all
when your lips touch mine
its the kiss of life
i know i know that its a little bit frightening
we might as well be playing with lightning
we touch like like its our first time
i know that its a little bit frightening
