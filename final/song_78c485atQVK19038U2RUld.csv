loving him is like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all

chorus
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark gray all alone woah
forgetting him was like tryin to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red red red
red red
but loving him was red red red
red red

verse 2
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

chorus
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark gray all alone woah
forgetting him was like tryin to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red red red
oh red red red
burning red red red
red red
