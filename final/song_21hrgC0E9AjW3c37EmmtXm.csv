if you go theyll say youre following
if you dont then youre too good for them
if you smile you must be ignorant
if you dont whats your problem
if youre down so ungrateful
and if youre happy why so selfish
and you cant win no
you cant win no

underdressed under your skin oh
a walking disaster
every time you try to fly you end up falling out of line oh
you cant you cant win no

verse 2
if youre thin poor little walking disease
if youre not theyre all screaming obese
if youre straight why arent you married yet
if youre gay why arent you wavin a flag
if its wrong youre nailing it
if its right you always miss
you cant win no
you cant win no
