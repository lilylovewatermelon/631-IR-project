i miss you i miss you

verse 1 mark hoppus
hello there
the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim
of darkness in the valley
we can live like jack and sally if we want
where you can always find me
and well have halloween on christmas
and in the night well wish this never ends
well wish this never ends

interlude mark hoppus
i miss you i miss you
i miss you i miss you

verse 2 tom delonge
where are you and im so sorry
i cannot sleep i cannot dream tonight
i need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as i stare i counted
the webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight
