verse 1
with your loving there aint nothing that i cant adore
the way im running with you honey
means we can break every law
i find it funny that youre the only one i never looked for
there is something in your loving that tears down my walls

prechorus
i wasnt ready then im ready now
im heading straight for you
you will only be eternally
the one that i belong to

chorus
the sweetest devotion
hit me like an explosion
all of my life ive been frozen
the sweetest devotion i know

verse 2
ill forever be whatever you want me to be
ill go under and all over for your clarity
when you wonder if im gonna lose my way home
just remember that come whatever ill be yours all along

in every face that ive ever known
and there is something bout the way you love me
that finally feels like home

youre the right kind of madness
youre my hope youre my despair
youre my scope of everything everywhere
