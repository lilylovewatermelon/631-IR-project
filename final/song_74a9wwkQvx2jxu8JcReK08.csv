i pick things up i am a collector
and things well things they tend to accumulate
i have this net it drags behind me
it picks up feelings for me to feed upon
there are times plenty of times i wish i could let it go
but they start to breathe and they start to grow inside me
there are times plenty of times i wish i could let it go
but they start to make me think things i dont wanna know

chorus
im tryin to fit it all inside
im tryin to open my mouth wide
im tryin not to choke and swallow it all swallow it all
swallow it all swallow it all

verse 2
i am the plague i am the swarm
all your hurt sticks on me and i keep it warm
they will make me stay they wont let me leave
there are so goddamn many of them it gets hard to breathe

chorus
im tryin to fit it all inside
im tryin to open my mouth wide
im tryin not to choke inside
i am a good boy and i will swallow it all swallow it all
swallow it all swallow it all
