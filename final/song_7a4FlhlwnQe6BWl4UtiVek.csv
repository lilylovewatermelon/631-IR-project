after all the time
after you
had you seen me with someone new
hanging so high for your return
but the stillness is a burn
had i seen it in your eyes
thered have been no try after try
your leaving had no goodbye
had i just seen one in your eyes

chorus
i cant give it up
to someone elses touch
because i care too much
i cant give it up
to someone elses touch
because i care too much
care too much
care too much

verse 2
could you tell
i was left lost and lonely
could you tell
things aint worked out my way
wish the best for you
wish the best for me
wished for infinity
if that aint me
then give it up
i cant give it up
give it up
i cant give it up

because i care too much
i cant give it up
to someone elses touch
because i care too much
care too much
care too much

chorus 2
give it up
i cant give it up
give it up
i cant give it up
give it up
i cant give it up
