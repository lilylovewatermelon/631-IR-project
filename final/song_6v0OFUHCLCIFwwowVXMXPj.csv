i hope you show up in that black dress
you know that one you never keep on too long
i hope youre with me ’til my last breath
like a record to the needle when they playing this song
youre the only one that could ever play me like i play this guitar
baby i aint dead yet so go and and smash the pedal in this getaway car
let’s take it too far too far
too far mhh

verse jelly roll
raised on the west coast but shes loving my country grammar
this that true romance its like clarence and alabama
tarantino love stories so dark and so beautiful
to ever find a love like this is so unusual
i know that youre feeling my vibe
hop in this truck and lets ride
dont give a fuck i feel the rush
lets roll one up and get high
city to city baby we gon keep those tides turning
look in your eyes mama and i can see that fire burning

chorus ryan nelson
i hope you show up in that black dress
you know that one you never keep on too long
i hope you’re with me ’til my last breath
like a record to the needle when they playing this song
youre the only one that could ever play me like i play this guitar
baby i ain’t dead yet so go and and smash the pedal in this getaway car
lets take it too far too far
too far mhhsee jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeembed"
