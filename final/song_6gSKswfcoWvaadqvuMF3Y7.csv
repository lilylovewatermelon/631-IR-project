i am a man man man man up up in the air
and i run around round round round this town town
and act like i dont care
so when you see me flying by the planets moon
you dont need to explain if everythings changed
just know im just like you

so i pull the switch the switch the switch inside my head
and i see black black green and brown
brown brown brown and blue yellow violets red
and suddenly a light appears inside my brain
and i think of my ways i think of my days
and know that i have changed
