enjoy yourself  every day above ground is a good day  anonymous miami 1981

1 a prologue
crawls up the screen  with narrator

narrator
in may 1980 fidel castro  in an effort to normalize relations with the carter administration  opened the harbor at mariel cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the united states within seventytwo hours 3000 us boats were headed for cuba in the next few weeks it became evident that castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population by the time the port was closed 125000 marielitos had landed in florida an estimated 25000 had criminal records this is the story of that minority  those they call los bandidos

the prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we

cut to

opening montage  documentary footage

from the harbor in mariel cuba vessels of every nature
waving masses demonstrations

3 the crossing
sun and storm

4 the landing  key west
the flag of the united states choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the keys emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft an america the beautifultype immigration theme surging over this
5 the processing
long lines immigration and nationalization officials customs public health fbi church and relief organizations
babies bawling arguments over paperwork refugees being
interviewed by tv news people crying people eating
families huddled on floors chaos
the music theme continuing in stately calm as we

then we move to the eyes pure in their fury finally we
encompass the face  the face of a man about to explode 
muscle tissue brain  a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment inflict or receive either one
he is clothed in rags crossed with holes his shoes broken
cardboard his hair unkempt his complexion sallow from
prison

handling tony stares at it his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place a brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in tony

expression alters to uncertainty

voice

tony changes his mind hangs up pause the faces of those
in line peer in the next party raps on the door but tony
ignores it slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants then at his own pace exits the phone booth

somebody in another phone booth and goes over

the phone then hangs up a desolate look on his face a
worn phone book in his hand

tony

36 int toads motel room  day
theres suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside then
commotion

angel
tony

tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek like a bird

lizard
slang spanish
dont get up now shithead

shes standing there with a 32 pointed steady at him the eyes like angry steel theres no mistaking her ability to shoot

the toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back approaches tony angel is shoved into the room followed by two more
columbians the kids

they slam the door both carrying uzis with silencers neither of them higher than fivefour or older than twenty with their straight black indian hair cut across their blank eyes they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing muttering with the lizard in fast columbese slang

as toad strips the handgun from tony

tony
frog face you just fucked up you steal from me youre dead

toad shrugs he couldnt care less

toad
yeah okay you gonna give me the cash or am i gonna kill your brother first fore i kill you

tony
why dont you try sticking your head up your ass see if it fits

toad completing the body search rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of tonys back as he mutters something
in hard columbian slang to the two kids who shove angel
into the bathroom producing strands of thick rope
even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed toad begins
assembling it as lizard still covering tony with her gun completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set the news ironically not in miami is about a drugrelated triplehomicide

shoots a surprised lizard as she raises her pistol she crashes backwards into the room wounded everything happens very fast now

tony not tied up yet spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face sending him reeling across the bathroom

the toad chainsaw in hand slashes at manny

manny fires a burst into him and the toad crashes backwards

the lizard wounded on her knees is firing her 32 at
him in the background the window simultaneously blows out as chichi appears firing a burst with his ingram

in sharp foreground the lizard crumples forward on her knees foaming blood

tony with the tape still stuck across his mouth smashes kid two pinned against the bloodstained sink with the stock of his own ingram

in the midst of this the toad jumps up wounded but with strength he tears out the motel room door hysterical gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action

chichi climbing through the window fires at him

meanwhile kid two with a rattlesnake life in him produces
a knife out of nowhere just missing tonys gut by a halfsecond as tony dances back getting a grip on the machine pistol

he blows kid two away pointblank putting another ten craters in the mirror of the nowwrecked motel room

cochabamba boliva
alejandro sosa is a playboy about sixfoottwo black wavy
hair athletic body and a copacabana tan the clothes a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from calvin klein

on his wrist is a flashy gold id bracelet with alex written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe 30000 his eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money

accompanying him everywhere is the shadow a thin intense
venomouslooking hispanic man in his thirties he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face he is always in
proximity to his jefe usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing sosa  in a sort of garotte
position his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him he is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes particularly coming to affect omar
who is insecure to begin with

sosa is showing tony and omar through his coke processing
lab past four coalfired stoves each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries the chemists and indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey as he passes as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard

sosa
so this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year problem is i have no steady
market some months i cant get rid of fifty keys other months i have to do 2 to 300 keys its crazy hunh nobody can run a business that way 

omar
i know what you mean mr sosa we got the same problems up in miami the demand varies for us too month to month

sosa looks at him like thats obvious and moves on in his
skinny suit with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers omars not quite in his league with sosa

tony awed by the scope of it all follows along stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke
the shadow stops eyeballs him

tony eyeballs him back playing a game with him then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose
pause his expression says i like it he moves on
the shadow moves with him

sosa
meanwhile
basically what im looking for is somebody to share the risks with me somebody in the states who might guarantee me something like  say 150 kilos a month

omar
thats a big commitment mr sosa its too bad franks not here something like that you should talk to him

sosa
yes it wouldve been nice if he could have come

tony
cutting in
and hed like meeting you too mr sosa but with his trial coming up yknow its not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now yunderstand

sosa
taking the measure of tony sarcastic
so he sent you

tony
yeah something like that you sure got good stuff in there mr sosa  class a shit

looking over the laboratory like it was his
omar glances at him annoyed

sosa
well talk at my house shall we go

to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the spanish classical period and ornate candelabra
at the table are sosa omar tony the shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side watching omar and tony tony is impressed looking at the plates the glasses the silverware uncomfortable trying to fit in
he eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro constantly hanging dishes confusing tony adlib during scene

sosa
to omar
say lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year and he picks it up down here i could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo you cannot do better than that

omar
well we do that we gotta take the
risk of moving it also wed be cutting out the columbians you
know what that means

tony
that means we gotta go to war with
em
looks over at him not quite knowing yet what to make
sosa
of this guy
sosa
when we cut out the colombians we take risks  on both sides

tony
split the risk guarantee your delivery as far as panama

sosa
panama risky it costs me more there id sell maybe 135 a key

tony
135 what are you nuts we still gotta take the shit to florida you
know what thats like these days
they got the navy all over the fuckin place they got frogmen they got ec2s with satellite tracking shit in em they got fuckin bell 209 assault choppers up the ass were losing one out of every nine loads its no duckwalk for us anymore yknow forget it

omar is looking at him ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power  whereas sosa chuckles amused by his brashness starting to be intrigued by this animal

sosa
what do you suggest is a fair
excuse me

interrupted sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door apparently with a message sosa waves
him in

the black aide  the skull  is a slim tall imposing man
with academic hornrimmed glasses and closecropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull he combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual as he approaches he glances down the table his eyes falling briefly on omar who doesnt connect the skull falters  just for a moment  then continues towards sosa with the same stony loyal expression

sosa lends his ear and the skull whispers his information
a beat
he whispers a second thought sosa reacts minimally
then he nods dismissing the skull who heads out the room
sosa glances at his gold rolex

omar
meanwhile in a whisper to tony
shaddup willya montana im doing the talking here

tony shrugs

sosa
where were we

tony
panama youre looking for a partner right

omar shoots a poisonous glance at tony

sosa
something like that
chuckles

omar
look mr sosa were getting ahead of ourselves here im down on franks authority to buy 200 keys thats it thats my limit i got no right to negotiate for frank lopez on anything larger than that so why dont we

tony
hey omar why dont you let the man finish hunh let him propose his proposition

omar
hey montana you got no authority here okay i started you in this business all right so shut the fuck up

tony
shrugs
frankll love it dont worry about it

omar
thats up to frank  not you

he looks embarrassed at sosa who has been watching sensing
 also an advantage in the split

omar
im sorry about this mr sosa

sosa
its all right maybe your partners right maybe you should talk to
frank

omar
a beat
okay i dont think this is something i want to do on an overseas phone but i can go back to miami and talk to frank personally

sosa
without hesitation

omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan

omar
yeah i guess so

tony

sosa
glancing at tony to omar
leave your friend here while youre gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business

omar

the chopper lifts off the lawn the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa

sosa walks tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits

tony

sosa

tony
cause the islands in the caribbean the governments in russia the armys in angola and the people live in miami

gabriella

she withdraws tony watches her go

tony

sosa pleased reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table looks up through them at the helicopter rising off the lawn

sosa
focusing the binoculars

the same way about the rest of your organization

tony glances up at the chopper the servant pouring coffee for him

tony

tony puzzled glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate

sosa passes him the binoculars

sosa
this garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch
from several years ago in new york he was an informer for the police

tony astonished looks up

96 through the binoculars  omar 96
terrified being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the shadow and the skull his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck he is struggling backwards in vain

sosa
he put vito duval and the ramos brothers  nello and gino  away for life my associate used to work up there

through the binoculars  they throw omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut snapping his neck he hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight
a silence

shaken lowers the binoculars
sosa watches him closely for his reaction
tony looks back at him contemplative
sosa goes over pours himself some coffee

113 int babylon club  later that night 113
the owner appears at the mike the music drifting to sinatras strangers in the night

owner
all right you coneheads another exciting evening at the babylon hunh
now i want you to check out this next hombre i found him stoned in the jungle and theres nothing youll ever see like him i present with great pride from caracas venezuela  octavia 

lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the sinatra song as
sadeyed octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot
light drawing immediate laughter

he is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck
with a red bulb for a nose he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song once the mood of laughter has been established the music suddenly shifts upbeat to saturday night fever and the clown like a butterfly from a worm starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy

tony watches sitting alone distracted by the clown
more laughter more clothes coming off building a tempo
when the head mask comes off we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience

tony is hooked by the image looks on
the clown is down to his leotards thin as a stick and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him
bouncing around like yoyos everybody is laughing everybody is merry

except tony and the clown weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close a haunting figure of mockery

tony absorbed by his thoughts is lucky this time his
antennae warn him out of the side of his eye he sees

the two hitters moving on him
he sprawls machine gun fire rips through the upholstery
smashing the mirrors
screams crowd diving for cover

tony hit in the shoulder rolls gets his beretta out of
his ankle firing
hits one of the gunmen in the chest the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings

tony moving under the tables towards the door firing
the second hitter is pinned firing back breaking more
mirrors and more screaming

tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door his clothes ripped with blood and glass

the clown octavia lies dead on the silent dance floor

cut to
114 ext the babylon club  night 114
tony runs out crouched to his red jaguar

exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot he runs out of ammunition
he jumps into the jaguar his windows being blown out

the second hitter wounded running out of the club towards him
the third hitter advancing carhops scattering

tony reaching under his seat gets a hold of his own ingram machine pistol cocks it and lays down a field of fire

carhops scattering the hitters seeking cover
hitter two already wounded is hit again his head exploding like squashed watermelon

tony now pops a button bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows
he guns the jaguar out into the lot bullets careening off
the armor plating whining against the shutters

tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse in an instant his warmobile in reverse accelerates climbing to top speed
as hitter three realizes its too late tries to get out of
there but is overtaken and crushed by the car

news anchorman
the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated 100 billion a year business it seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way prohibition was solved
not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them these voices say that will drive out the organized crime element
pause for effect

rings on his fingers and sharp porky eyes

the other guy  luis  a dark cuban is long lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes he drinks
coffee smiles a lot and bullshits  two sordid guys who
look the part

its a tedious process counting a million five in twenties it takes fourfive hours and throughout the desultory dialogue tony absorbed by the money and nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts
at all times all four men thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored they drink a lot of coffee

a phil donahuetype setting a segment now in progress
with the donahuetype interviewing dr orlando gutierrez
gutierrez is a young charismatic man very well dressed and
polished in a south american manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion

gutierrez
more than 10000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial in the past two years another 6000 have simply disappeared and your government  what does it do it
sells my government tanks planes guns but not a word  nota whisper about human rights

interviewer
ive heard whispers doctor gutierrez about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in bolivia

gutierrez
the irony of course is that this money  which is in the billions
jim   is coming from your country you are the major purchaser of our national product  which of course is cocaine

interviewer
so what youre saying doctor gutierrez is the united states government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those streets with cocaine thats a bit like robbing peter to pay paul isnt it

gutierrez
laughs
let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy jim my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man 

gutierrez holds up a photograph  insert the face on the tv
screen dour ruthless

gutierrez
   here he is the charming face belongs to general cucombre the defense minister of my country two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa onlake lucerne in switzerland

this is alejandro sosa interesting character a wealthy landowner educated in england good family the business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the andes not your ordinary drug dealer

interviewer
what are you suggesting we do about this doctor

gutierrez
passionate
the united states government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country that is what your country has to do you have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights

171 tony 171
staring intently at him reluctantly impressed

gutierrez
you americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights you have no

they trundle her up the stairs tony turns and walks away

224 int tonys office  night 224
tony slumps on his couch a haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a christmas card
oblivious to the dust he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table

ernie and chichi come in

chichi
we got some pills into her shes cooling down

tony pays no attention ernie and chichi noticing the pile of coke
flashing his silver tooter tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table

ernie a little scared of him now turns away chichi follows

tony starts on another trek along the coffee table

cut to
225 ext tonys mansion grounds  later that night 225
the bengal tiger paces his spot restless
a monsoonlike wind blows through the trees on the estate
the monkeys listen quietly
the flamingoes flutter
   then theres a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony  a billy joel song something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go

   and we see tony in long shot throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony overlooking his estate
   on a closer angle we track him to the edge of the
balustrade hes done so much coke now hes practically
catatonic staggering and muttering to himself

tony
insensate
   jesus fuckin christ whatsa matter with me get a hold of yself now these cocksuckers gonna run over you let em try i bury the cocksuckers

his point of view  panning his estate the dark emptiness echoes back at him the wind rustling the treetops
tony shaking his head at himself he starts to cry

tony
ooooh fuck manny how the fuck did i do that how the fuck oh manny manny you were there for me you were the one manny you understood always understood
well what the hell happened hunh
what the hell happened to us

in far background now behind tony on the video monitors in his office we see

the main gate and guard shack  a marielito crosses into view checks the gate turns suddenly two figures spring
out at him one of them garrotting the marielito he struggles

another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack they knife the other marielito

a third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate

on the balcony tony is oblivious to it all spent almost
incoherent

tony
i said to you manny i said i never go crazy and you said i would
you sonofabitch and you was right those were the good days hunh we was crazy back in those days wed do anything you and me we was on the way up nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh  the fucking best

as tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade a shadow starts climbing up as

tony
we still are manny we still are see im gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there im gonna run the market im gonna be king cocaine you hear me you buy you buy from me  tony montana covers of all the magazines fan mail television stars movie stars shooting stars  hes a star


226 int tonys mansion  office 226
as he crosses into his office the camera moves to reveal gina standing there halfdressed in the doorway her eyes blazing with hatred
tony sees her
she steps forward offering her body almost naked to her
brother

gina
is this what you want tony

tony shocked

gina
you cant stand another man touching me so you want me tony is that it well here i am

she fires the baretta we now see in her hand

the bullet grazes tony in the leg snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk she fires again again

gina
im all yours tony im all yours now

bullets ripping into the desk she advances offering her sex methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals

gina
come and get me tony before its too late

he spins across the run away from the desk trying to put
distance between them she sees him scurrying turns an
expression like a demented angel

gina
come on tony fuck me fuck me fuck me

advancing on him firing the furniture tearing up the chair
spilling television sets and computer toys shattering tony
squirming away hit again in the thigh shocked scrambling
over to the terrace windows her next shot shatters the window and as tony ducks again to the side we see outside onto the terrace behind him

a young columbian punk no more than twenty  one of the
hitters  is crouched there reacting to the broken window
he doesnt hesitate turning his machine gun on gina

gina is torn to pieces by the firepower  blown across the
room spine severed and dead before she hits the floor

tony sees it yells something in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside
the punk is taken by surprise not having seen tony and tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade

the punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony
tony from above grabs up the punks machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below

ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool spots tony yells up 

ernie
get outta here
tony theyre everywhere

ernie suddenly wheels hit in the face by a burst of silencer bullets

we catch a brief glimpse of sosas black aide the skull
moving quickly along the wall of the house  directly
underneath the balcony on which tony stands

tony tossing the empty machine gun aside wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns crosses to gina corpse
it takes him by surprise he comes to a dead stop kneels looking questioningly in her face

tony
gently
hey gina come on you still angry at me i didnt mean to kill manny i was i was

running his hands along her face trying to rouse her gently lifting her eyelids bloods running out of her mouth in rivers

tony tx
come on gina get off the floor
youre all dirty now you need a bath
mamis gonna be angry baby
 ooh is she gonna be mad at me
come on open your eyes my baby
open your eyes give me a smile

theres been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office tony finally hears it looks up then over at the monitors
one of them reveals chichi standing there outside the door
pounding it

chichi
boss  hey boss open up

on the monitor we see chichi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer return fire decimates him a grenade
goes off blows him up against the door

tony
cheeee

he now seems to come out of his catatonia runs to his
sideboard hauls out a rocket shoulderfired rocket launcher and straps an uzi across his shoulder he looks up at the monitor

on the monitors the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs
three of them are already huddled outside the door around
the corpse of chichi motioning toeach other laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out

tony loading his rocket intends to beat them to the punch
talking to himself

tony
so you wanna play hunh say hello to my little friend here

karroooomph
the rocket tears down the door and blows the columbian punks off the landing into the foyer
it sounds like armageddon one of the hitters screaming smoke billowing wildly

tony at the height of his mad glory steps out at the apex
of the stairs firing his machine gun and yelling

tony
whores cowards you think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh

another hitter tumbles down the righthand stair

tony
who you think i am i kill all you fuckin assholes i take you all to fuckin hell

another hitter drops screaming off the stairs into the pool below
a grenade goes off tony is hit again but keeps on firing
away laughing like a madman

tony
you need an army you hear an army to kill me

behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind whipping around the office in auras of white it is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the skull moving from the terrace towards tonys back with a sawedoff shotgun

tony
ha ha ha ha ha you whores you scum i piss in your faces ha ha ha ha ha

the skull now inches from tonys back pulls the trigger and blows tonys spine out his belly

tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below

he floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters

as the titles begin their crawl up the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety

the camera moving off tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters it says
the world is yours
and so for the brief moment it was

our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool
panning past the dream villa past the shambles and the
wealth past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word chivato in blood on the outside walls
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down coconut
grove  to the miami skyline across biscayne bay

the endembed"
