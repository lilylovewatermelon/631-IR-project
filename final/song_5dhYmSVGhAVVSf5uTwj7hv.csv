verse 1 absoul  mac miller
in my lifetime my whole mo was to get this money
sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor soul
long story short thats one of my longterm goals
my anatomy is platinum gold is old
lettin my hair swang like pootie tang uh
i done seen some spooky things through these gucci shades
acute to cute bitches niggas with drums
niggas with bands like the martin luther king parade i have a dream
but cant we all just get along that one day
like martin lawrence would say and get along with our day
she say soulo you so crazy and deranged i say i know

verse 2 mac miller
in this lifetime be the time of your life
its been a while but itll come back to you just like ridin a bike alright alright
and as a child i was curious my mind was the dirtiest uhhuh
curse words was probably my first words affirmative god damn
my home run derby shit derby shit was makin profit out the park
even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
i had to fight for mine tyson in his prime used to idolize
had to right my wrongs the days short the nights is long
im makin corpses when its on and eatin swordfish
from gigantic portions lord is important but i am stronger
im a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
walk on water wont be long til im flyin thats my departure jesus
im a goner
shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer ah yeah
better find that thing you die for ah yeah
i dont know what i get so high for ah yeah
im a problem and as hard as i try no hidin from karma
youd be traumatized seein what came across these eyes
there was a time
