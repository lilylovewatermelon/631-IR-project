i dont know how i should say it
in my mind its every word that they dont wanna hear
i dont know how they might take it
maybe you can take the pressure and make it disappear
throw out the inhibition
you make me feel a feeling that ive never felt before
i dont know if theyre gonna like it
but that only makes me want it more

prechorus
cause im nobodys but yours

chorus
if its me and if its you
and if our love is wrong
then i dont ever wanna be right
i dont ever wanna be right
if its real and if its true
and if our love is wrong
then i dont ever wanna be right
i dont ever wanna be right

postchorus
oh yeah oh
i just want you to be mine
see calum scott liveget tickets as low as 62you might also likeverse 2
why would i need their permission
skin and bones im only human
its in my dna
suffocating just to fit in
why do i care what people say

prechorus
cause im nobodys but yours

chorus
if its me and if its you
and if our love is wrong
then i dont ever wanna be right
i dont ever wanna be right
if its real and if its true
and if our love is wrong
then i dont ever wanna be right
i dont ever wanna be right

postchorus
oh yeah oh
i just want you to be mine
