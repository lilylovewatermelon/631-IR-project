hey hey
she had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
you grow up quick when you grow up poor
its the only way to la that she knows
the hollywood pose teeth tits and toes
it didnt take her long to leave the boulevard
so many five star friends with black credit cards
shed try anything once
cause anything goes
it never comes easy when youre digging for gold

chorus
hey hey
well she aint no cinderella
when shes getting undressed
cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
far too pretty to be giving it cheap
thats why shes making six figures working three days a week
yeah shed even break a promise in the promiseland
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands
shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands

verse 2
hey hey
i doubt shed even let the devil buy her little black book
city hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
every alist player is her favorite friend
since they all taste the same in the back of the benz
a congressman would call her every once in a while
got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
shed done everyone once and everyone knows
you gotta get a little dirty when youre digging for gold
hey hey

well she aint no cinderella
when shes getting undressed
cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
far too pretty to be giving it cheap
thats why shes making six figures working three days a week
yeah shed even break a promise in the promiseland
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands
shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands

bridge
well someone spilled the beans and now her names in the press
tough to keep it all a secret when youre one of the best
the judge is going easy cause he paid for her chest
yeah he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west

chorus
far too pretty to be giving it cheap
thats why shes making six figures working three days a week
yeah shed even break a promise in the promiseland
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands
shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands
shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
she didnt make it this far by just shaking hands2embed"
