without a sound i took her down
and dressed in red and blue i squeezed
imaginary wedding gown
that you cant wear in front of me

chorus
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
lets say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow well do it again

postchorus
tomorrow well do it again

verse 2
i dragged her down i put her out
and back there i left her where no one could see
and lifeless cold into this well
i stared as this moment was held for me

chorus
a kiss goodbye your twisted shell
as rice grains and roses fall at your feet
lets say goodbye the hundredth time
and then tomorrow well do it again

i never thought itd be this way
just me and you were here alone
and if you say all im asking for is
a thousand bodies piled up
i never thought would be enough
to show you just what ive been thinking

and ill keep on making more
just to prove that i adore every inch of sanity
all im asking for is all im asking for is
come on

bridge
these hands stained red
from the times that ive killed you and then
we can wash down this engagement ring
with poison and kerosene
well laugh as we die
and well celebrate the end of things
with cheap champagne

outro
without without a sound
without without a sound and i wish you away
without a sound and i wish you away
without a sound without a sound and i wish you away
without a sound without a sound and i wish you away
without a sound without a sound and i wish you away25embed"
