cause she say wayne wayne
so she got me all impatient
cry me a river i can hear my conscious
while i say aloud

boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
but yourself
youre like a hot revolver hot revolver
but you aint killin no one but yourself
and so shes gone to party town on her own
and you go by yourself so all alone
i told her i can be with her
but i cant be with her
as much as she like me to
she like me too much thats the problem
oh my god then shorty be wildin
and when i say i got to leave
you wouldnt believe all of the things
that shell do and all of the things
that shell say to make me stay
and i be like daaaaaammmmnnnnnn

i been that boy for forever
ill be back someday
but she wanna go with me to outer space
so we made love in the milky way and then i send her on her way
boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
but yourself
your like a hot revolver
but you aint killin no one
but yourself
and so shes gone to party town
on her own
and you go by yourself
so all alone3embed"
