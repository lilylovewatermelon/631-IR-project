my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day deep into the sea
but takes a little piece of me a little piece of me

verse 1
oh its so beautiful out and i cant see why were not allowed to be
up in the sky with the birds counting the flowers
oh my powers have failed me again when i cant see beginning to end
and i try to test it again through the hours
i get so stuck on leaving but i guess i think ill stay
ill be hanging around here anyway
i get so stuck on leaving hell i think ill go
cause they dont want me around here no no

chorus
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
my love grows deeper every day deep into the sea
but takes a little piece of me a little piece of me

verse 2
oh why cant i be green as the grass beneath my feet
as fresh as the dew hits the ground in the morning
and not yellow like bumble bees please take me off my knees
cause i dont wanna be red forever
