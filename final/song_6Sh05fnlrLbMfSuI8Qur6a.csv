if you want to live let live
if you want to go let go
im not afraid to dream to sleep sleep forever

verse
i dont need to touch the sky
i just want to feel that high
and you refuse to lift me

prechorus
guess it wasnt real after all
guess it wasnt real all along

chorus
if i fall
and all is lost
its where i belong

refrain
if you want to live let live
if you want to go let go
im never gonna be your sweet sweet surrender

prechorus
guess it wasnt real after all
guess it wasnt real all along

and all is lost
no light to lead the way
