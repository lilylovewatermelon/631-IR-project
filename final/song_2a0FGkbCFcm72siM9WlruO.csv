i play doctor for five minutes flat
before i cut my heart open and let the air out
three bugs a pound of dust
some wind spilled before me
in the strangest manner that had
broke away my tear spout

verse 1
as i lie there with my tongue spread wide open
a black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
as i injected the candied heart that i selected
she said dont hesitate just do what you have to do to me

verse 2
its hard to stay between the lines of skin
just cause i have nerves dont mean that i can feel
i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red cause i cant feel
its hard to stay between the lines of skin
just cause i have nerves dont mean that i can feel
i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red cause i cant feel

biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time its time
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time its time
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time its time
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time until the time is right
biding my time its time
biding biding biding biding

someone in behind me
someone inside me
everyone against me
everyone beside me
clawing away the pieces
scratching away the abscess
one more two more
everyone once more
one more two more
everyone once more
inside the places that i hide from you
i want to see you splayed before me
you are the only one
that i would rather see before me
you want it you need it
you want it you need it
you want it you need it
you want it you need it
dont lie i die you lie i lie oh why
i dont want you to pay anyone when i die
i wanna die id rather die i wanna die
you purge you burn you purge
i dont need you anymore i dont need you
