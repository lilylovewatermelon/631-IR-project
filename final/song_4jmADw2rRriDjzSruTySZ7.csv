my eyes have once again been proven wrong
your clouds your blanket and my pity song
hovering on your front lawn
carry on until its gone

chorus
what can i do
the river is overrun
were swimming in a flood you know
i thought i felt your touch
but the water is rising up

verse 2
then i lie naked in a rampage
in the flesh face to face with the onset
i forget everything thats ever made me rise again
now slowly leave my memory

chorus
what can i do
the river is overrun
were swimming in a flood you know
i thought i felt your touch
but the water is rising up
now all my lovers raise their cups
you might also likechorus
what can i do
the river is overrun
were swimming in a flood you know
i thought i felt your touch
but the water is rising up
now all my lovers raise their cups2embed"
