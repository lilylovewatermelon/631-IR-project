verse pitbull
when it comes to these hoes
yall know we on some halloween shit

but im on some galloween shit too
gettin messed up for the radication boom
from the palm trees to the red clay
we get down the same way
lil jons from scott but this little cubans
from the county of dade
pitbull is here to voice his opinion
and yall gone hear it
all up and down the eastside
imma show yall how dirty we ride
from dade to decatur
only difference is yall blow dro
and we blow crip
but reall theres is no difference
cause theyre both green and sticky
i dont mean to be picky
but jon tell your boys from the eastside
to put me down with one of those
redbone who has a pretty face n waist
and thick thighs
from the mia to the atl
