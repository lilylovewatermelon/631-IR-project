my diamonds hit harder when the light off
i ride private to my shows just a writeoff
this beat from murda murda

verse 1 lil baby
got a thousand pounds for a thousand buy them bitches now
first they tried to steal my style now they tryna steal my sound
thank god i aint been broke in a while
do what i do to a t you my child
i left the bitch in the field and she sour
move like a ghost in my town i got power
reach for a chain on my neck hear a baow
im hittin em hard make em throw in the towel
dont get em started if you ask me im the hardest
aint come to play with these boys i aint carti
amg big body sound like it farted
i hurt they feelings aint telling em sorry
these niggas boring im on some more shit
hundred racks spent on my teeth i like flossin
ran up ten million and still aint get cocky
fuck your opinion dont need it im poppin
told all the bros catch an opp then he droppin
everyone hot on my label got options
send your deposit we come to rock shit
breakin in cars my lil bro like a locksmith
that nigga throw it up he on them roxies
why you keep buyin these chains and these watches
how can i not every day i get profit
upped all my drip cause my crips be watchin
i really go from these projects to projects
they gotta take it with ease they cant stop it
fuck it aint letting em breathe they can die
think bout the bros every time i get high
free the guys
