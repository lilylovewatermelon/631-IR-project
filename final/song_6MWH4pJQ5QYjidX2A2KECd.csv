now when the sun come up
ill be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth
find that clip i been looking for since last night
i feel so caught up in the bud
i float somehow in my bedroom
turn around
see myself in the mirror i guess im cool
and those happy thoughts in my head
im feeling like im peter pan
minus the tights and the fairies
happy to see how far ive come
to the same place it began
my dreams and imagination
perfectly at peace
so i move along a bit higher

chorus
ill be upup and away upup and away
cause they gon judge me anyway so whatever
ill be upup and away upup and away
cause in the end theyll judge me anyway so whatever

verse 2
uh higher learnin
i see the dreams i made
so im cooler now
i can take care of my mom and my little niece zuri
so sing along lil mama
you aint gotta worry bout no drama no
i provide for friends and fam and fans
and cleveland city grinding man
stay afloat the key is hope
ill never let a motherfucker break me dawg
who gives a fuck if a nigga dont like your steeze
tell em to buzz off your nuts
we dont care what people say
dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
i aint gotta wait for no one
if i wanna fly i can fly for freedom hey

narration common
the end is never the end
a new challenge awaits
a test no man could be prepared for
a new hell he must conquer and destroy
a new level of growth he must confront himself
the machine and the ghost within
this is the journey of the man on the moon40embed"
