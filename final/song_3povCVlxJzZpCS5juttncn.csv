around the block an airborne blight
but looking on the brighter side
theres far less to which id be obliged

in the meadow where the black breeze blows
where underneath the waves you were most alone
can you hear a subtle aching tone
through the water through the earth to chill the bone

looking on the brighter side
looking on the brighter side
looking on the brighter side
