can i hit ya later cause this my jam
rollin in my beat up gold trans am
sorry i cant hear you and i got plans
you wont get me naked you had your chance

i know i said i wouldnt talk about you publicly but
that was before i caught you lying and cheating on me slut
i was down for you hardcore
while you were out tryna score

i heard our song on the radio
and id see your face everywhere i go
