dont look to a stranger
you know in the end ill always be there
but when youre in doubt
and when youre in danger
take a look all around and ill be there
im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
but if you wait around a while ill make you fall for me
i promise i promise you i will
when your day is through
and so is your temper
you know what to do
im gonna always be there
sometimes if i shout
its not whats intended
these words just come out
with no gripe to bear
im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
but if you wait around a while ill make you fall for me
i promise i promise you i will
