chorus
scrape it out the pot when i cook it
scrape it out the pot when i cook it
scrape it out the pot when i cook it
scrape it out the pot when i cook it
make me have to cook it off the counter
make me have to serve you with the hammer
make me have to put it in the freezer
make me have to put it in a pamper
bakin is all you heard whippin cocaine up is all you heard
bakin is all you heard whippin cocaine up is all you heard
bakin is all you heard whippin cocaine up is all you heard
whippin cocaine up is all you heard
came in the house and its all you heard

verse 1
cookin up chicken like gladys
stayin up late on addies
pullin up swervin hellcaty
fucked around caught me a baddie
cranberry guts with the matic
throw half a brick at magic
185 on a monday
ima renegade with the money
like the way i scrape that butter
betty crocker sippin on muddy
straight droppin gon get flooded
pyrex pot and the 40
thisll get a slow trap scorchin
if it aint hot it aint rollin
twentyfour seven aint closin
they got my name at the precinct
know a nigga playin in a sink
came through playin in a mink
dont put the fan on its gon shrink
i put a lotta bands on another rinse
got a lotta bands on me outta drench
i got rerock on me got fish
i got a kilo cuban on my wrist
i served junkies then i made a hit
i got my fork and my work and my syrup
i got my recipe goin
you see me just splashin and play with that girl
you already know what im doin

scrape it out the pot when i cook it

verse 2
i just whipped up a new saleen
i just whipped up a maserati truck
cookin by the sink with the fire up
burned down the house call the fire truck
oil base got me scrapin louder
might even take a lil longer
took a few losses with the caine
arm  hammer made me stronger
watch for the do count up this fo
we ran outta sandwich bags go get some mo
you aint put in the work and you homeless
i stash the work in the honda
remixin to keep it one hunnda
came in the house and its all you heard
splash splash all you heard
whippin cocaine up is all you heard
splash splash all you heard
count up this cash and all you heard
