i opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
walking down by the bay on the shore
staring up at the stars that arent there anymore
i was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
so like an introvert i drew my over shirt
around my arms and began to shiver violently before
you happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
running into the dark underground
all the subways around create a great sound
to my motion fatigue farewell with your ear to a seashell
you can hear the waves in underwater caves
as if you actually were inside a saltwater room

chorus adam young  breanne duren
time together is just never quite enough
when you and i are alone ive never felt so at home
what will it take to make or break this hint of love
only time only time

verse 2 adam young
can you believe that the crew has gone
and they wouldnt let me sign on
all my islands have sunk in the deep
so i can hardly relax or even oversleep
but i feel warm with your hand in mine
when we walk along the shoreline
i guess well never know why sparrows love the snow
well turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likeinterlude adam young  breanne duren
so tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love
yeah all the time
all the time

chorus adam young  breanne duren
time together is just never quite enough
when you and i are alone ive never felt so at home
what will it take to make or break this hint of love
only time only time
when were apart whatever are you thinking of
if this is what i call home why does it feel so alone
so tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love
all the time all the time

outro adam young  breanne duren
time together is just never quite enough
when were apart what ever are you thinking of
what will it take to make or break this hint of love
so tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love
all the time
oh all the time7embed"
