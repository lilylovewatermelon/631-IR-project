one time i tried to sing
about spring and a storm
but you know how it goes
blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah
all along
wont you please stop complaining
im playing a song

chorus 1
but all the rain comes down the same
falling to from where it came
on the ground and back around up into the sky

verse 2
i wish you couldve heard the music
when the clouds growled overhead
i finally felt enthusiastic i finally felt alive
blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah
so you said
would it please you to listen
to thunder instead

chorus 2
man the rain came down that day
and it drained my soul away
and i wondered why i even bothered to try

mr moon
yeah
tell us about the sky
the sky is deep and dark and eternally high
many people think thats where you go when you die
do you
well i think you return to obscure
or wherever you were before you were
but i wont let you lose yourself in the rain

chorus 3
we have so much left to sing
theres a storm for every spring
all you see and you and me became from a star
youre a star youre a star
youre a star youre a star
youre a star youre a star

outro
silent explosive and silent explosive
and silent explosive and silent explosive
create until nothing is left to create
and the universe bursts with an overworked sigh
and pretend to pretend to recrown the creation
and sing the same thing til the clouds start to cry
and then over and over and over again
and then over and over and never again21embed"
