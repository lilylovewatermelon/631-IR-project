one more time i have crossed the line
now you wont be mine anymore
one more dream vanished up in smoke
now i have no hope anymore

chorus
let it go the damage in your heart
let it go the damage in your heart
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel

verse 2
one more tear falling down your face
doesnt mean that much to the world
one more loss in a losing life
doesnt hurt so bad anymore

chorus
let it go the damage in your heart
let it go the damage in your heart
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel

guitar solo

one more tear falling down your face
doesnt mean that much to the world

chorus
let it go the damage in your heart
let it go the damage in your heart
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel
i cant tell you how the words have made me feel

i cant tell you i cant tell you
i cant tell you how the words have made me feelembed"
