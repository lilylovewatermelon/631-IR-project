1jXwAcva0xhC09Vc1hf4pF,You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,Brad Paisley,6em0G4V4kU9mRweKkCefgR,"6 contributorsyouâ€™ll never leave harlan alive lyricsverse 1
in the deep dark hills of eastern kentucky
thats the place where i trace my bloodline
and its there i read on a hillside gravestone
you will never leave harlan alive

oh my granddads dad walked down
katahrins mountain
and he asked tillie helton to be his bride
said wont you walk with me out of the mouth
of this holler
or well never leave harlan alive

chorus
where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
and the sun goes down about three in the day
and you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew youre drinking
and you spend your life just thinking of how to get away

verse 2
no one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
till a man from the northeast arrived
waving hundred dollar bills he said ill pay ya for your minerals
but he never left harlan alive

granny sold out cheap and they moved out west
of pineville
to a farm where big richland river winds
i bet they danced them a jig laughed and sang a new song
who said wed never leave harlan alive
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebut the times got hard and tobacco wasnt selling
and ole granddad knew what hed do to survive
he went and dug for harlan coal
and sent the money back to granny
but he never left harlan alive

chorus
where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
and the sun goes down about three in the day
and you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew youre drinking
and you spend your life just thinkin of how to get away
where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
and the sun goes down about three in the day
and you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew youre drinking
and you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave

verse 3
in the deep dark hills of eastern kentucky
thats the place where i trace my bloodline
and its there i read on a hillside gravestone
you will never leave harlan alive1embed"
