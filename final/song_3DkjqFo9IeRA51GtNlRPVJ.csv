little bit of molly make the boy bite down
thinkin i could finally figure out my style on the stage
lookin at a big hype crowd
they go insane when i run out on the stage
cause we dont give a fuck dont need to act our age hey

blessed with some success so ima try my best to
live my life right when i see god hell be impressed cause
