but i miss the taste of it

you said time heals
theres not enough of it

the lessons are too cruel to keep
to lock the door to hide the key

to hear you cast a spell so sweet
to still have hours left to sleep

your fear is crowdin
and there is still
no place
for someone
like me to fill
dont know about luck
but i know the lack of it

dont know about luck
but im losing track of it

the lessons are too cruel to keep
to lock the door to go to sleep
you might also likei know that time until it kills
youre giving me the chills

your fear is crowdin
and there is still
no place
for someone
like me to fill

the lessons are too cruel to keep
to lock the door to hide the key

to hear you cast a spell so sweet
and still have hours left to sleep

your fear is crowdin
and there is still
no place
for someone

x2

the lessons are too cruel to keep
to lock the door to go to sleep
i know that time until it kills
youre giving me the chills

i know that time until it kills

youre giving me the chills
youre giving me the chills
youre giving me the chills1embed"
