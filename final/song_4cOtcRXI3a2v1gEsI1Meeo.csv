that youre my every dream
yet youre afraid each thing i do
is just some evil scheme

a memory from your lonesome past
keeps us so far apart
why cant i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart

another love before my time
made your heart sad and blue
and so my heart is paying now
for things i didnt do

in anger unkind words i said
that make the teardrops start
why cant i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart

there was a time when i believed
that you belonged to me
but now i know your heart is shackled
to a memory

the more i learn to care for you
the more we drift apart
why cant i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heartsee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
