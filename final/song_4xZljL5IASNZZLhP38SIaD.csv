just to hold you would be the greatest thing
just spinnin around to the sound of the jukebox so low
and as the time fades i pray that it goes by slow

oh sing for me junction city queen
well you sound like an angel so it seems
cause everything stops as we pray you dont go
in the mornin back to ohio
but i find myself with empty arms
and a head thats full of dreams
of my junction city queen

wont you wait for me junction city queen
well im headed that way and im pickin up steam
and i know for a while ill be fine until i must leave
and wait for the next time that i see my queensee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like2embed"
