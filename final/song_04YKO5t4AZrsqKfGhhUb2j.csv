mama always said i was born on the wild side
one foot in the flames and the other trying to walk the line
cant say i never saw it coming i could see the warning signs
mama always said i was born on the wild side
i guess mama was right
cause when the clock strikes midnight

chorus
gonna ride the lightning feel the thunder
til the darkness pulls me under
gonna fly on wings of fire
pray the good lord lifts me higher
singing oh when they call me home
singing oh when they call me home
im gonna ride the lightning

verse 2
therеs a man in a black coat standing at a crossroads
with a pad in his hand and a long list of lost souls
they say he flips a coin forged out of fools gold
thеres a man in black coat standing at a crossroads
i hope he lets me pass by
and i close my eyes

chorus
im gonna ride the lightning feel the thunder
til the darkness pulls me under
gonna fly on wings of fire
pray the good lord lifts me higher
singing oh when they call me home
singing oh when they call me home
im gonna ride the lightning ride the lightning ride the lightning
