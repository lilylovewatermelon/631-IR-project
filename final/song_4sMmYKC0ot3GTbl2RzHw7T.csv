verse
i hope you find somebody more toxic
and yall go through way more arguments than we did
y’all go through way more arguments than needed
you better give him the same fuckin treatment
i know its just the intro and this shit get deep but
i’ve got my reasons
i put my work in it wasnt worth it
my stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
i made you worth it for somebody else
i endured all of your flaws til i broke through all the walls of your guard
now youre perfect for somebody else
im bout to call her bruh i aint gon lie
i know she’s somewhere with a good guy no
she’s out with a guy who push a pretty penny
her friend just let me know she said he gets more paper than me yeah damn
there goes my ego
this shit is weak though
my heart is cold this shit is brick
my shit is shaq at the freethrow
tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
and you dont even peep though
i let you take ’til there was nothing left of me
i seen it all til there was nothing left to see
i know she would leave me what you telling me
cause when its said and done all i got is these melodies
you wasn’t there when i was selling cds

but through these toxic eyes i see potential
took advantage of the fact you got to
