got off a plane to the countryside
i drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
there was crack on the corner and someone dead
and fire coming out of a monkeys head

chorus the london community gospel choir
dont get lost in heaven
they got locks on the gate
dont go over the edge
youll make a big mistake

verse 2 2d
put me in a cab to suburbia
i just took a line but it wasnt with ya
there was more of it there when i got back home
but youd left me you dont know my soul
youre a ho girl
yeah youre a hobo

chorus the london community gospel choir
dont get lost in heaven
they got locks on the gate
dont go over the edge
youll make a big mistake
