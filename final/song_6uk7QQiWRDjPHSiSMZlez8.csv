i know a girl from an island
she stands apart from the crowd
she loves the sea and her people
she makes her whole family proud
sometimes the world seems against you
the journey may leave a scar
but scars can heal and reveal just
where you are

the people you love will change you
the things you have learned will guide you
and nothing on earth can silence
the quiet voice still inside you
and when that voice starts to whisper
moana youve come so far
moana listen do you know who you are

moana spoken
who am i

sung
i am a girl who loves my island
and the girl who loves the sea it calls me
i am the daughter of the village chief
we are descended from voyagers
who found their way across the world
they call me
you might also likeive delivered us to where we are
i have journeyed farther
i am everything ive learned and more
still it calls me
and the call isnt out there at all
its inside me
its like the tide
always falling and rising
i will carry you here in my heart
youll remind me
that come what may
i know the way
i am moana7embed"
