i knew you when
i had a friend
very deeply
love lived within
but somehow we got loose
from what was oh so tight
somewhere we went wrong
when we were oh so right

prechorus
whats a man to do when he just cant take no more
oh whats a man to do
what am i to do when my heart leads me to the door
now ive tried and tried again
but now this is the end
tell me whats the use of holding on
if we cant be friends
