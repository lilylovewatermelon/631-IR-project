down to earth in the dirt
used em up so im out of words
barely breathing
still alive as samurais cut me up and then down the sides
stop the bleeding

prechorus 1
did i say say i know anything cause i dont
but i will pay pay double just to get what i want

chorus
i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah
i keep swinging
makes no sense but i go again
cause i i might just be dumb enough to keep on trying til i die
and i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah

verse 2
steady odds in the eyes out of luck but i roll the dice
still believing
keep the faith no time to pray warming up for a hail mary
got that feeling

prechorus 2
did i say say i know anything cause i dont
yeah but playing safe safe isnt really playing at all
at all

i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah
i keep swinging
makes no sense but i go again
cause i i might be just dumb enough to keep on trying til i die
and i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences

bridge
and its hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
and its harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
and a light in the dark is all you wanna see you wanna see
and its hard when the fire keeps crawling up your sleeves
and its harder than you ever thought that it could ever be
and a light in the dark is all you wanna see all you wanna see

chorus
i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah
i keep swinging
makes no sense but i go again
cause i i might be just dumb enough to keep on trying til i die
and i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah
i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fences ah
i keep swinging
makes no sense but i go again
cause i i might be just dumb enough to keep on trying til i die
and i keep swinging for the fences ah for the fencesembed"
