if youre the bird
whenever we pretend its summer
then im the worm
i know the part its such a bummer
but fair is fair
if my segments get separated
ill scream
and youll be there
close your eyes
close my eyes
slide the cotton off of your shoulder
and feel the shine
feel the shine
im hooked so toss me over
and cast the line
well ill try
ill throw a party and greet my undersea friends
it depends
as they arrive
if they arrive

chorus
you and i left our troubles far behind
troubles far behind
but i still have just one more question on my mind
for all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
with friends like these well
who needs enemies
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likeverse 2
if im your boy
lets take a shortcut we remember
and well enjoy
picking apples in late september like
weve done for years
then well take a long walk
through the cornfield
and ill kiss you
between the ears
if youre my girl
swirl me around your room with feeling
and as we twirl
the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
will shine for us
as love sweeps over the room
because we tend to make
each other blush
you make me blush

chorus
you and i left our troubles far behind
troubles far behind
but i still have just one more question on my mind
for all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
with fronds like these well
who needs anemones
outro
youre the bird im the worm
and its plain to see
that we were meant to be
we were meant to be
we were meant to be
if youre the bird
if youre the bird
then im the worm
we were meant to be6embed"
