verse 1
you wanna hear my side
you need to drown to know
with all the times it hurt me to fuck you
i built a wall with your blood to show

chorus
god save us
god save us all
god hates us
god hates us all

verse 2
nothing to heal no one to break
pills had a role now theres nothing to take
nothing to trust no one to fake
youll find out sooner that its best if we just know our place
my infiltrated mind my lacerated soul
it took me years create me control you
i left myself for an idea i stole
