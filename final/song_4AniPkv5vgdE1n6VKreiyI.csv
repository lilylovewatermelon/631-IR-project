verse 1
the smell of your skin lingers on me now
youre probably on your flight back to your hometown
i need some shelter of my own protection baby
be with myself and center
clarity peace serenity

chorus
i hope you know i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
its personal myself and i
we got some straightening out to do
and im gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
but ive got to get a move on with my life
its time to be a big girl now
and big girls dont cry
dont cry dont cry dont cry

verse 2
the path that im walking i must go alone
i must take the baby steps til im full grown full grown
fairytales dont always have a happy ending do they
