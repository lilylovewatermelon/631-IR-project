i awake to find no peace of mind
i said how do you live as a fugitive
down here where i cannot see so clear
i said what do i know
show me the right way to go

chorus
and the spies came out of the water
but youre feelin so bad cause you know
that the spies hide out in every corner
but you cant touch them no
cause theyre all spies
theyre all spies

verse 2
i awake to see that no one is free
were all fugitives look at the way we live
down here i cannot sleep from fear no
i said which way do i turn
oh i forget everything i learn

chorus
and the spies came out of the water
and youre feelin so bad cause you know
that the spies hide out in every corner
but you cant touch them no
cause theyre all spies
theyre all spies

and if we dont hide here
theyre gonna find us
and if we dont hide now
theyre gonna catch us where we sleep
ah and if we dont hide here
theyre gonna find us

outro
and the spies came out of the water
but youre feelin so good cause you know
that those spies hide out in every corner
they cant touch you no
cause theyre just spies
theyre just spies
theyre just spies
theyre just spies
theyre just spies18embed"
