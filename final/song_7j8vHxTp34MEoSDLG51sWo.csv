verse 1
activation activation
maturation process rap game too saturated
grab your lady masturbation on her face
an acne patient acting patient so complacent
comfortable a basic bowl of shit
hold my own i own my dick
go shalom i’m unpredictable
and roll with the clique and fold with big clips
i know im feelin activated when i came in this bitch
claiming the 6 i don’t care about being famous and shit
i was a bad little never had nigga get the bag
give it back to my fam boy i am who i am
hope i dont get in a jam in a jam
had a dream of eating lamb in the lam
and the label come off fam with the ram
like martin gina cole tommy and pam
start scheming boy you die where you
you might also likebeat switch

interlude jamaican dj
now hear dis you likkle spit and chew out soundbwoy
you mussi think you can go buy experience a woolworth
you mussi think a so king selassie ah get him crown
no no no
no no no no way
you got to work hard for it

verse 2
look okay
this the type of shit that have niggas in beef
dat slick talk followed by some stick talk then sleep
pissed off i done took my fifth loss this week
big dog i can scratch that shit off like fleas
i got a lotta shit to say but ima keep my list short
i know alotta your favorites not gon fuck with this part
when im done please know that i was trying to diss yall
cause if this is a competition then i’m setting this bar
in my city who’s with me im in my own lane jack
niggas said jid so flame i propane rap
i’m from east atlanta like gucci and travis porter
but my story is similar to the hare and the tortoise
pen so sharp told stories you thought i forged it
back in the fourth grade never read curious jorge
my nigga corey kept a little 40 inside his north face
left a nigga with no face and beat the court case
coming home from ball practice took the street the short way
we from the east but never gave niggas a reason
to try it or think its easy soft pussy niggas eat the sorbet
or eating your face or squeeze the heat then leaving your place
ive been telling you lifes a bitch but it’s a beach in your case
ive been yelling and throwing fits im tired of screaming all day
ive been fighting these fucking demons all day
man this shit aint never been easy maybe i just need a breather
hand your boy the blower let me squeeze it
blow a little steam i aint hating im just heated
niggas know what i mean but niggas dont know what i been through
so if i offend you then uhh uhh uhh uhh
chorus
i heard niggas looking for a problem
but we dont even move until the rent due
my niggas hands itching finna rob something
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you our father
better pray to god
verse 3
look okay
fuck what a nigga say or look my mama think i made it
lift my head to the skies i cry and begin prayer
thanks to the maker got me out of an awful place
my nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
more than a motivator for me to get off my anus
and kick ass like im danny mainus
put the pen pad to the paper big mad with a painting brush
splish splash drawing scenes from my dim lit past
dimwit pimp shit syndicate with the pen grip
ripping shit intimate infinite rhyme kicking lllets begin
whos your list your top 10 you can say whoever better than
im ready now i was ready then i was headed down the aisle
rap game in a wedding gown she gave me the ring
i said yes and vowed for forever now
on the honeymoon getting naked now
on a money pile doing doggystyle
im a father now and you are my child
or you arent my child im on maury now
and im talking loud the results are found
you are not the wow i should kill this bitch like a doggy pound
we divorcing now
i want the cars ring clothes all the house
and you broke my heart im reorganizing
and really trying to be mature about it
but i gotta kill it like a fucking villain
dreamvillain spillvillain rhyme to the ceiling
would i should i kill a rapper cause i coulda
duh nigga this a gun and a bullet
chorus
i heard niggas looking for a problem
but we dont even move till the rent due
my niggas hands itching finna rob something
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you
better pray to god that he dont get you

outro
