i waited all my life to play
i still cant find a way
but if i work it one more day
i might just break the chain
i might just break the chain
i might just break the chain

verse 1 lupe fiasco
freedom we can use some of that especially where we from
where we grew up like a green thumb
its like a criminal is the only thing you can become
look at what i became
something like a phenom nuthin but a g thang
things ive seen when im looking out of these frames
pictures i painted on the walls where we hang
from the trees we hung
strange fruit man look at how we swung
how the hell you gonna tell a son
who aint have a father
how to try to grow up and be one
see um feel it in my bones
that im sitting on a throne
like a killer with a chrome
when i spit another poem
shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home pow

verse 2 sway
super swah the cape remains thought i was mia no paper
planes im fly plus i dont write no more its all off of the top i shaved the braids
and stayed sharp mother knew how to raiseablade razor blade
i paid my dues now i wait for change and the flows so rude it goes without
ask lupe im sucre i aid the break
quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai i like to travel light
ive gotta leave you at home delilah

verse 3 lupe fiasco
chain broke nicorette for your chain smoke
no cigarrettes on my plane yo
snatching herringbones from the game throat
put it on mine take a long time
ba baracus is how im looking online
in the webisode necklace stole let em know
that i put up the footage that im takin your shine
wanna see the real chains look in your mind
your brain look like keenan wayans brother
overgold overload broken soul
niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuckup
playa thinkin that its cool to be a pimp still
we gon set it free like a fish in a pimp heel
take this home rearrange it change it
danger swayzer lupe laser pow

i still cant find a way
but if i work it one more day
i might just break the chain
