gave you one hundred strikes you was askin for it and your wish was granted
felt like you would jeopardize what i had goin nigga i couldnt chance it
and i know you bitchmade so i dont expect you to understand it
i know you furious cause im banded up and my diamonds dancing
hoppin out of first class in another state my plane just landed
all you had to do was play your role i wouldntve left you stranded
aint how i wanted shit to go that wasnt the way i planned it
cause i been there before know what its like to feel abandoned

verse 1
why everybody think that i owe em somethin that shit be strange
it aint my fault that you fucked up i aint the one to blame
still aint got off your ass yet all you did was complain
grown ass man lookin for a handout you should be ashamed
once you stop fuckin with em they start throwin dirt all on your name
but every nigga deep in my circle know that im still the same
i always kept it a hundred so how the fuck i change
no i never been the type to go against the grain
aint wanna cut you off you dont think that caused me pain
i had to separate myself and just stay in my lane
everybody aint real lot of niggas just be in this shit for fame
that social media been fuckin up these niggas brains
theyll sell they soul for a lil attention man that shit be lame
did certain shit that you cant take back and you cant explain
been tryna keep my composure they gon make me go insane
might put them shooters on your ass and they got perfect aim
you might also likechorus
gave you one hundred strikes you was askin for it and your wish was granted
felt like you would jeopardize what i had goin nigga i couldnt chance it
and i know you bitchmade so i dont expect you to understand it
i know you furious cause im banded up and my diamonds dancing
hoppin out of first class in another state my plane just landed
all you had to do was play your role i wouldntve left you stranded
aint how i wanted shit to go that wasnt the way i planned it
cause i been there before know what its like to feel abandoned

verse 2
nigga for my family did what i did i dont need validation
my mama the only one ever came to bond me up out that station
sittin in that cell i used to feel like my potential wasted
i finally know what the top feel like i come from that basement
everybody latching on tryna benefit from my situation
i ran that bag up you in your head making up calculations
every time i look up its a soft ass nigga clout chasing
i grinded hard for the spot i got they wish we traded places
im living lavish now and i guess you wanted an invitation
im tryna understand what make you think that im obligated
no i cant kick it with you no more my nigga that ball deflated
i knew you was never really rootin for me i used to peep the hatin
so many times i was in denial but i just had to face it
gave you an inch you took a mile now look what i created
always lookin for your cut worried bout what im makin
posted with you thats what i went through on a daily basis
chorus
gave you one hundred strikes you was askin for it and your wish was granted
felt like you would jeopardize what i had goin nigga i couldnt chance it
and i know you bitchmade so i dont expect you to understand it
i know you furious cause im banded up and my diamonds dancing
hoppin out of first class in another state my plane just landed
all you had to do was play your role i wouldntve left you stranded
aint how i wanted shit to go that wasnt the way i planned it
cause i been there before know what its like to feel abandoned12embed"
