how does hamilton
an arrogant
immigrant orphan
bastard whoreson
somehow endorse
thomas jefferson his enemy
a man he’s despised since the beginning
just to keep me from winning
i wanna be in the room where it happens—

burr and company
the room where it happens
the room where it happens

burr
you’ve kept me from—

burr and company
the room where it happens

burr
for the last time
dear alexander
you might also likei am slow to anger
but i toe the line
as i reckon with the effects
of your life on mine
i look back on where i failed
and in every place i checked
the only common thread has been your disrespect
now you call me “amoral”
a “dangerous disgrace”
if you’ve got something to say
name a time and place
face to face
i have the honor to be your obedient servant
a dot burr
hamilton
mr vice president
i am not the reason no one trusts you
no one knows what you believe
i will not equivocate on my opinion
i have always worn it on my sleeve
even if i said what you think i said
you would need to cite a more specific grievance
here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements
burr
sweet jesus

hamilton
hey i have not been shy
i am just a guy in the public eye
tryin’ to do my best for our republic
i don’t wanna fight
but i won’t apologize for doing what’s right
i have the honor to be your obedient servant
a dot ham

burr
careful how you proceed good man
intemperate indeed good man
answer for the accusations i lay at your feet or
prepare to bleed good man

hamilton
burr your grievance is legitimate
i stand by what i said every bit of it
you stand only for yourself
it’s what you do
i can’t apologize because it’s true
burr
then stand alexander
weehawken dawn
guns drawn

hamilton
you’re on

burr and hamilton
i have the honor to be your obedient servant
hamilton
a dot ham

burr
a dot burr23embed"
