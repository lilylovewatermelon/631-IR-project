saw him sitting on a sidewalk in fresno
braided hair and a tiedyed tshirt on
talking to himself about vietnam
about the tour he did and the deal he got
he said this world aint the same if you ask me
if i could be somewhere else ill tell you where id be

chorus
id be rolling on a river with credence
stealing kisses from peggy sue
id be kneedeep in sand on a panama beach in the spring of 72
id be wasting away on the dock of the bay
watching the tide roll in
he said what i wouldnt give just to live those songs again

verse 2
saw him working the counter at walgreens
with a new haircut and a bachelors degree
talking to himself about his raw deal
cursing uncle sam and the gi bill
he said this world aint the same if you ask me
if i could be somewhere else ill tell you where id be

chorus
id be rolling on a river with credence
stealing kisses from peggy sue
id be kneedeep in sand on a panama beach in the spring of 72
id be wasting away on the dock of the bay
watching the tide roll in
he said what i wouldnt give just to live those songs again

chorus
id be rolling on a river with credence
