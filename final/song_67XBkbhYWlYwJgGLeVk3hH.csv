thank god winters almost done
and im just getting sober
and it feels like im freezing in the california sun
christmas almost killed me
new years cold as philly
april fools i thought you were the one

pre chorus tony oller
now im holding on for dear life
skating through it on thin ice
and it just sucks how much im missing you
yeah

chorus
baby i hate
i freaking hate
valentines day
valentines day
im feeling this pain
it cuts like a blade when i think about you

its all a charade
a heartbreak holiday here without you

oh ive been deleting every trace
of when we were together
but ever since i kissed you
i just cant get out the taste
so i ate your box of chocolates
cause i knew you didnt want it
the way that i still want you what a waste
