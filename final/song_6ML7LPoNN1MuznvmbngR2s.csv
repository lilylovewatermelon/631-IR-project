verse one ludacris
you never know how much you miss a person until they gone
like to hear it hear it go im rehearsing gotta sing my song
i know ive done some wrong but i cant get right
cause life is like a big fight
im stickinandmovin tryin to get my shit right
my familys been houndin me friends they done turned against me
kinda like they hearts was on a full tank but now they empty
and they say ive changed but like twins im just the same
its because of my job mo money mo prob in this dirty game
this industry fucked up
thats right i said it and its fake as ever
keep real niggas around me stay space age 4 eva
poppa never went and jumped the broom never got that one degree
but if you looked down from heaven youd still be proud of me
your son was dui but my momma made it by
i didnt shed no tears when you left me
but the rest of the family cried
trials and tribulations ruined my concentration
losin my patience hard times for goodness saken

verse two 8ball
as this valium slowly starts to kick in
them subconcious subliminal thoughts start tickin
this whole world around me diseased and crumblin
babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
sittin up in the court talkin bout eminem made me do what i did
my own hard times rolled in like the fog
try to think of others but i cant get past my own thoughts
my momma in 1967 pickin cotton
while other blacks was gettin liberated boycottin
my old man was a player aint no hidin that
he started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack
i never saw him never needed to see that muhfucker
he left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter
i tattooed it on my arm so i cant forget it
its in my mind and my heart so im forever with it

verse three mjg
a drum machine the old fotrack and a pack of new tapes
in the middle of 1988 in a corner cafe
we made beats and hung with old heads and stayed out late at night
do talent shows foway split the dough that was our way of life
my momma stayed home fulltime so she could raise me
knowin without a household father things could get crazy
sometimes i listened sometimes i thought i knew it all
but nevertheless momma was with me through it all
i graduated out of nothin not out of school
it was like 12 13 14 years im thinkin cool
i might as well be focusin on me tryin to get paid
usin these rhymes ive been writin since in the 7th grade
our team played and had physical sex with minimum wage
it was just like a piece of pussy
it fucked me long as i stayed
but still i prayed lord im drownin please help me out the water
it cant get no harder
help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow
chorus carl thomas
im tryin to make it through these hard times hard times
