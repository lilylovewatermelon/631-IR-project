im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
i threw my phone across the room at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning i said we should talk about it
cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said okay lets talk

chorus
and i said stay stay stay
ive been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that its funny when im mad mad mad
but i think that its best if we both stay

verse 2
before you id only dated selfindulgent takers
who took all of their problems out on me
but you carry my groceries and now im always laughing
and i love you because you have given me

chorus
no choice but to stay stay stay
ive been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that its funny when im mad mad mad
but i think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
you took the time to memorize me
my fears my hopes and dreams
i just like hanging out with you
all the time
all those times that you didnt leave
its been occurring to me
id like to hang out with you
for my whole life

chorus
stay
and ill be loving you for quite some time
no one else is gonna love me when i get mad mad mad
so i think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
stay stay stay
ive been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that its funny when im mad mad mad
but i think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
stay stay stay
ive been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that its funny when im mad mad mad
but i think that its best if we both stay
