with your deaf ears
open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
what do you want from a life of the hopeless
now here you are youre begging and crying
i want to fly yeah im flying till morning
running away to the land of discovery
running away from the suffering im gone yeah
running away from the darkness im out here yeah

chorus
higher than all the limits
going way beyond the noise and your feelings
when you speak all i can hear is silence
running back from all the pain and violence
big tunes now its big tunes im killing
cry now from the side now call my name
fall down when you see me you know that
you know that i will stay for you
i will wait for you for you
i will wait for you i will wait for you7embed"
