you alone can possess me
no one else can caress me
i belong to your heart

i belong to your heart
with devotion unseen
every part of my being
is a part of your heart

and when you reach out for me
your two arms are a magnet
and im caught in the dragent
oh but who wants to be free
and when you kiss me i know
that for now and all time
i just have to be yours my love
you just have to be mine

i belong to your heart
like the sun to the day
like the stars to the night
i belong to your heart
as i kneel at your throne
say you love me alone
let me hear from your heart my love
that i belongyou might also likeembed"
