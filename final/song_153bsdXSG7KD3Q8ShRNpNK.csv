last night it came as a picture
with a good reason a warning sign
this place is void of all passion
if you can imagine its easy if you try
believe me i failed this effort
i wrote a reminder this wasnt a vision
this time where are you houston
is somebody out there will somebody listen

chorus tom delonge
should i go back should i go back should i
i feel alone and tired
should i go back should i go back should i
i hope i wont forget you

verse 2 tom delonge
my head is made up of memories
most of them useless delusions
this room is bored of rehearsal
and sick of the boundaries i miss you so much

chorus tom delonge
should i go back should i go back should i
i feel alone and tired
should i go back should i go back should i
this time i dont want to
should i go back should i go back should i
i feel alone and tired
should i go back should i go back should i
i hope i wont forget you
