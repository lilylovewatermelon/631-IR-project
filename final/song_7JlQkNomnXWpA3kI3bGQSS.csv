welcome to the world you see
an ak with a couple magazines
whose blood it is dont matter to me
scatter the ashes of the seven seas
that sickness that feeling inside you
thats weakness dont let it divide you
keep this that feeling of pride too
digging up bones whilst you bury the truth
your children hypocrisy
thats what i give you can take it from me
if you dont well live to see
one last act of tragedy
no mothers heart can make me humble
no life lost can make me stumble
our empire will never crumble

chorus danny
we did it for the glory
the glory only the glory
we live and die the story
its our story all for the glory

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
bullets begin to strip
a man of reason hes a man of sin
the men of treason are the ones who live
theyll take what youve got what youve got to give
an empire a trial by fire
there are liars lighting funeral pyres
a letter to a mother from across the sea
a son in a box buried beneath
for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
for whom they smile when they put you to sleep
a deal with the devil is a deal with me
that deal is forever as long as you breathe
go forth child make us proud
honor is yours underground
know we loved you lay you down
you might also likechorus danny
we did it for the glory
the glory only the glory
we live and die the story
itâ€™s our story all for the glory

bridge danny  jdog
nobody runs nobody runs
nobody runs or makes it out alive
nobody runs nobody runs
nobody runs or makes it out alive
hearts beating faster running to the front lines
nobody runs or makes it out alive
look up to heaven as it rains from the sky
nobody runs or makes it out alive
out alive

chorus danny
because we did it for the glory
the glory only the glory
we live and die the story
its our story all for the glory

outro danny
the glory the glory the glory
we did it for the glory the glory all for the glory4embed"
