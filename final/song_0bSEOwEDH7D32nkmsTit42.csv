meadowlark fly your way down
i hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
for you to wear upon your fleecy down

chorus
my meadowlark sing to me

verse 2
hummingbird just let me die
inside the broken ovals of your olive eye
i do believe you gave it your best try

chorus
my hummingbird sing to me

humming bridge

chorus
my hummingbird sing to me

outro
dont believe a word that i havent heard
little children laughing at the boys and girls
the meadowlark singing to you each and every day
the arc light on the hillside and the market in the hayyou might also like2embed"
