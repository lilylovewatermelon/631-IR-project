shes a stonecold straightfaced killer and a lover
and she wont put up with another brute who only wants to bruise her
take her love and then abuse her

wont take no more wont take no more

if you take a swing does she swing back

heaven help ya the girl likes to fight
afraid of nothing and she carries a knife

instead of kisses you gave bruises
