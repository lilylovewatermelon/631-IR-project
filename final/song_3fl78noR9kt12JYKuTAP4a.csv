she said to me go steady on me
wont you tell me what the wise men said
when they came down from heaven
smoked nine till seven
all the shit that they could find

prechorus
but they couldnt escape from you
couldnt be free of you
and now they know theres no way out
and theyre really sorry now for what theyve done
they were three wise men just tryna have some fun

chorus
look whos alone now
its not me its not me
those three wise men
theyve got a semi by the sea
gotta ask yourself the question
where are you now
gotta ask yourself the question
where are you now

verse 2
really sorry now they werent to know
they got caught up in your talent show
with you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress
who just judge each other and try to impress

but they couldnt escape from you
couldnt be free of you
and now they know theres no way out
and theyre really sorry now for what theyve done
they were three wise men just tryna have some fun

chorus
look whos alone now
its not me its not me
those three wise men
theyve got a semi by the sea
gotta ask yourself the question
where are you now
gotta ask yourself the question
where are you now
