must be something theyre hiding
must be reasons that no one will dare to tell
must be something inside me
but i dont think so anymore
its hurting again now
and i dont need friends when i have foes like you
its hurting again now
its killing me to be here all alone

prechorus
go away
its all the same
theres more for me

chorus
as the world falls away and i cant find a reason
as the world turns to grey
its killing me unwillingly and i am just the same as you

verse 2
must be something confided
must be someway to feel the pain and heal again
pain and pleasure inviting
i dont think so anymore
its hurting again now
and i dont need pills when i have drugs like you
its hurting again now
its killing me to be here all alone
