a banker and a farmer discuss the bottom line
it aint rained and all the crops are dying on the vine
give me more time you gotta give me more time

that farm has been in my family going on a hundred years
we pulled through hard times before with blood sweat and tears
give me more time i need more time
oh what would he give for a little more time

verse 3
two lovers at a table candlelight and wine
ones looking for an answer the other one cant find
give me more time you gotta give me more time

verse 4
she says you know i love you but my hearts in a bind
afraid youre gonna leave me if i dont make up my mind
give me more time i gotta have more time

bridge
some have barely any some too much on their hands
some would give anything to have it back again

verse 5
the patient and his doctor meet behind closed doors
