verse 1 luke
simmer down simmer down
they say were too young now to amount to anything else
but look around
we worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
if you dont swim youll drown
but dont move honey

chorus all
you look so perfect standing there
in my american apparel underwear
and i know now that im so down
your lipstick stain is a work of art
i got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
and i know now that im so down hey

verse 2 calum calum  michael calum  ashton
lets get out lets get out
cause this deadbeat towns only here just to keep us down
while i was out
i found myself alone just thinkin
if i showed up with a plane ticket
and a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
would you wanna run away too
cause all i really want is you
