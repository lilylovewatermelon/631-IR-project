somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and this i know
verse 1 kendrick lamar
i got 100 on my dash got 200 in my drum
name in the grab bags put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular im drunk
how come i can make them popular pop em when i want
see im livin with anxiety duckin the sobriety
fuckin up the system i aint fuckin with society
justice aint free therefore justice aint me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
once upon a time i used to go to church and talk to god
now im thinkin to myself hollow tips is all i got
now im drinkin by myself at the intersection parked
watch you when you walk inside your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your fuckin door and blowin out
every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
cut on the engine then sped off in the rain im gone
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likehook anna wise
somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
verse 2 punch  kendrick lamar
he drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin the handle
lit off henny im tryna dismantle
these wicked ways ive engaged in such a gamble
cause i could speak the truth and i know the world would unravel wait
thats a bit ambitious maybe im trippin
maybe im crazy maybe i exist in a different dimension
not to mention when i close my eyes i see the distance
its such a scary sight so i rarely go to sleep at night
i watch the sun rise then i watch the sun fall
studied the son of god and still dont recognize my flaws
i guess im lost the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
i pray my experience helps you
as for me im tryna sort it out
searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
but who knows
i just need a little space to breathe
i know perception is key so i am king
verse 3 kendrick lamar  jay rock
the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton they tell me that im blind
i know that im intelligent my confidence just died
carpe diem seize the day i cant compromise
a tapeworm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
a couple trinkets they seein me as i pacify
but couldnt fathom the meaning of seein sacrifice
im passin lives on the daily maybe im losing faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why im awake
im sleepwalkin im street stalkin im outta place
reinforcing this heat barking these are the brakes
before i blink do i see me before them pearly gates
or this is just a mirage or a facade
