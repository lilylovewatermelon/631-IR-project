first ill acknowledge all trust has been broken
a successful recovery i pray for us at night
bless me with a second chance never thought i’d see your face again
learn a lot through trial and error tryna make it right
make it right make it right
make it right this time ill do you right woah

verse 1
im missing your good intentions im missing you from a distance
hope you did the same
i know that i caused a problem know that i left you livid
pushed you far away
learned it don’t pay to lie cause i don’t wanna see you cry
saying nothing gets you nowhere fast imma hold it back inside
well now that im back around ya nothing else really matters
hope you feel the same

chorus
first ill acknowledge all trust has been broken
a successful recovery i pray for us at night
bless me with a second chance never thought i’d see your face again
learn a lot through trial and error tryna make it right
make it right make it right
make it right this time ill do you right woah

im going through old emotions tryna find a reason
that we ended that way
nothing in life is perfect well be changing like the seasons
thats what they used to say
if its going to sleep alone at night i don’t wanna close my eyes
wanna give you all i have to give no more holding back this time
well now that im back around ya nothing around me matters
hope you feel the same

chorus
first ill acknowledge all trust has been broken
a successful recovery i pray for us at night
bless me with a second chance never thought i’d see your face again
learn a lot through trial and error tryna make it right
make it right make it right
make it right this time ill do you right woah
