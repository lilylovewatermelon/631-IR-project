ok im leanin to the left flag in my right pocket
star trek fly unidentified flying objects
extraterrestrial im all about my decimals
retarded in the booth they say i got a special flow
sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
its simple mathematics you cut the check
and i rake in the green like im rakin the grass in
pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin
call my whip martin but the first name aston
potatohead niggas get mashed when im spazzin
think you fuckin with me put your cash in
nah i doubt it
i was young and reckless when p say he was about it
you niggas is ducks howards cowards
kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
this rap shit is ours gudda bitch

verse 2 lil wayne
uh uptown back in it hollygrove black menace
black clothes black tennis black semi
ive never sat in the hemi that will offend me
try maybach or maybach bitch i got stacks
yeah paychecks on paychecks and i still want payback
i still dont play that i kill on asap
and we dont do shit but get money all day
put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin your way
ym young mula young money all day
where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
which one of yall say you want drama im honored
i blitz yo ass like a mothafuckin lineman
stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas
still wear red like an old 49er
fuck shittin on ya dump the whole toilet on ya
weezy f baby bitch im hotter than uganda
uggh

momomma aint make me to make homies she made me to make history

bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
two things in the world i love  good head and victory

yeah im a big joker so you know ill smash your ace
leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
love is a gamble but its my casino
and tonight youre the loser i hope she got aveno
i hope the game got life insurance cause imma kill it
and all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it

popockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine

verse 4 tyga
say put the flow
say put the flow in the pot crank up the notch
burn the song from a stove top this finger lickin hot
his pick flip cause the nigga flopped
my shit hit like the pitch was soft niggas cottonballed
she dropped drawers cause she poppin off
her pussy crossed guard but i dont stop at all
i smash in the car like fuck the fuckin law
her baby daddy gone who wanna meet the don
that rocky shit up on the armarm
shittin on em like hay in the barn
hey wait they say money talks and man you dont speak at all
you shop at minimalls
my style two thumbs up like using analogs
ha ha i wreck shit for the recognition bitch
jesus as my witness saan vision
eyeball you niggas flame flicker
i melt pictures tyga skin aint drippin1embed"
