we both lost our innocence
to heaven or las vegas
bedroom rearranged again
and snow out on the pavement

prechorus
colors from outside
bathed in orange and white
lets invite your friends for a backseat drive

chorus
its not a crime if you take whats given
its just a crime if youre payin for it
whats the fun if you know whats comin
i dont want to escape it

verse 2
standing outside of your house
its pretty dark out
good thing theres lights
its pretty cold though
i just need you right here
to warm me up this time

prechorus
words turn to a cough
you say ill never get you off
now when you stand in a crowd
is your mind in the gutter
your head on the run
your head on the run
you might also likechorus
its not a crime if you take whats given
its just a crime if youre payin for it
whats the fun if you know whats comin
i dont want to escape it

bridge
the plant inside that never seemed to die
you cut it down before the leaves were brown
the gate was closed we know that were too old
the pool is cold the pool is cold

chorus 2
its not a crime if you take whats given
its just a crime if youre payin for it
whats the fun if you know whats comin
i dont want to escape this feeling
and when we tear down the walls completely
are we left with the same old memories
theres a song that i still hear faintly
its just a recipe for my love
its just a recipe for my love5embed"
