wake up dreamer
its happening without you
cut your hair and shave your beard
you squandered your chances

ill give you a thousand pounds
to show me how you do it
stop being so laissezfaire
were all scared of the future

verse 2
been training vipers to come for you
in your dreams to release you
been training vipers to come for you
in your sleep
and the ravens are leaving the tower
and the ravens are leaving the tower
and the ravens are leaving the tower
make your peace

chorus 1
ive got a taste for blood
leave the weak leave the young
ive got a taste for blood
im walking out without you
you will kill or be killed
its about progress
ive got a taste for blood
see bloc party liveget tickets as low as 86you might also likeverse 3
wake up sleepyhead
its happening without you
such a nice guy
you tell me everything twice

whip cracks we jump
we will run backwards
stop being so laissezfaire
were all scared of the future

chorus 2
we make plans for big times
get bogged down distracted
we make plans for good times
only young on surface
so kiss me before
it all gets complicated
ive got a taste for blood2embed"
