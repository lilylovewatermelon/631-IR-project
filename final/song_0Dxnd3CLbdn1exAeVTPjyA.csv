i wanna take you with me
to life with no more yesterdays
we can start again awake and so excited
and change the way we always push
we always push

chorus
ill open up and be your parachute
and ill never let you down
so open up and be my human angel
and well only hit the ground
running

verse 2
and when the world gets sharp and tries to cut you down to size
and makes you feel like giving in
oh i will stay i will rain i will wash the words and pain away
and i will chase away the way we push
the way we pull
youre beautiful

chorus
ill open up and be your parachute
and ill never let you down
so open up and be my human angel
and well only hit the ground
running running
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likebridge
and if it feels like we might drop
it will stop
so dont look down
it wouldnt be the same without you
this life is too good to give up on

chorus
ill open up and be your parachute
and ill never let you down
so open up and be my human angel
and well only hit the ground
and were gonna hit the ground
running runningembed"
