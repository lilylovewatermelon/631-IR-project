wed like to congratulate drugs for winning the war on drugs
bhristo talk to em slime

chorus
ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy but im happy i saw you today ayy cgm where you at
ayy ayy im a geekboy til im in a box
she got goth ho swag but its ricky
dont like when i buy her shit either want my money or she picky
but im happy i saw you today i been looking all through the city

verse
wanna ruin my day thats extra
got a soldout show pay extra
new deal on the way want a m
and the white folks know i got leverage
im a gemini lookin for a kim
got a few amber rose thats exes
im a drank head but i hate texas
kind of camera shy so i hate cali
met a bougie ass bitch thats messy
hellcats too loud for the valley
im a ken doll in love with a brat
know a few gi joes thatll wack you
and my pop so dark think its tris
four reds in the twenty ounce nasty
and i dont wear chrome unless its matty
and i make an appointment like trent
im a mob boss cant just hit me
get geeked like tune but its fenty
got a real boss bitch like flacko
shell wear my merch like fenty
finna cross my mans like alpo
put my grandmothers voice on the outro
doing one twenty all up the shoulder
i aint flirting with you death but were closer
giving luxury but junkie
cant stop gettin high with the money
and im happy i saw you today
i just know you finna ask me for money
on drugs they clear its simple
no ashtray fuck it its a rental
out of sight out of mind its mental
you might also likechorus
damn but im happy i saw you today
ayy ayy im a geekboy til im in a box
she got goth ho swag but its ricky
dont like when i buy her shit either want my money or she picky
but im happy i saw you today i been looking all through the city

outro
luxury but a junkie
give her luxury but a junkie
but im happy i saw you today
ayy ayy luxury but a junkie
give her luxury but a junkie
but im happy i saw you today
bhristo talk to em slime
ayy cgm where you atembed"
