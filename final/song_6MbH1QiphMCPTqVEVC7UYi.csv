you ever hear some slow tracks you know what im sayin
with like some pimpin to it or somethin
that you can relax pop a top to or somethin

verse 1 drake
big cup of ac im drowsy
im still posted up where you first found me
did i just read that you just got engaged on me
i heard from your friend you couldnt even tell me
or better yet wait on me

chorus drake

verse 2 drake
