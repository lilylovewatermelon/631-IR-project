i was reminiscing just the other day
while havin coffee all alone and lord it took me away
back to a firstglance feelin on new york time
back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light go
yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke wed made
and that was the first day

chorus
and darlin it was good
never lookin down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

verse 2
spinnin like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
wе block the noise with the sound of i need you
and for thе first time i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the storys got dust on every page
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
