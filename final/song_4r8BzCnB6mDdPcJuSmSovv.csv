part ii ea6

interlude spoken
like i’m more of myself than i’ve ever been
which is something that you really gotta come to face with sometimes
cus i thought i was you know fully myself 247
but nope like right now is how i’m supposed to feel all the time
its how i’m supposed to be all the time
its how i’m supposed to think all the time
now i know going out of this i know leaving this
that will follow me
it doesn’t you know end with this you know
i gotta take it and i live with it every day
i see the people around me and
i feel so much
i wanna put it in words
try and figure out where to go with it
but i just feel so much
i know they don’t even feel as much as i feel
but that’s alright
that’s alright
we have two different purposes
clearly my purpose is some shit that’s way fucking bigger than me
then it gets completely quiet when im at the beach
i know i’m one person but i kinda feel like this ripple effect is gonna impact a lot of people
i feel god talking and when he talks everything else is silent
verse 3
summer 2011
almost lost my faith in god
same time i never prayed so hard
took control of my life so i wouldn’t have to take no job
press play i couldn’t take no pause
i’m from east atlanta 6 they don’t play that shit
in east atlanta six you better make that lick
or they be at your front door with that gun doe
know them niggas nick cannon with the fucking drum roll
east side till a nigga die
beast mode till a nigga cry
sensei make a nigga fly
shit hard but you gotta try
if i can do it you can do it too
time to be a better guy
i found the answer ridin down candler
im late for court cause traffic on moreland
i’m trying to preach to yall what’s important
so hard for me to ignore ignorance
i don’t know why i feel it’s my place
i know you see the pain in my face
i call the shots and move at my pace
but i understand its all a big race
i understand you want that big face
they offering and hey
its hard for me to say
that i wouldn’t bite the bait they threw me
be cautious where you play
it’s darkness in the a

chorus
be cautious where you play
it’s darkness in the a
be cautious where you play
it’s darkness in the a
be cautious where you play
it’s darkness in the a

verse 4
atown stomp on the old me
used to ride through the hood with the slow creep
people gon love what they dont need
i remember what the ogs told me
you better shine bright when the lights down
less talk more show nigga pipe down
cause words aint shit but your thoughts out loud
and thoughts are the opposite of showin niggas how

chorus
be cautious where you play theres darkness in the a
be cautious where you play theres darkness in the a
be cautious where you play theres darkness in the a
be cautious where you play theres darkness in the a12embed"
