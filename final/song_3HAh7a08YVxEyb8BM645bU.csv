aue aue
we set a course to find
a brand new island everywhere we roam
aue aue
we keep our island in our mind
and when its time to find home we know the way

chorus 2 all  opetaia foai
aue aue
we are explorers reading every sign
we tell the stories of our elders in a neverending chain
aue aue
te fenua te mālie
nā heko hakilia
