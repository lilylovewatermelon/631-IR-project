midnight and the moon is out
careful you might hurt yourself
pleasure leads to pain
to me theyre both the same
sweat drippin down to the floor
bite marks like an animal
you might be insane
but maybe were the same

tonight you came here
cause you know what i need
and no one likes to be alone

i dont need a future i dont need your past
i just need a lover
so gimme what i want or ill give it to my
selfinflicted torture you dont have to ask
i just need a lover
so gimme what i want or ill give it to myself

verse 2

slow it down but you cant resist
beat your fantasy
