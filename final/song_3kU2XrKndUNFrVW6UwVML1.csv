just hear me out
if its not perfect ill perfect it til my heart explodes
i highly doubt
that i can make it through another of your episodes
lashing out
one of the petty moves you pull before you lose control
you wear me out
but its all right now

chorus
lets go home and get stoned
we could end up makin love instead of misery
go home and get stoned
cause the sex is so much better when youre mad at me
you wear me out
we could end up makin love instead of misery
but its all right now

verse 2
without a doubt
all the breakups worth the make up sex youre givin me
lets hash it out
cause your bitchin and your yellin dont mean anything
dont count me out
i can handle all the baggage that youre carrying
you wear me out
but its all right now

lets go home and get stoned
we could end up makin love instead of misery
go home and get stoned
cause the sex is so much better when youre mad at me
you wear me out
we could end up makin love instead of misery
but its all right now

bridge
lets go home and get stoned
we could end up makin love instead of misery
go home and get stoned
cause the sex is so much better when youre mad at me

outro
go home and get stoned
we could end up makin love instead of misery
go home and get stoned
cause the sex is so much better when youre mad at me
you wear me out
we could end up makin love instead of misery
but its all right now
cause the sex is so much better when youre mad at me
lets go home and get stoned
lets go home and get stoned
lets go home and get stoned
lets go home and get stoned3embed"
