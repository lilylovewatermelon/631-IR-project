ahahah hey
run that back turbo

chorus gunna
you niggas bogus i see the imposers
i used to sell yola trap on motorolla
spittin these vocals labels think i wrote it
slippery wet paints the coupes are candycoated
just left the bank i need a bag to hold this
the streets like a farm cause all we ride is horses
let my face tell it we done made a fortune
im ridin with my dawg and he aint gotta question

verse 1 gunna
i got a bitch like keisha off of belly
police got dogs and they cant even smell me
keep me a cup i got a lean belly
20s on me i call em green relish
balmain my jeans if not they embellished
too many vibes they think im r kelly
ph in the sky we got em already
pj in the sky and i dont wanna land it
creepin at night the vlone bandit
i prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
worked all my life and now i understand it
crawled up like a mouse but i could never tell it
i got the sweetest sauce like jelly
try disrespect me you all get beheaded
i got the drip they call me dripavelli
i held him down that nigga was my celly
fuck you fuck niggas devil made me heartless
thank god came and got me used to shop at target
they cut out the coupe before we hit the market
we dont pack our bags cause we gon shop regardless
backend im back in paid up for the party
i done came a long way from openin up for carti
shades and my bracelets cartier carti
polices cases all that we avoidin
the lean in my cup gettin more and more muddy
i shown all my love ive never been a bully
got every color vlone hoodie
just jumped in the game and still i aint no rookie
i got this sauce cream and puddin
i came with the drip got everybody lookin
cherish your blessings easily could be tooken
send a front in its easy to get a book in

i still rock the fitted but i dont be cappin skrrt
these camouflage denim like i just went campin
they still cant believe that i made it they happy

im ridin in the wraith like i play with the actors
no pleadin arraignment aint takin no charges
my young niggas solid i know that he got me
he keep his mouth closed ima buy him a foreign
penthouse hotel suite whenever were tourin
how foreign my tint is i still rock the jordan
packin out shows love my fans they important
and im still in the trap in the hood like a motor
spend thousands on fragrance she fuckin my odor
i just started rappin i made me some millions
man shout out atlanta im runnin my city
these bracelets came healthy they cost me a 50
i leveled it up ive been handlin business
gettin 20 a night every day different city
i just keep puttin this syrup in my kidneys
