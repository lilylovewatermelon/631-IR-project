im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go
im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go

verse 1
im a little bit sheltered
im a little bit scared
im a little bit nervous
im going nowhere
im a little bit jealous
im a little bit slow
im a little bit hurtful
and i dont wanna let it go
no and i dont wanna let it go
im a little bit angry when everyones around
but i get a little lonely when no ones out
i feel my demons misleading me

chours
im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go
im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go

maybe when i get older
and im in the ground
the weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down down

theres no space
as life breaks new ground

im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go
im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go

it doesnt matter what is out there
my head is spinning and it wont bail out
it doesnt matter what is out there
cause time fades
theres no space
as life breaks new ground

im just a believer that things will get better
some can take it or leave it but i dont wanna let it go
