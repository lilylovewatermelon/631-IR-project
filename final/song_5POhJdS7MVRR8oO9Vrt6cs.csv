maybe i hang around here
a little more than i should
we both know i got somewhere else to go
but i got something to tell you
that i never thought i would
but i believe you really ought to know

chorus
i love you
i honestly love you

verse 2
you dont have to answer
i see it in your eyes
maybe it was better left unsaid
this is pure and simple
and you must realise
that its coming from my heart and not my head

chorus
i love you
i honestly love you

bridge
im not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
im not trying to make you anything at all
but this feeling doesnt come along everyday
and you shouldnt blow the chance
when youve got the chance to say
you might also likechorus
i love you
i love you
i honestly love you

verse 3
if we both were born
in another place and time
this moment might be ending in a kiss
but there you are with yours
and here i am with mine
so i guess well just be leaving it at this

chorus
i love you
i honestly love you
i honestly love youembed"
