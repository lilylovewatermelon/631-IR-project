well i got caught in panama city
tryin to buy some beer for some georgia girls
and i got wore out by my daddy
for stealin cigarettes from the smokes and more
and all my friends would get away
seems id get caught plain as day
i took the blame for every little thing

chorus
but i got away with you
and somehow l still aint been found out
its a crazy truth
like l strolled out the gates of alcatraz
and l walked in the louvre
now the mona lisas hanging in my house
i bust out of buckingham with the crown jewels
and l got away with you

verse 2
well lookin like you do
on its damn own should be a crime
let alone a fool like me
hand in hand with you should be doin time
but here we are runnin free
guess someone turned the other cheek
cause there aint no blue lights in the rear view
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
guess i got away with you
and somehow l still aint been found out
its a crazy truth
like l strolled out the gates of alcatraz
and l walked in the louvre
now the mona lisas hanging in my house
i bust out of buckingham with the crown jewels
and l got away with you

bridge
ill take it all the fails the falls
the county jails and one phone calls
id do it all again if i had to

chorus
cause i got away with you
somehow girl i still aint been found out
its a crazy truth
like l strolled out the gates of alcatraz
and l walked in the louvre
now the mona lisas hanging in my house
i bust out of buckingham with the crown jewels
and l got away with you
when l got away with you
yeah i got away with you1embed"
