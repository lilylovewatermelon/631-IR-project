i was a drab little crab once
now i know i can be happy as a clam
because im beautiful baby
oh did your daddy say to listen to your heart
be who you are on the inside
i need three words to tear his argument apart
your daddy lied

id rather be shiny
like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
scrub the deck and make it look shiny
i will sparkle like a wealthy womans neck
just a sec dont you know
fish are dumb dumb dumb
they chase anything that glitters beginners
here they come come come
to the brightest thing that glitters
my dinners

youre far too hasty hasty
you look tasty tasty

wow little mauis having trouble with his look
you little semidemiminigod
ouch what a terrible performance
get the hook get it
you dont swing it like you used to man
you might also likeyet i have to give you credit for my start
and your tattoos on the outside
for just like you i made myself a work of art
ill never hide i cant

im too shiny
im the sunrise on the surface of the sea
look at me you see im so shiny
the monsters see my weaponry and flee
cest la vie dont you know
i will shine shine shine
like a rainbow after showers
your powers will be mine mine mine
theyll be mourning you for hours
bring flowers

call me selfish selfish
call me shellfish shellfish

far from the gods who abandoned you
chasing the love of these humans
who made you feel wanted
its never enough
love yourself get your armor up
they can see your heart is a vacancy
so why not be shiny
watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
strut my stuff my stuff is so shiny
send your armies but theyll never be enough
my shells too tough maui man

you could try try try
but i hate negotiations prostrations
you will die die die
never test a big crustaceans impatience

unless you have something shiny
unless you have something shiny1embed"
