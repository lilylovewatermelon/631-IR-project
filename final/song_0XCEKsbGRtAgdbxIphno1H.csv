love i am love
i am all i am small
i can feel this is real
this is all i know this is all
i am old and i am well off
and i dont know myself
this is all i can sing
but i cant read you
yeah i dont want to know you
not at all
leave me be
yeah let me see you
for what you really are
not a ghost
of some beauty
that i cant deal with
not for a little while
or at allyou might also like2embed"
