some people say such awful things
dont understandttheyre so hateful
we dont need those diamond rings
even though they look tasteful
chichi parties
so important
sink a fortune
highclass apartment
one or two oohoohs
make you feel so good
its not a threat to nobody
in fact the people they should

dont you give me them blues
i got magic in my dancing shoes
let me hear you say ooooh ooooh ooooooh
dont you give me them blues
i got magic in my dancing shoes
let me hear you say ooooh ooooh ooooooh

verse 2
when you talk sweet things in my ear
i get so hot inside im burning my clothes
measure distances with tears
the tracksll run for miles when i feel those
mixed emotions
in your heart
guilty feelings
you fall apart
one or two oohoohs
nothing left to lose
im not a threat to nobody
dont try to give me them blues
