there’s a couple people that i owe a beer or two
and three or four i owe more than a few
for all the times i couldn’t find the answers
stumbling through the dark without a clue
this one’s for you

verse 2
mom and daddy always did their best
for a crazy fool who couldn’t help himself
i thank god they were there to see me through
this one’s for you

chorus
i told you all i’d write you a song song song song
pour my heart in the melody
to keep you singing along singing along singing along
this might not be the right time
these might not be the right lines to prove
for sayin what i’m tryin to
but this one’s for you

verse 3
i’ve been knocked down time and time again
got picked back up by love and few good friends
who reminded me of all i stood to lose
this one’s for you

made more than my fair share of the same mistakes
bridges burned and lessons learned
a few things that i can’t change
some apologies are way past overdue
so this one’s for you

chorus

pour my heart in the melody
to keep you singing along singing along singing along
this might not be the right time time time
and these might not be the right lines to prove to prove
for saying what i’m trying to
this one’s for you
