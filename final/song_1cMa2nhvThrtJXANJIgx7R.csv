the flowers are faded now
along with your letters
they will never see the light of day
cause ill never take them out
and theres no turning back
its for the better
baby i deserve more than empty words and promises
i believed everything you said
and i gave you the best i had
oh

chorus
so take a bow
cause youve taken everything else
you played the part
and like a star you played it so well
take a bow
cause this scene is coming to an end
i gave you love
all you give me was pretend
so now
take a bow

verse 2
the futures about to change
before you know it the curtain closes
take a look around
theres no one in the crowd
im throwing away the pain
and you should know that your performance it made me stronger now

so take a bow
cause youve taken everything else
you played the part
and like a star you played it so well
take a bow
cause this scene is coming to an end
i gave you love
all you give me was pretend
so now
take a bow

bridge
well it must of been slight of hand
cause i still cant understand
how i could never see
just what a fool believed
but the lies they start to show
tell me how it feels to know right now that i wont be around
so baby before i put you out

chorus
take a bow
cause youve taken everything else youve taken everything else
you played the part
and like a star you played it so well so well
take a bow
cause the scene is coming to an end
i gave you love
all you give me was pretend
so now
take a bow
cause youve taken everything else
you played the part i gave you all my love
and like a star you played it so well i gave you all my love
take a bow
cause the scene is coming to an end
i gave you love
all you give me was pretend
so now
take a bow
