well you took me to the movies you took me to the dance
you took me to your warehouse tied up in the back of your van
you said whip it out and i started to shout
im in love with a woman again
well you took me to your office we went to meet your folks
we went out to the garden shed where you took off all my clothes
and i was terrified by the look in your eyes
but theres a lot to loving i dont know
well you took me to the ceremony to sweat out all my fear
came across a cosmic serpent with hands woven into his hair
if hes my spirit guide im gonna stay inside
im never sleeping in a teepee again

refrain
no no no no no no no
scatting

verse 2
well you asked me where i came from in the middle of round ten
i thanked you for the compliment before you clarified what you meant
you said what the hell are you doing here
theres a prowler in my apartment
trout fishing in america made me go and buy a pole
but by the time i got around to reading the book
i was a celebrated deep sea pro
was drinking greyhounds way below the ground
on my very own tv show
well we went to get some work done so our faces finally matched
the doctor took one look at me and took a skin graft out of my ass
if this is what it takes to take you on a date
im gonna put my member behind glass
if i make it out alive of hollywood and vine
ill build a cabin up in the northwest

no no no no no no no
