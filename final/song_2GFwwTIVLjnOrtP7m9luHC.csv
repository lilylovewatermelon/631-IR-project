tell me i was never good enough
remind me of the demons that ive been running from
tell me who the hell you thought i was
or just blame it on the person the person ive become

prechorus
lately i dont give a fuck
cause i cant be myself when im with anyone
maybe im already gone
ill never be the same

chorus
it hit me like a hurricane
it hit me like a tidal wave
and i dont know why i drown my mind in everything they say
it hit me like a hurricane
it hit me like a tidal wave
and i dont know why i drown my mind it got the best of me

verse 2
tell me that im lost inside my mind
i reach out but its pulling me under
remind me ive been searching for something i wont find
tell me i was never worth the time
i reach out but its pulling me under
or just blame it on the person you think i left behind
