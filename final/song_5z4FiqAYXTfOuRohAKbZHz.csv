baby light up the room
ill be outside with flowers and booze
i was up late night dancing with you
we were up late right under the moon
baby crack out the balloons
almost high tide so take off your shoes
i was up late night enjoying the view
we were up late right under the moon

verse 2
baby light up the room
ill be outside with flowers and booze
i was up late night dancing with you
we were up late right under the moon
baby crack out the balloons
almost high tide so take off your shoes
i was up late night enjoying the view
we were up late right under the moon

verse 3
baby light up the room
ill be outside with flowers and booze
i was up late night dancing with you
we were up late right under the moon
baby crack out the balloons
almost high tide so take off your shoes
