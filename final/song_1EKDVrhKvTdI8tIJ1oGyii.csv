she said come over theres nobody home
i went over there was nobody home
but her light was on
her light was on
and im not as drunk as i seem
but still i stood out there in the street
throwing stones at her window
like i saw somebody do on tv

chorus 1
7 days til sunday
7 days til sunday
7 days til sunday
7 days til sunday
until sunday
until sunday
until

verse 2
she said come over theres nobody home
she said i know thats what i told you before
but here in new york you dont need excuses to dress like a girl
sex drugs and deceit
i guess shes not as frail as she seems
i pushed as hard as i could
but she said thats okay because thats the way that i like it

verse 3
she said come over cause everyones here
and im glad she had to make that clear
smoking cigs on her roof
laughing at the people on the train cause theyre not like us
but i lost the drugs and i stayed too long
i got drunk and made fun of her band
but thank god it was sunday and theres more than just one way
to ruin a onenight stand

chorus 3
7 days til sunday
7 days til sunday
7 days til sunday
ooh 7 days til sunday
until sunday
until sunday
