treehouse bb gun and band aid covered knees
he does good deliverin papers
an cuttin grass for the neighbours
except for widow wilson he cuts hers for free
his little hands do a lot for a kid his age
he puts onetenth of his hard earned money
in the offering plate each sunday by his own choice
theres a lotta man in that little boy

weekdays he tries to sleep late
weekends hes up at daybreak
him an roy wadin in cotton creek
that dog was like his brother
youd seen one youd see the other
cut one an both of them would bleed
tires screamed but that ol truck couldnt stop
theres the tree that he buried him under
he made a cross from scraps of lumber
an on it carved god bless ol roy
theres a lotta man in that little boy

theres a house down where he goes fishin
he told his mom those kids got nothin
and i dont need all these toys
theres a lotta man
theres a lotta man theres a lotta man
