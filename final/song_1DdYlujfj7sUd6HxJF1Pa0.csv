aint no hat 4 that

verse 1
some say that your behavior is preposterous
you’re just an imaginary friend
dangerous to my pursuit of happiness
trouble’s bound to get me in the end

hook
you got your cure for anxious
you got your pill for bad
but your fancy shoes and handbag
can’t help you when you’re sad
cause there ain’t no hat for that
ain’t no hat for that
there ain’t no hat for that
ain’t no hat for that

verse 2
some say her temperament’s obstreperous
she’s only nice when something is at stake
and speaking for her friends there is a cost to us
we pay the price for riding in that wake

hook

shopping for your superficial treasures
stopping short of offering your heart
stranger to the simplest of pleasures
distance is to you a work of art

hook x3

outro
ain’t no hat for that
ain’t no hat for that
there ain’t no hat for that
ain’t no hat for that7embed"
