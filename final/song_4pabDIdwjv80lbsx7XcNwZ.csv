too young to see tomorrow
too young to know it hurts
found love in empty bottles
i guess well never learn
so just lay with me lay with me late til morning
cause im high and youre high together were soarin

verse 1
and if i go too hard pray the lord my soul to take
ive been up all night tell tomorrow it can wait
i think we went too far the ones they couldnt say
inside you i found faith

prechorus
i apologize if i say
anything i do mean
cause ive been drinking too much
faded off the gasoline
im just trying to live life
put on for my family
thats on everything
girl we can do anything
cause baby we are

chorus
