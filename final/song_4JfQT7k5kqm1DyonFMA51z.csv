sometimes i get to feelin i was back in the old days long ago
when we were kids when we were young
things seemed so perfect you know
the days were endless we were crazy we were young
the sun was always shinin we just lived for fun
sometimes it seems like lately i just dont know
the rest of my lifes been just a show

chorus
those were the days of our lives
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one thing is true
when i look and i find i still love you
verse 2
you cant turn back the clock you cant turn back the tide
aint that a shame
ooh id like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
when life was just a game
no use in sittin and thinkin on what you did
when you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
sometimes it seems like lately i just dont know
better sit back and go with the flow

chorus
cause these are the days of our lives
theyve flown in the swiftness of time
these days are all gone now but some things remain
when i look and i find no change

chorus
those were the days of our lives yeah
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one things still true
when i look and i find i still love you
