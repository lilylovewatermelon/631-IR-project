youre wound up like a weapon
you got an evil streak
they told me to stay away
but i was much too weak

stop stop cant you hear me call and singin
stop stop it girl
yeah you gotta
stop stop cant you see me fall and singin
stop stop it girl

verse 2
i hounded you forever
but you never saw
this love was so strong it shoulda
been against the law

chorus
yeah you gotta
stop stop cant you hear me call and singin
stop stop it girl
yeah you gotta
stop stop cant you see me fall and singin
stop stop it girl

like being cooled by the rain
in the eye of the storm

stop stop cant you see me fall and singin
stop stop it girl
