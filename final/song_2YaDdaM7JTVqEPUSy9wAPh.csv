had me low had me down
i viewed the morning with such alarm
british museum had lost its charm
how long i wondered could this thing last
but the age of miracles hadnt passed
for suddenly i saw you there
and through foggy london town
the sun was shining everywhere

a foggy day in london town
had me low and had me down
i viewed the morning with alarm
the british museum had lost its charm
how long i wondered could this thing last
but the age of miracles hadnt passed
for suddenly i saw you there
and through foggy london town
the sun was shining everywhereyou might also likeembed"
