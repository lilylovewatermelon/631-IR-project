are we so alone
so distant
so forgotten
as we think ourselves to be
these are our lives
but did they ever even matter
are we worth remembering

prechorus
these machines feed on the tears
of broken lives and dying dreams
were throwing wrenches in the gears
our lives will not be lived in vain

chorus
when this is all said and done
we spent this life on the run
judged by the company we keep
our language buried inside
these lungs that keep us alive
we breathe so selfishly

verse 2
promises we plan to break
are made in whispered voices
cause our despair knows many names
we make mistakes
but we apologize with roses
we never stop to smell along the way

these machines feed on the tears
of broken lives and dying dreams
were throwing wrenches in the gears
our lives will not be lived in vain

chorus
when this is all said and done
we spent this life on the run
judged by the company we keep
our language buried inside
these lungs that keep us alive
we breathe so selfishly

bridge
we fell from the sky today
we melt into balls of clay
we sell ourselves everyday
dont tell me how to live this way

verse 3
pushed so far to the edge
we teeter just on the brink
you can lead me to the bloodbath
but you cant make me drink
as these machines feed on the tears
of broken lives and dying dreams
were throwing wrenches in the gears
our lives will not be lived in vain
my life will not be lived in vain1embed"
