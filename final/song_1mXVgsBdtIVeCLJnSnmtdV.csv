you must think that im stupid
you must think that im a fool
you must think that im new to this
but i have seen this all before

prechorus
im never gonna let you close to me
even though you mean the most to me
cause every time i open up it hurts
so im never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

chorus
but every time you hurt me the less that i cry
and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less i love you
baby we dont stand a chance its sad but its true
im way too good at goodbyes
im way too good at goodbyes
im way too good at goodbyes
im way too good at goodbyes

verse 2
i know youre thinkin im heartless
i know youre thinkin im cold
im just protectin my innocence
im just protectin my soul
