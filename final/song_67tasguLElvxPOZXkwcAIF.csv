every time i look in your eyes
its like you take me back to the islands
you got me mile high cause youre my little pilot
im smiling no sand in the hour glass
we can let the hours pass baby cause youre timeless
its easy living right beside you
we got it whatever we go through baby

chorus 1 florida georgia line
life is a honeymoon were gonna live it
let love keep us lifting my dear
turn up a summer tune were gonna kick it
get it sounding like hendrix in here
serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
not missing a moment were giving
cause life is a honeymoon were gonna live it
let love keep us lifting my dear

verse 2 florida georgia line
see its a monday through friday 365 celebration
a every daycation
let my kiss be an open invitation
see where it can take us and get our hearts racing
i love flying way up there with you

the wood in on my fire youre my fire thats never gone
who feels it knows fgl how it goes
