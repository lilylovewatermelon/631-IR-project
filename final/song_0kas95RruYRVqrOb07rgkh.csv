i wanna take my wig off
i wanna lay it on the nightstand
i wanna take my makeup off
i wanna rip these nails off my hands

prechorus
and i might look like who did what and why
up under all of this
but you came to spend the night
so you know that there was way more to me

and if you dont want me at my goodnight

verse 3
tell me why should i be trippin’ on you
while i could be payin dues
im a fountain of youth raised on arie and badu
i know im fine don’t need a outer confirmation from a man
who uses 2in1 and thinks hes a sensation
dont need acrylics on the clock to hit the nail on the head
dont need my inches down my back to throw it back in the bed
so when you speak on me and say that she aint put together
dont forget to mention that i got my shit together

chorus
if you dont want me at my goodnight if you dont want me
then you cant have me at my morning glory at my glory
at my morning glory
and if you dont want me at my goodnight you dont want me at my goodnight
