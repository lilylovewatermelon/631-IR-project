just a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down
sweet mary jane wont you lay me down
lost my heart in california lost my mind
shot me down with a revolver got me high

then a heart of gold came on the stereo
mr young made me cry
then all the colors of the rainbow
fell in my eyes

chorus
i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road
i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road

verse 2
took a train to the river where i dove right in
that skinny dipping girl made the blue bird sing
fell in love in california she blew my mind
she shot me down with her revolver she got me high

then the weather man came on the radio
said therell be sunshine
then all the colors of the rainbow
fell in my mind

i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road
i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road

chorus
i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road
i lost my mind long ago
down that yellow brick road8embed"
