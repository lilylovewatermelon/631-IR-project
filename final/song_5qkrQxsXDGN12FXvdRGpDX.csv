where some of us go
when the hard working day is through
through the neon smoke
we laugh and tell jokes
and throw down a cold one or two
theres a jukebox thats full of records
by willie haggard and jones
theres a picture of elvis and ol john wayne
hanging side by side on the wall

down at joes place
its still the old way
pickled eggs in a jar
and a blue ribbon sign
ol boys and bankers
sitting side by side
down at joes place
down at joes place

allong about midnight
a few hangers on
are still hanging out at the bar
if the telephone rings
its an understood thing
joe dont know where they are
at a table in the corner
theres a young man and an empty chair
his head in his hands tears in his eyes
and a girlfriends ring lying there
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likedown at joes place
its still the old way
pickled eggs in a jar
and a blue ribbon sign
ol boys and bankers
sitting side by side
down at joes place
down at joes placeembed"
