baby you just left and im already missin you
had a bad idea got a broken heart
seeing it all now shoulda done what i did not do
learnin to love you was tearing me apart

chorus
i gotta go i cant love you and leave you in the middle
darlin whyd you leave it up to me
been a long hard crawl through the bottom of the wall
but its a place i like to be
had no plans of being that man that you were beggin me to be any more
oh it aint that i dont love you i just love this all a little bit more

verse 2
baby since you left im as lonely as ive ever been
cause if its hard on you well its hell on me
i do my best to try to hide how i really feel
and how i am right now i hope you never see

chorus
cause i gotta go i cant love you and leave you in the middle
darlin whyd you leave it up to me
been a long hard crawl through the bottom of the wall
but its a place i like to be
had no plans of being that man that you were beggin me to be any more
oh it aint that i dont love you
just love this all a little bit more

well its been so long since you left and im still missin you
so i just sit alone and drink in the dark
i dont feel too bad for how it all went down
you stole my dog and i broke your heart

chorus
i gotta go i cant love you and leave you in the middle
darlin whyd you leave it up to me
been a long hard crawl through the bottom of the wall
but its a place i like to be
had no plans of being that man that you were beggin me to be any more
oh it aint that i dont love you
just love this all a little bit more

outro
oh it aint that i dont love you
just love this all a little bit more
just a little bit moreembed"
