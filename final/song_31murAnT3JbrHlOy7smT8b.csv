chorus lil durk
they left me bruised up they tried to leave me used up
i was confused cause the ones i love ain’t prove much
i did everything they lied say i aint do much
and they aint call me to plead they case and it’d been two months
posting guns on your page that put us all in danger
but they say im one of the leaders cause im the one thats famous
some niggas dont come around unless its entertainment
whеn its time to kill for real them niggas gon’ keep complaining

postchorus lil durk

verse 2 lil baby
they dont tell you about the other part taking showers with your boxers on
if you ever go to prison buy a knife before you buy a phone
got caught up in the system aint have life but he aint make it home
thats crazy got killed in the place that was posed to save him
im grateful that i got the paper to pay the lawyers brodie waiting
these niggas flawed and i see the hate in they faces
i bet theyll be all happier if we could stop and trade places but nah nigga
aint a competition with no one im tryna ball with you
i dont care if you richer whats the tab
i got half ima pay for me and brodienem
and a lot of yall rappers shouldve been on nickelodeon
acting ass niggas dont come close to him yeah
