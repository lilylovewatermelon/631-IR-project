what about your promises promises
what about your promises promises promises no

verse 1
what a shame
didnt wanna be the one that got away yeah
big mistake you broke the sweetest promise
that you never should have made

prechorus
im here on the kitchen floor
you call but i wont hear it
you said no one else
how could you do this babe

chorus
what about your promises promises
you really blew this babe
we aint getting through this one babe
this is the last time ill ever call you babe
this is the last time this is the last time
this is the last time ill ever call you babe
what about your promises promises promises no

verse 2
what a waste
takin down the pictures and the plans we made yeah
and its strange how your face doesnt look so innocent
your secret has its consequence and thats on you babe
