to question every single word you say
the distance that keeps growin
in between us girl just leaves me so afraid
well you tried so hard to carry on
but i can tell theres somethin wrong these days
well girl ive gotta know the truth
just give it to me straight dont look away

dont look away
dont look away
when i ask you if you love me still
and if youre gonna stay
dont look away

well ive known you long enough to know
your tryin not to let your feelins show
lately when i hold you near i still feel im sittin here alone
well i still feel im sittin here alone
this confusion settin in your mind
blockin all the words you mean to say
well girl ive gotta know the truth
just give it to me straight dont look away

dont look away
dont look away
when i ask you if you love me still
and if youre gonna stay
dont look away

and if youre gonna stay
