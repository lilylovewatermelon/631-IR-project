i remember vividly what that vision did to me
you layin with her in our bed
love can be a tragedy when you do what you did to me
all im seein now is red

chorus
i need to repent
a sin for a sin

verse 2
bible told me to forget
all those who trespass against
tread their feet on sacred ground
bad things come with consequence
what feels good hurts in the end
donâ€™t wanna think about that now

chorus
i need to repent
a sin for a sin

postchorus
fire and brimstone dirt and a headstone
bury them baby all of our sins
hear the thunder six feet under
hit your knees wont do it again
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebridge
guilty pleasure
ease the pain
whisky running through my veins
too late to save you now

chorus
i need to repent
a sin for a sin

postchorus
fire and brimstone dirt and a headstone
bury them baby all of our sins
hear the thunder six feet under
hit your knees wont do it again

outro
i remember vividly
what that vision did to me2embed"
