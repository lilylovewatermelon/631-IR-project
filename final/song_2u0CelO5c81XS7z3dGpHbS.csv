if i told you that i loved you
tell me what would you say
if i told you that i hated you
would you go away
now i need your help with everything that i do
i dont want to lie ive been relying on you

i need a pickmeup
ive been callin you friend
i might need to give it up

chorus
im sick and im tired too
i can admit i am not fireproof
i feel it burning me
i feel it burning you
i hope i dont murder me
i hope i dont burden you
if i do if i do

verse 2

you make me feel little how youre looking at me
and you can throw me shade all it does is just cool me off
