didnt you know i was waiting on you
waiting on a dream thatll never come true
didnt you know i was waiting on you
my face turned to stone when i heard the news
when you decide to break the rules
cause i just heard some real bad news

verse 2
peoplell talk like its old news
i played it off and act like i already knew
let me ask you how long have you known dude
you played it off and act like hes brand new
when you decide to break the rules
cause i just heard some real bad news

refrain
real bad news
real bad news
real bad news
