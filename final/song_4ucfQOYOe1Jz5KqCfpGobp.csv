this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when its late
sirens bleed through my windowsill
i cant close my eyes
dont control what im into
and this tower is alive
the lights that blind keep me awake
hood up and lace untied
sleep fills my mind
cant control what im into

prechorus
london calls me a stranger a traveller
this is now my home my home woo

chorus
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps then that makes two

verse 2
the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what im used to
and the shop across the road
fills my needs and gives me company when i need it
voices speak through my walls
i dont think im gonna make it
past tomorrow

chorus
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps then that makes two

bridge
and my lungs hurt and my ears bled
with the sound of the city life echoed in my head
do i need this to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts but i need to move along

prechorus
london calls me a stranger
this is not my home home

chorus
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
