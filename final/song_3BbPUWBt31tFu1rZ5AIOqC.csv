baby since you left me theres somebody new
she thinks im perfect i swear
she likes my body my class and my charm
she says ive got a confident air
she respects my ambition thinks im talented too
but shes in love with an image time is bound to see through

chorus
ohbut you know me better than that
you know the me that gets lazy and fat
how moody i can be all my insecurities
youve seen me lose all my charm you know i was raised on a farm
oh she tells her friends im perfect
and that i love her cat but you know me better than that

verse 2
i miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
now its ballet and symphony hall
im into culture clean up to my ears
its like wearing a shoe thats too small
oh i caught her with an issue of brides magazine
staring at dresses and picking out rings

chorus

oh she tells her friends im perfect and that i love that cat
oh but you know me better than thatembed"
