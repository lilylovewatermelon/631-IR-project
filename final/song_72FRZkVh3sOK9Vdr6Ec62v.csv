im not your man
were more than friends
we make love but i dont call you my lover
i do for you you do for me
it works because we dont smother each other
its short and sweet the time we spend
we cant take a second of it for granted no
i barely understand it
its not the way i planned it the way i planned it
why cant it just be what it is

pre chorus
whats in a name if we got what we need
aint nobody coming between us but we
everything i told you about my love i mean
i said everything that i said i mean

chorus
actions speak louder than words
baby im gonna treat you the way you deserve
we dont need we dont need definition
we dont need definition
what i feel is real and if you look that up
on top of the word you see picture of us
we dont need we dont need definition
we dont need definition

we shop we dine spend cuddle time
come over but only on invitation
not now in time were border line
i like you but dont quit your occupation
my heart my ace but just in case
lets stay open to other situations
why tell you we gonna be more
keep you on a leash for
i dont wanna string you along girl

pre chorus
whats in a name if we got what we need

even though we used to the titles and getting made
but maybe this time we should just leave this one alone
cause if this working for us then its working for us
dont go messing it up dont go messing it up
even though we used to the titles and getting made
but maybe this time we should just leave this one alone
cause if this working for us then its working for us
dont go messing it up dont go messing it up

chorus

baby im gonna treat you the way you deserve
we dont need we dont need definition
we dont need definition
what i feel is real and if you look that up
on top of the word you see picture of us
we dont need we dont need definition
we dont need definition
actions speak louder than words
baby im gonna treat you the way you deserve
we dont need we dont need definition
we dont need definition
what i feel is real and if you look that up
on top of the word you see picture of us
we dont need we dont need definition
