last night i got served a little bit too much of that poison baby
last night i did things im not proud of
and i got a little crazy
last night i met a guy on the dance floor
and i let him call me baby

chorus
and i dont even know his last name
oh my mama would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i dont even know his last name
woo

verse 2
we left the club right around three oclock in the morning
his pinto sittin there in the parking lot
when it shouldve been a warning
i had no clue what i was getting into
so ill blame it on the cuervo
oh where did my manners go

chorus
and i dont even know his last name
oh my mama would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i dont even know his last name
here we go

mmm today i woke up thinking about elvis somewhere in vegas
im not sure how i got here
or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
i gotta go
i take the chips and the pinto and hit the road
they say what happens here stays here all of this will disappear
theres just one little problem

chorus
i dont even know my last name
oh my mama would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i dont even know my last name

breakdown
