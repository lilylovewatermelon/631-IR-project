its been seven hours long
and your shadow still hangs on
youve been two weeks gone
and so tonight i followed you home

prechorus
there are so many different ways
of collecting all the strays
the ones that get away

chorus
old fascinations we crave new sensations
old fascination its feeding my frustrations
its feeding my frustrations
and i havent got the patience

verse 2
these sheets are still warm
this bed is our only home
we make arrangements over the phone
where has all the conversation gone

prechorus
there are so many different ways
of collecting all the strays
the ones that get away

its feeding my frustrations
and i havent got the patience
