know o king of the age that most marvellous was that which befell me but yesterday before i foregathered with the hunch back it so chanced that in the early day i was at the marriage feast of one of my companions who had gotten together in his house some twenty of the handicraftsmen of this city amongst them tailors and silk spinners and carpenters and others of the same kidney as soon as the sun had risen they set foodfn601 before us that we might eat when behold the master of the house entered and with him a foreign youth and a well favoured of the people of baghdad wearing clothes as handsome as handsome could be and he was of right comely presence save that he was lame of one leg he came and saluted us and we stood up to receive him but when he was about to sit down he espied amongst us a certain man which was a barber whereupon he refused to be seated and would have gone away but we stopped him and our host also stayed him making oath that he should not leave us and asked him what is the reason of thy coming in and going out again at once whereto he answered by allah o my lord do not hinder me for the cause of my turning back is yon barber of bad omenfn602 yon black oface yon neer do well when the housemaster heard these words he marvelled with extreme marvel and said how cometh this young man who haileth from baghdad to be so troubled and perplexed about this barber then we looked at the stranger and said explain the cause of thine anger against the barber o fair company quoth the youth there befell me a strange adventure with this barber in baghdad which is my native city he was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my lameness and i have sworn never to sit in the same place with him nor even tarry in any town where he happens to abide and i have bidden adieu to baghdad and travelled far from it and came to stay in this your city yet i have hardly passed one night before i meet him again but not another day shall go by ere i fare forth from here said we to him allah upon thee tell us the tale and the youth replied the barber changing colour from brown to yellow as he spoke know o fair company that my father was one of the chief merchants of baghdad and almighty allah had blessed him with no son but myself when i grew up and reached mans estate my father was received into the mercy of allah whose name be exalted and left me money and eunuchs servants and slaves and i used to dress well and diet well now allah had made me a hater of women kind and one day as i was walking along a street in baghdad a party of females met me face to face in the footway so i fled from them and entering an alley which was no thoroughfare sat down upon a stone bench at its other end i had not sat there long before the latticed window of one of the houses opposite was thrown open and there appeared at it a young lady as she were the full moon at its fullest never in my life saw i her like and she began to water some flowers on the window sillfn603 she turned right and left and seeing me watching her shut the window and went away thereupon fire was suddenly enkindled in my heart my mind was possessed with her and my woman hate turned to woman love i continued sitting there lost to the world till sunset when lo the kazi of the city came riding by with his slaves before him and his eunuchs behind him and dismounting entered the house in which the damsel had appeared by this i knew that he was her father so i went home sorrowful and cast myself upon my carpet bed in grief then my handmaids flocked in and sat about me unknowing what ailed me but i addressed no speech to them and they wept and wailed over me presently in came an old woman who looked at me and saw with a glance what was the matter with me so she by my head spoke me fair saying o my son tell me all about it and i will be the means of thy union with herfn604 so i related to her what had happened and she answered o my son this one is the daughter of the kazi of baghdad who keepeth her in the closest seclusion and the window where thou sawest her is her floor whilst her father occupies the large saloon in the lower story she is often there alone and i am wont to visit at the house so thou shalt not win to her save through me now set thy wits to work and be of good cheer with these words she went away and i took heart at what she said and my people rejoiced that day seeing me rise in the morning safe and sound by and by the old woman returned looking chopfallenfn605 and said o my son do not ask me how i fared with her when i told her that she cried at me if thou hold not thy peace o hag of ill omen and leave not such talk i will entreat thee as thou deservest and do thee die by the foulest of deaths but needs must i have at her a second timefn606 when i heard this it added ailment to my ailment and the neighbours visited me and judged that i was not long for this world but after some days the old woman came to me and putting her mouth close to my ear whispered o my son i claim from thee the gift of good news with this my soul returned to me and i said whatever thou wilt shall be thine thereupon she began yesterday i went to the young lady who seeing me broken in spirit and shedding tears from reddened eyes asked me o nauntyfn607 mine what ails thee that i see thy breast so straitened and i answered her weeping bitterly o my lady i am just come from the house of a youth who loves thee and who is about to die for sake of thee quoth she and her heart was softened and who is this youth of whom thou speakest and quoth i he is to me as a son and the fruit of my vitals he saw thee some days ago at the window watering thy flowers and espying thy face and wrists he fell in love at first sight i let him know what happened to me the last time i was with thee whereupon his ailment increased he took to the pillow and he is naught now but a dead man and no doubt what ever of it at this she turned pale and asked all this for my sake and i answered ay by allahfn608 what wouldst thou have me do said she go back to him and greet him for me and tell him that i am twice more heartsick than he is and on friday before the hour of public prayer bid him here to the house and i will come down and open the door for him then i will carry him up to my chamber and foregather with him for a while and let him depart before my father return from the mosque when i heard the old womans words all my sickness suddenly fell from me my anguish ceased and my heart was comforted i took off what clothes were on me and gave them to her and as she turned to go she said keep a good heart i have not a jot of sorrow left i replied my household and intimates rejoiced in my recovery and i abode thus till friday when behold the old woman came in and asked me how i did to which i answered that i was well and in good case then i donned my clothes and perfumed myself and sat down to await the congregation going in to prayers that i might betake myself to her but the old woman said to me thou hast time and to spare so thou wouldst do well to go to the hammam and have thy hair shaven off especially after thy ailment so as not to show traces of sickness this were the best way answered i i have just now bathed in hot water but i will have my head shaved then i said to my page go to the bazaar and bring me a barber a discreet fellow and one not inclined to meddling or impertinent curiosity or likely to split my head with his excessive talkfn609 the boy went out at once and brought back with him this wretched old man this shaykh of ill omen when he came in he saluted me and i returned his salutation then quoth he of a truth i see thee thin of body and quoth i i have been ailing he continued allah drive far away from thee thy woe and thy sorrow and thy trouble and thy distress allah grant thy prayer said i he pursued all gladness to thee o my master for indeed recovery is come to thee dost thou wish to be polled or to be blooded indeed it was a tradition of ibn abbasfn610 allah accept of him that the apostle said whoso cutteth his hair on a friday the lord shall avert from him threescore and ten calamities and again is related of him also that he said cupping on a friday keepeth from loss of sight and a host of diseases leave this talk i cried come shave me my head at once for i cant stand it so he rose and put forth his hand in most leisurely way and took out a kerchief and unfolded it and lo it contained an astrolabefn611 with seven parallel plates mounted in silver then he went to the middle of the court and raised head and instrument towards the suns rays and looked for a long while when this was over he came back and said to me know that there have elapsed of this our day which be friday and this friday be the tenth of the month safar in the six hundred and fifty third year since the hegira or flight of the apostle on whom be the bestest of blessings and peace and the seven thousand three hundred and twentieth year of the era of alexander eight degrees and six minutes furthermore the ascendant of this our day is according to the exactest science of computation the planet mars and it so happeneth that mercury is in conjunction with him denoting an auspicious moment for hair cutting and this also maketh manifest to me that thou desires union with a certain person and that your intercourse will not be propitious but after this there occurreth a sign respecting a matter which will befall thee and whereof i will not speak o thou cried i by allah thou weariest me and scatterest my wits and thy forecast is other than good i sent for thee to poll my head and naught else so up and shave me and prolong not thy speech by allah replied he if thou but knew what is about to befall thee thou wouldst do nothing this day and i counsel thee to act as i tell thee by computation of the constellations by allah said i never did i see a barber who excelled in judicial astrology save thyself but i think and i know that thou art most prodigal of frivolous talk i sent for thee only to shave my head but thou comest and pesterest me with this sorry prattle what more wouldst thou have replied he allah hath bounteously bestowed on thee a barber who is an astrologer one learned in alchemy and white magicfn612 syntax grammar and lexicology the arts of logic rhetoric and elocution mathematics arithmetic and algebra astronomy astromancy and geometry theology the traditions of the apostle and the commentaries on the koran furthermore i have read books galore and digested them and have had experience of affairs and comprehended them in short i have learned the theorick and the practick of all the arts and sciences i know everything of them by rote and i am a past master in tota re scibili thy father loved me for my lack of officiousness argal to serve thee is a religious duty incumbent on me i am no busy body as thou seemest to suppose and on this account i am known as the silent man also the modest man wherefore it behoveth thee to render thanks to allah almighty and not cross me for i am a true counsellor to thee and benevolently minded towards thee would that i were in thy service a whole year that thou mightest do me justice and i would ask thee no wage for all this when i heard his flow of words i said to him doubtless thou wilt be my death this day—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the thirtieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the young man said to the barber thou certainly will be the death of me this very day o master mine replied he i am he the silent man hight by reason of the fewness of my words to distinguish me from my six brothers for the eldest is called albakbúk the prattler the second alhaddár the babbler the third alfakík the gabbler the fourth his name is alkuz alaswáni the long necked gugglet from his eternal chattering the fifth is al nashshár the tattler and tale teller the sixth shakáshik or many clamours and the seventh is famous as alsámit the silent man and this is my noble self whilst he redoubled his talk i thought my gall bladder would have burst so i said to the servant give him a quarter dinar and dismiss him and let him go from me in the name of god who made him i wont have my head shaved to day what words be these o my lord cried he by allah i will accept no hire of thee till i have served thee and have ministered to thy wants and i care not if i never take money of thee if thou know not my quality i know thine and i owe thy father an honest man on whom allah almighty have mercy many a kindness for he was a liberal soul and a generous by allah he sent for me one day as it were this blessed day and i went in to him and found a party of his intimates about him quoth he to me let me blood so i pulled out my astrolabe and taking the suns altitude for him i ascertained that the ascendant was inauspicious and the hour unfavourable for brooding i told him of this and he did according to my bidding and awaited a better opportunity so i made these lines in honour of him—

i went to my patron some blood to let him  but found that the
       nbsp   moment was far from good
so i sat and i talked of all strangenesses  and with jests and
       nbsp   jokes his good will i wooed
they pleased him and cried he o man of wit  thou hast proved
       nbsp    thee perfect in merry mood
quoth i o thou lord of men save thou  lend me art and
       nbsp    wisdom im fou and wood
in thee gather grace boon bounty suavity  and i guerdon the
       nbsp   world with lore science and gravity

thy father was delighted and cried out to the servant give him an hundred and three gold pieces with a robe of honour the man obeyed his orders and i awaited an auspicious moment when i blooded him and he did not baulk me nay he thanked me and i was also thanked and praised by all present when the bloodletting was over i had no power to keep silence and asked him by allah o my lord what made thee say to the servant give him an hundred and three dinars and he answered one dinar was for the astrological observation another for thy pleasant conversation the third for the phlebotomisation and the remaining hundred and the dress were for thy verses in my commendation may allah show small mercy to my father exclaimed i for knowing the like of thee he laughed and ejaculated there is no god but the god and mohammed is the apostle of god glory to him that changeth and is changed not i took thee for a man of sense but i see thou babblest and dotest for illness allah hath said in the blessed bookfn613 paradise is prepared for the goodly who bridle their anger and forgive men and so forth and in any case thou art excused yet i cannot conceive the cause of thy hurry and flurry and thou must know that thy father and thy grandfather did nothing without consulting me and indeed it hath been said truly enough let the adviser be prized and there is no vice in advice and it is also said in certain saws whoso hath no counsellor elder than he will never himself an elder befn614 and the poet says—

whatever needful thing thou undertake  consult th experienced and contraire him not

and indeed thou shalt never find a man better versed in affairs than i and i am here standing on my feet to serve thee i am not vexed with thee why shouldest thou be vexed with me but whatever happen i will bear patiently with thee in memory of the much kindness thy father shewed me by allah cried i o thou with tongue long as the tail of a jackass thou persistest in pestering me with thy prate and thou becomest more longsome in thy long speeches when all i want of thee is to shave my head and wend thy way then he lathered my head saying i perceive thou art vexed with me but i will not take it ill of thee for thy wit is weak and thou art but a laddy it was only yesterday i used to take thee on my shoulderfn615 and carry thee to school o my brother said i for allahs sake do what i want and go thy gait and i rent my garmentsfn616 when he saw me do this he took the razor and fell to sharpening it and gave not over stropping it until my senses were well nigh leaving me then he came up to me and shaved part of my head then he held his hand and then he said o my lord haste is satans gait whilst patience is of allah the compassionate but thou o my master i ken thou knowest not my rank for verily this hand alighteth upon the heads of kings and emirs and wazirs and sages and doctors learned in the law and the poet said of one like me—

all crafts are like necklaces strung on a string  but this
       nbsp    barbers the union pear of the band
high over all craftsmen he ranketh and why  the heads of the
       nbsp   kings are under his handfn617
then said i do leave off talking about what concerneth thee not indeed thou hast straitened my breast and distracted my mind quoth he meseems thou art a hasty man and quoth i yes  yes yes and he i rede thee practice restraint of self for haste is satans pelf which bequeatheth only repentance and ban and bane and he upon whom be blessings and peace hath said the best of works is that wherein deliberation lurks but i by allah have some doubt about thine affair and so i should like thee to let me know what it is thou art in such haste to do for i fear me it is other than good then he continued it wanteth three hours yet to prayer time but i do not wish to be in doubt upon this matter nay i must know the moment exactly for truly a guess shot in times of doubt oft brings harm about especially in the like of me a superior person whose merits are famous amongst mankind at large and it doth not befit me to talk at random as do the common sort of astrologers so saying he threw down the razor and taking up the astrolabe went forth under the sun and stood there a long time after which he returned and counting on his fingers said to me there remain still to prayer time three full hours and complete neither more nor yet less according to the most learned astronomicals and the wisest makers of almanacks allah upon thee cried i hold thy tongue with me for thou breakest my liver in pieces so he took the razor and after sharpening it as before and shaving other two hairs of my head he again held his hand and said i am concerned about thy hastiness and indeed thou wouldst do well to let me into the cause of it t were the better for thee as thou knowest that neither thy father nor thy grandfather ever did a single thing save by my advice when i saw that there was no escape from him i said to myself the time for prayer draws near and i wish to go to her before the folk come out of the mosque if i am delayed much longer i know not how to come at her then said i aloud be quick and stint this talk and impertinence for i have to go to a party at the house of some of my intimates when he heard me speak of the party he said this thy day is a blessed day for me in very sooth it was but yesterday i invited a company of my friends and i have forgotten to provide anything for them to eat this very moment i was thinking of it alas how i shall be disgraced in their eyes be not distressed about this matter answered i have i not told thee that i am bidden to an entertainment this day so every thing in my house eatable and drinkable shall be thine if thou wilt only get through thy work and make haste to shave my head he replied allah requite thee with good specify to me what is in thy house for my guests that i may be ware of it quoth i five dishes of meat and ten chickens with reddened breastsfn618 and a roasted lamb set them before me quoth he that i may see them so i told my people to buy borrow or steal them and bring them in anywise and had all this set before him when he saw it he cried the wine is wanting and i replied i have a flagon or two of good old grape juice in the house and he said have it brought out so i sent for it and he exclaimed allah bless thee for a generous disposition but there are still the essences and perfumes so i bade them set before him a box containing naddfn619 the best of compound perfumes together with fine lignaloes ambergris and musk unmixed the whole worth fifty dinars now the time waxed strait and my heart straitened with it so i said to him take it all and finish shaving my head by the life of mohammed whom allah bless and keep by allah said he i will not take it till i see all that is in it so i bade the page open the box and the barber laid down the astrolabe leaving the greater part of my head unpolled and sitting on the ground turned over the scents and incense and aloes wood and essences till i was well nigh distraught then he took the razor and coming up to me shaved off some few hairs and repeated these lines—

the boy like his father shall surely show  as the tree from its parent root shall growfn620

then said he by allah o my son i know not whether to thank thee or thy father for my entertainment this day is all due to thy bounty and beneficence and although none of my company be worthy of it yet i have a set of honourable men to wit zantut the bathkeeper and salia the cornchandler and silat the bean seller and akrashah the greengrocer and humayd the scavenger and said the camelman and suwayd the porter and abu makarish the bathmanfn621 and kasim the watchman and karim the groom there is not among the whole of them a bore or a bully in his cups nor a meddler nor a miser of his money and each and every hath some dance which he danceth and some of his own couplets which he caroleth and the best of them is that like thy servant thy slave here they know not what much talking is nor what forwardness means the bath keeper sings to the tom tomfn622 a song which enchants and he stands up and dances and chants

i am going o mammy to fill up my pot

as for the cornchandler he brings more skill to it than any he dances and sings

o keenerfn623 0 sweetheart thou fallest not short

and he leaves no ones vitals sound for laughing at him but the scavenger sings so that the birds stop to listen to him and dances and sings

news my wife wots is not locked in a boxfn624

and he hath privilege for tis a shrewd roguefn625 and a witty and speaking of his excellence i am wont to say

my life for the scavenger right well i love him  like a waving
       nbsp  bough he is sweet to my sight
fate joined us one night when to him quoth i  the while i grew
       nbsp  weak and love gained more might
thy love burns my heart and no wonder quoth he  when the
       nbsp    drawer of dung turns a stoker wightfn626

and indeed each is perfect in whatso can charm the wit with joy and jollity adding presently but hearing is not seeing and indeed if thou make up thy mind to join us and put off going to thy friends twill be better for us and for thee the traces of illness are yet upon thee and haply thou art going among folk who be mighty talkers men who commune together of what concerneth them not or there may be amongst them some forward fellow who will split thy head and thou half thy size from sickness this shall be for some other day answered i and laughed with heart angered finish thy work and go in allah almightys guard to thy friends for they will be expecting thy coming o my lord replied he i seek only to introduce thee to these fellows of infinite mirth the sons of men of worth amongst whom there is neither procacity nor dicacity nor loquacity for never since i grew to years of discretion could i endure to consort with one who asketh questions concerning what concerneth him not nor have i ever frequented any save those who are like myself men of few words in sooth if thou were to company with them or even to see them once thou wouldst forsake all thy intimates allah fulfil thy joyance with them said i needs must i come amongst them some day or other but he said would it were this very day for i had set my heart upon thy making one of us yet if thou must go to thy friends to day i will take these good things wherewith thou hast honoured and favoured me to my guests and leave them to eat and drink and not wait for me whilst i will return to thee in haste and accompany thee to thy little party for there is no ceremony between me and my intimates to prevent my leaving them fear not i will soon be back with thee and wend with thee whithersoever thou wendest there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great i shouted go thou to thy friends and make merry with them and do let me go to mine and be with them this day for they expect me but the barber cried i will not let thee go alone and i replied the truth is none can enter where i am going save myself he rejoined i suspect that to day thou art for an assignation with some woman else thou hadst taken me with thee yet am i the right man to take one who could aid thee to the end thou wishest but i fear me thou art running after strange women and thou wilt lose thy life for in this our city of baghdad one cannot do any thing in this line especially on a day like friday our governor is an angry man and a mighty sharp blade shame on thee thou wicked bad old man cried i be off what words are these thou givest me o cold of witfn627 cried he thou sayest to me what is not true and thou hidest thy mind from me but i know the whole business for certain and i seek only to help thee this day with my best endeavour i was fearful lest my people or my neighbours should hear the barbers talk so i kept silence for a long time whilst he finished shaving my head by which time the hour of prayer was come and the khutbah or sermon was about to follow when he had done i said to him go to thy friends with their meat and drink and i will await thy return then we will fare together in this way i hoped to pour oil on troubled waters and to trick the accursed loon so haply i might get quit of him but he said thou art cozening me and thou wouldst go alone to thy appointment and cast thyself into jeopardy whence there will be no escape for thee now by allah and again by allah do not go till i return that i may accompany thee and watch the issue of thine affair so be it i replied do not be long absent then he took all the meat and drink i had given him and the rest of it and went out of my house but the accursed carle gave it in charge of a porter to carry to his home but hid himself in one of the alleys as for me i rose on the instant for the muezzins had already called the salam of friday the salute to the apostlefn628 and i dressed in haste and went out alone and hurrying to the street took my stand by the house wherein i had seen the young lady i found the old woman on guard at the door awaiting me and went up with her to the upper story the damsels apartment hardly had i reached it when behold the master of the house returned from prayers and entering the great saloon closed the door i looked down from the window and saw this barber allahs curse upon him sitting over against the door and said how did this devil find me out at this very moment as allah had decreed it for rending my veil of secrecy it so happened that a handmaid of the house master committed some offence for which he beat her she shrieked out and his slave ran in to intercede for her whereupon the kazi beat him to boot and he also roared out the damned barber fancied that it was i who was being beaten so he also fell to shouting and tore his garments and scattered dust on his head and kept on shrieking and crying help  help  so the people came round about him and he went on yelling my master is being murdered in the kazis house then he ran clamouring to my place with the folk after him and told my people and servants and slaves and before i knew what was doing up they came tearing their clothes and letting loose their hairfn629 and shouting alas our master and this barber leading the rout with his clothes rent and in sorriest plight and he also shouting like a madman and saying alas for our murdered master and they all made an assault upon the house in which i was the kazi hearing the yells and the uproar at his door said to one of his servants see what is the matter and the man went forth and returned and said o my master at the gate there are more than ten thousand souls what with men and women and all crying out alas for our murdered master and they keep pointing to our house when the kazi heard this the matter seemed serious and he waxed wroth so he rose and opening the door saw a great crowd of people whereat he was astounded and said o folk what is there to do o accursed o dog o hog my servants replied tis thou who hast killed our master quoth he o good folk and what hath your master done to me that i should kill him— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
when it was the thirtyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the kazi said to the servants what hath your master done to me that i should kill him this is my house and it is open to you all then quoth the barber thou didst beat him and i heard him cry out and quoth the kazi but what was he doing that i should beat him and what brought him in to my house and whence came he and whither went he be not a wicked perverse old man cried the barber for i know the whole story and the long and short of it is that thy daughter is in love with him and he loves her and when thou knewest that he had entered the house thou badest thy servants beat him and they did so by allah none shall judge between us and thee but the caliph or else do thou bring out our master that his folk may take him before they go in and save him perforce from thy house and thou be put to shame then said the kazi and his tongue was bridled and his mouth was stopped by confusion before the people an thou say sooth do thou come in and fetch him out whereupon the barber pushed forward and entered the house when i saw this i looked about for a means of escape and flight but saw no hiding place except a great chest in the upper chamber where i was so i got into it and pulled the lid down upon myself and held my breath the barber was hardly in the room before he began to look about for me then turned him right and left and came straight to the place where i was and stepped up to the chest and lifting it on his head made off as fast as he could at this my reason forsook me for i knew that he would not let me be so i took courage and opening the chest threw myself to the ground my leg was broken in the fall and the door being open i saw a great concourse of people looking in now i carried in my sleeve much gold and some silver which i had provided for an ill day like this and the like of such occasion so i kept scattering it amongst the folk to divert their attention from me and whilst they were busy scrambling for it i set off hopping as fast as i could through the by streets of baghdad shifting and turning right and left but whithersoever i went this damned barber would go in after me crying aloud they would have bereft me of my master they would have slain him who was a benefactor to me and my family and my friends praised be allah who made me prevail against them and delivered my lord from their hands then to me where wilt thou go now thou wouldst persist in following thine own evil devices till thou broughtest thyself to this ill pass and had not allah vouchsafed me to thee neer hadst thou escaped this strait into which thou hast fallen for they would have cast thee into a calamity whence thou never couldest have won free but i will not call thee to account for thine ignorance as thou art so little of wit and inconsequential and addicted to hastiness said i to him doth not what thou hast brought upon me suffice thee but thou must run after me and talk me such talk in the bazaar streets and i well nigh gave up the ghost for excess of rage against him then i took refuge in the shop of a weaver amiddlemost of the market and sought protection of the owner who drove the barber away and sitting in the back roomfn630 i said to myself if i return home i shall never be able to get rid of this curse of a barber who will be with me night and day and i cannot endure the sight of him even for a breathing space so i sent out at once for witnesses and made a will dividing the greater part of my property among my people and appointed a guardian over them to whom i committed the charge of great and small directing him to sell my houses and domains then i set out on my travels that i might be free of this pimpfn631 and i came to settle in your town where i have lived some time when you invited me and i came hither the first thing i saw was this accursed pander seated in the place of honour how then can my heart be glad and my stay be pleasant in company with this fellow who brought all this upon me and who was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my exile from home and native land and the youth refused to sit down and went away when we heard his story continued the tailor we were amazed beyond measure and amused and said to the barber by allah is it true what this young man saith of thee by allah replied he i dealt thus by him of my courtesy and sound sense and generosity had it not been for me he had perished and none but i was the cause of his escape well it was for him that he suffered in his leg and not in his life had i been a man of many words a meddler a busy body i had not acted thus kindly by him but now i will tell you a tale which befell me that you may be well assured i am a man sparing of speech in whom is no forwardness and a very different person from those six brothers of mine and this it is
