produced by 9th wonder

hook
my faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
until it’s paid for
strawberry season my sweetheart is coming ‘round
i hear it rain and pour
how did you find me here it must be perfect timing
forever grateful
if i didn’t love you then i damn sure love you now
fruit of your labor

verse
say ain’t shit change but the bank statements
spent the summer in the wave with the beach babies
threw your chula in the buggie
with the top down up the pch
i’m heading north i hope it doesnt rain
went from playing community ball to balling with the majors
oh what you major
yeah nigga i ran bases pitch flame
i call plays remove labels
and fuck fame that killed all my favorite entertainers
nothing short of amazing ooh yeah
but i’m short on my patience
say i don’t play that shit i don’t ever forget
and don’t forget that dot nigga you paid for it
i spent years being called out my name
living under my greatness
but what don’t kill me is motivation

my faith is buried somewhere underneath the town

i hear it rain and pour
how did you find me here it must be perfect timing
forever grateful
if i didn’t love you then i damn sure love you now
fruit of your labor

intro
yeah say yeah

hook
six years old i tried my first pair of jordans on
momma can you carry me
it was late in the fall
i caught a glimpse of my first love my god
momma can you carry me
knees hit the floor screams to the lord
why they had to take my ma momma carry me
to the early morn momma can you carry me
to the early morning momma can you carry me
verse 1
hey hey hey gather round hustlers thats if ya still livin
and get on down before the judge give the sentence
a few more rounds before the feds come and get you
is you gon smile when your date gets issued
you know them feds taking pictures
your mom’s in prison your father need a new kidney
your family’s splitting rivalries between siblings
if cash ain’t king its damn sure the incentive
and good riddance

interlude
is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group
yes you might say that why don’t you give it a try and find out for yourself

verse 2
bout the year drizzy and cole dropped
before kdot had it locked
i was sleeping on the floor newborn baby boy
tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn’t get deported
cursing the heavens falling out of orbit
tryna roll this seven tryna up my portion
what about your goals what about your leverage
so they don’t force you into some hole
what’s the meaning of my fortune reading
when i crack the cookie all it said was “keep dreaming”
when i look at my tree i see leaves missing
generations of harsh living and addiction
i came to visit during the sevenyear stint
but they wouldn’t let me in because my license suspended
now i’m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
it’s gonna be a couple weeks before i get it
i know you miss me
hook
