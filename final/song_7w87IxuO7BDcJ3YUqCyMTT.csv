roberts got a quick hand
hell look around the room he wont tell you his plan
hes got a rolled cigarette
hanging out his mouth hes a cowboy kid
yeah he found a sixshooter gun
in his dads closet with a box of fun things
i dont even know what
but hes coming for you yeah hes coming for you wait

all the other kids with the pumpedup kicks
you better run better run faster than my bullet

you better run better run outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumpedup kicks
you better run better run faster than my bullet
