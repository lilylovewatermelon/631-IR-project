yeah yeah
ooh ooh

verse 1
reminiscing i remember me and you we used to play with the dogs
while you were sleep id stare stare while you lay in my arms
and now im stuck on stupid rain forest couldnt get wetter than you get
i used to beat it up you gave me your love i abused it now im facing the music

prechorus
oh how i yearn for your touch
im so lonely now that you left me
if i could run away you know i would
and im hurting cause girl i never loved you like i should

chorus
when your love is lost
your whole worlds thrown off
when the one you need dont need you
what do you do when love is lost

verse 2
i was tripping wouldnt listenm now im sitting sipping shots at the bar
now im riding to the 90s hits listening to aerosmith
i dont wanna close my eyes dont wanna fall asleep 
tell me how i can i be fly without the wind beneath my wings yeah
