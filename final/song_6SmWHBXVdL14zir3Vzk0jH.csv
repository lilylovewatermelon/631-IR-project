verse 1 lena julia
starting from here lets make a promise
you and me lets just be honest
were gonna run nothing can stop us
even the night that falls all around us
soon there will be laughter and voices
beyond the clouds over the mountains
well run away on roads that are empty
lights from the airfield shining upon you

chorus julia lena
nothing can stop this
not now i love you

nothing can stop this
not now i love you

verse 2 lena julia both
well run away keep everything simple
night will come down our guardian angel
we rush ahead the crossroads are empty
our spirits rise theyre not gonna get us
my love for you always forever
just you and me all else is nothing
not going back not going back there
they dont understand they dont understand us
