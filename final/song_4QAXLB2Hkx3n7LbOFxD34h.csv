clock in when the whistle blows
eight hours ticking slow
and then tomorrow
well do it all over again

im a member of a blue collar crowd
they can never no they cant keep us down
if you gotta gotta label me
label me proud

i belong to the drinking class
monday through friday man
we bust our backs
if youre one of us
raise your glass
i belong to the drinking class

we laugh we cry we love
go hard when the goings tough
push back on push and shove
knock us down well get back up again and again

im a member of a good timing crowd
we get rowdy we get wild and loud
if you gotta gotta label me
label me proud

monday through friday man
we bust our backs
if youre one of us

we all know why were here
a little fun a little music
a little whiskey a little beer
we going to shake off those long week blues
ladies break out your dancing shoes
it dont matter what night it is its friday
its saturday its sunday
i just wanna hear you say
i just wanna hear you singing
yall sing it with me

we belong to the drinking class
monday through friday man
we bust our backs
if youre one of us
raise your glass
