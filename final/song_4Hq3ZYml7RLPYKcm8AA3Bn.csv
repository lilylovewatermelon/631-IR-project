take my soul take my heart
tear me apart
if im good for anything its all of this suffering
so use me for parts
to you im just salvage
i aint ran right in years
so drive me then gut me deceive and fuck me
then disappear
well take all my jokes
and tell them to them
and act like youre someone that could be someone
worth loving
and steal all the good parts
you found in me
yeah youll sell em quick yeah youll sell em chеap
hey youll give em for free
but i clеaned all my pistons
im running on 91
and im piecing myself back off the shelf
one by one
and now ive got a driver
who chooses the high road
they dont use me for scraps or throw my ass back
when i hit potholes

and im flying down freeways
going oneseventeen
and a 68 fastback looks like a hatchback
racing me

ah i believe
you cannot tear down whats built up strong now
thankfully
oh i believe
that you cannot tear down whats built up strong now
thankfully
