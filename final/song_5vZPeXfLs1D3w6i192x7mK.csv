believe me
i never wanted to be this way
never wanted to be this fake
never thought that id be this age
and fail so soon
well settle down out west
tshirts from lowclass outlets
posters we wish we were
and pictures of favorite stages
look at the cage ive been caught up in
look at the way ive been brought up
look at the pain i called
my god i never wanted it bad enough well

chorus
bury me in some fashion
in something fashionable
with a procession whose words
sound like a song i used to know
but never wrote
cause it was beautiful and predictable like

verse 2
how did two feet in the same boat
how did two keys on the same note
if you knew i wish you wouldve never said so
dont go faking it feeling it
feeling like we never were the realest shit
i dont see it that way anymore
see a mistake anymore
you might also likechorus
bury me in some fashion
in something fashionable
with dirt and words that
sound like a song we used to know
but never wrote
cause it was beautiful and predictable like

outro
oh oh all i ever wanted
howd i ever fail so soon
oh oh there goes all i ever wanted
howd i ever fail so soon
oh oh all i ever wanted
howd i ever fail so soon
oh oh there goes all i ever wanted
howd i ever fail so soon1embed"
