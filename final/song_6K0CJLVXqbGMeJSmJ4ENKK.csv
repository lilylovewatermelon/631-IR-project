seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking youre not pretty
but thats not true
cause i know you

chorus
hold on baby youre losing it
the waters high youre jumping into it and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you dont tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone oh

verse 2
i guess its true that love was all you wanted
cause youre giving it away like its extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh cause its not his price to pay
its not his price to pay

chorus
hold on baby youre losing it
the waters high youre jumping into it and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you dont tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone oh
