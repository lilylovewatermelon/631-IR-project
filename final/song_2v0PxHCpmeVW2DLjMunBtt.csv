my man dont want me no more
he said he needed a little time
to clear his mind
meanwhile im losing mine

verse 1
were at the crossroads my dear
where do we go from here
maybe you wont go maybe youll stay
oh i know im gonna miss you either way

chorus
its such a lonely road where do we go
we go from here
all i can do is follow
follow the tracks of my tears tears oh

verse 2
when i cry your name am i callin in vain oh
am i waiting only to drown in pain oh
dont you do it no said dont you leave me this way
i dont know if i can lift my head and face another day

chorus
oh its such a lonely road where do we go
we go from here
all i can do is follow
follow the tracks the tracks of my tears tears
you might also likebridge
usually not the kind of girl whos lost and looking for direction
who could this be staring at me
when im looking in the mirror mirror tryna find a resolution
are we too far gone to find our way home

outro
where do we go we go
from here
all i can do is
follow follow
the tracks the tracks of my tears oh
where do we go from here maybe you wont go maybe youll stay
all i can do is
follow the tracks of my tears follow either way
ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh oohembed"
