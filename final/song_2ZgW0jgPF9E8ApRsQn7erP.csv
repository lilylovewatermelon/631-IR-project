who knew we would be where we are here today
yeah who knew that your heart had a cost i would pay girl
aint gon be all peaches i thought all through the pain you would stay
i guess life is no fair no

prechorus
just listen to me we cant go on
pretending to be like were so strong
love gone gone with the wind
ive got something to give to you

chorus
black roses for this dying love
now were breaking up since we giving up
black roses an early valentine
special delivery just for you and i

verse 2
who knew our love would ever be called a memory
who knew my home for happiness would soon be misery
hate that were so distant girl do you even miss me at all
i guess life is no fair no no

prechorus
just listen to me we cant go on
pretending to be like were so strong
love gone gone with the wind
ive got something to give to you

cant sleep cant eat i cant erase the pain
cause i still feel your heart beat a million miles away
i cant think cant sleep i cant erase the pain
cause i still feel your heart beat  a million miles away
i cant think cant sleep cant eat i cant erase the pain
cause i still feel your heart beat a million miles away
