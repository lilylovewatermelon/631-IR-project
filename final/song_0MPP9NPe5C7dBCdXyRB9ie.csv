oh yeah

verse 1
baby ive been thinking
we’ve got two weeks worth of vacation
and im craving some vitamin d a kite on a string
lets get off the grid where our phone don’t ring
im talking orange myrtle pebble
on a blanket baby with you sea level sea level
come on to malibu i just wanna kick it with you

chorus
somewhere in the sand cold one in our hand
listening to a little beach bar band
singing dont worry be happy
how could i not baby when youre looking at me
with those eyes creeping in like that tide
getting me a rooftop 30a high
no plans just tan sun kiss loving it
covered in sand yeah ooh

verse 2
in the sheets on your feet in the shower
in the wind on your skin on a towel
on the bottom of a bottle in your long hair
lets get to getting girl

somewhere in the sand cold one in our hand
listening to a little beach bar band
singing dont worry be happy

no plans just tan just tan sun kiss sun kiss loving it loving it
