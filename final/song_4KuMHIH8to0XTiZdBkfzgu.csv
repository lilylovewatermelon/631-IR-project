heres a little story that must be told
and it goes a little something like this
this is a misdemeanor exclusive
if your radio is experiencing any kind of difficulties
turn the volume up
yes tturn the volume up
yes ttturn the volume up
this is an exclusive turn the volume up

verse 1 missy
its very necessary on the contrary
no you do not scare me is you drinkin bloody mary
for this you better hurry before i have to bury
my attitude is bitchy cause my period is heavy
i used to drive a chevy put twenties on that bevy
my nigga was the shit but then that stupid nigga left me
and now im lovin larry but larry go with terri
and terri is a freak but its his baby she will carry
the life he lives a fairy cartoon like tom and jerry
my flow is legendary and your style is temporary
yeah you need to worry like jason it gets scary
the words that i spit dont fit in that category
is my vision blurry my speech is very slurry
me without tim is like jamaicans with no curry
and yes its necessary so hurry nigga hurry
cause when this album drops you whack mcs will all get burried

verse 2 missy
your styles very crummy thats why you have no money

dont try to come before me unless you are a dummy
repeat youll lose your teeth and i would hate to call you gummy

thats why yall be discussin who i like and who im fuckin

verse 3 ms jade
i had a little homie named paul revere
smokes blunt after blunt guzzled 40s of beer
used to swear up and down every first of the year
he was gon quit smokin but he never did
watch yall huskey its about that time
gettin ready for the club round quarter to nine
couple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride
might spit like a girl but i hit like a guy
me and missy ballin up the avenue
funky fresh dressed to impress we mackin dudes
music biz only reason i aint jackin fools
you know bullshit walk and stackin rules
niggas keep drawin the streets keep callin
drink til im nice and uh uhuh onn

please do not try to fuck with this young buck
please do not try to fuck with this young buck
