the sun is setting and youre right here by my side
and the movie is playing but we wont be watching tonight

til the night i held you

i kiss his fingertips as im wishing hes all mine
hes giving me elvis with some james dean in his eyes
puts his lips puts his lips on my neck on my neck
makes me wanna give him my body oohooh

hes so bossy he makes me dance
tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
sweet like candy but hes such a man
he knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
and he calls me moonlight too101embed"
