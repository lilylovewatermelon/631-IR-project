isnt it cool how the summer fades
but im still here whispering your name
guess the heat drives people crazy
slip up and i call you baby

oh summers over oh
guess you wont be coming over oh
good to meet you nice to know you
nice to know you
nice to know you
nice to nice to nice to

verse 2
isnt it strange how the shade can burn
how you can go to school but you can never learn
you can fly south when the weather changes
well be birds in our separate cages

chorus
oh summers over oh
guеss you wont be coming over oh
good to meet you nice to know you
nicе to know you
nice to know you
