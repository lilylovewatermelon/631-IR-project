another constellation dies
do what you want cause its your own sky
just call me when the phone stops ringing
thanks for coming by
im just glad im on your good side
where its smoldering or freezing
its never all that easy to decide

chorus
this is the land of a thousand words
but it seems so few are worth the breath to say
except ill be looking after my own world
and you just keep on saving the day
ill try to stay but its in vain when youre far
im on the run to wherever you are

verse 2
and thats the nature of the chase
you fall so far behind you end in first place
pass the torch this time were running to eachs own regret
theresno harm in playing hard to get
boundlessness deceives me
baby you may turn the corner yet

chrous
this is the land of a thousand words
but it seems so few are worth the breath to say
except ill be looking after my own world
and you just keep on saving the day
ill try to stay but its in vain when youre far
im on the run to wherever you are
im on the run to wherever you are

im a gonna do everything i say
tried to stay but times running out
but now im on my way
to wherever you are
im a gonna do everything i say
tried to stay but times running out
but now im on my way
to wherever you are
im a gonna do everything i say
tried to stay but times running out
but now im on my way
to wherever you are
to wherever you are
im a gonna do everything i say
tried to stay but times running out
but now im on my wayembed"
