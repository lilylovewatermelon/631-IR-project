he drinks orange juice and vodka
in the basement while shes talking
to someone long distance for hours and hours on end
and as he’s slowly sippin he thinks about his children
and the heart attacks that youngest daughters always giving him
he ain’t smoked no marijuana since he got on with the railroad
and hes been on with the railroad for a long and lonesome while
but the day that he retires he will smoke himself to china
he will leave behind his worries as he races through the sky

chorus
the days are dark down in the holler
waiting for the sun to shine
on the back you have been breaking
trying to earn peace of mind

verse 2
she sells avon to her buddies and saves a little money
on the makeup shes been using to hide away the years
and she sits and watches tv usually every evening
if there aint some kind of ballgame that her daughter has to cheer
she sneaks menthols in the morning while her familys still snoring
and as she burns the eggos she looks back at her life
that heart she broke in high school hes singing on the opry
she wonders what the hell that she was thinking at the time
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
the days are dark down in the holler
waiting for the sun to shine
on the back you have been breaking
trying to earn peace of mind

verse 3
their youngest daughter stella shes running with this fella
that he cannot stand the thought of that he surely does despise
hes told her he best never see the two of them together
but it’s hard to keep an eye on her
when you’re working all the time
there are things he needs to tend to
and the bills the bank keeps sendin
lord the zeros on the end keep pushing further to the right
like a freight train hauling sorrow and moving ever onward
through the tunnel of forever to the never ending lightembed"
