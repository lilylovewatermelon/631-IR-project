verse 1
looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
i got so much time with you and theres more around
i know all the competition thats after you
so i get to thinking is this too good to be true

prechorus
that were living in a fairy tale no malice and no lies
baby ooh its hard to believe
that the love you have inside is only mine
thats how i know

chorus
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant

as im layin down with you every night
it still gets to me that you remain by my side
i aint saying that im not deserving of you
but i was dreaming bigger than i ever knew

prechorus
i wished for living in a fairy tale no malice and no lies
baby ooh its hard to believe
that the love you have to give is only mine
thats how i know

chorus
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
