in this house the decor is the obvious obscure
you can see clearly the theory of less is more less is more
a plant a pet and books on a shelf
and a frame on the wall where you can
picture yourself or someone else
and youre welcome to stay
but even your company must complement the feng shui

verse 2
ah even down to what i have on
they do wonder to what extents i have gone
tailored and tapered contoured to the curve
demanding the attention that it does deserve
fabrics for the forecast of the day
i admit it everything is fitted to fall in feng shui

verse 3
but more importantly the way that i move
if im in your town my needles down on the groove
on sight they know my song
and it aint slow and it sure aint long
you see i do not play
forgive me father i was forced out of feng shui

verse 4
a flow as subtle as a summer breeze
like the whispering winds and the talking trees
to big to be boxed in it bobs and weaves
it evolves it solves it gives and receives
and everything i say is calculated appropriated
written and arranged in feng shuiyou might also likeembed"
