my boy builds coffins with hammers and nails
he doesnt build ships he has no use for sails
he doesnt make tables dressers or chairs
he cant carve a whistle because he just doesnt care

my boy builds coffins for the rich and the poor
kings and queens theyve all knocked on his door
beggars and liars gypsies and thieves
they all come to him because hes so eager to please

chorus
my boy builds coffins he makes them all day
but its not just for work and it isnt for play
hes made one for himself
one for me too
one of these days hell make one for you
for you for you for you

verse 2
my boy builds coffins for better or worse
some say its a blessing some say its a curse
he fits them together in sunshine or rain
each one is unique no two are the same

my boy builds coffins and i think its a shame
that when each ones been made he cant see it again
he crafts everyone with love and with care
then its thrown in the ground it just isnt fair

my boy builds coffins he makes them all day
but its not just for work and it isnt for play
hes made one for himself
one for me too
and one of these days hell make one for you
for you for you for you15embed"
