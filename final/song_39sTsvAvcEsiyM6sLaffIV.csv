so here i go with the bass line low
nothing you can do we blew out of this town

verse 1
so lock it up lock it up cause were on our way now
and if we see one light on this town is going down
now do you see what i see
this place is lookin so very tasty
and i think i smell yes i smell a golden opportunity

prechorus
so when the dance gets hot dont look for reasons why not
come on in its time to begin whether your ready or not

chorus

verse 2
i dont know how far we came
but its time to leave thats always a shame
the pleasure was all mine if its all the same
were on the road you see were not on mtv
but when we get there we wont shave our hair or be fags like creed

prechorus
