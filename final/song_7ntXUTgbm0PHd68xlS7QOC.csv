her hair is soft
and her eyes are oh so blue
shes all the things a girl should be
but shes not you

she knows just how to make me laugh
when i feel blue
shes everything a man could want
but shes not you

bridge
and when were dancing
it almost feels the same
ive got to stop myself from
whispering your name

verse 2
she even kisses me like
you used to do
and its just breaking my heart
cause shes not you

chorus
and its just breaking my heart
cause shes not you
you might also likebridge
and when were dancing
it almost feels the same
ive gotta stop myself from
whispering your name

verse 2
she even kisses me like
you used to do
and its just breaking my heart
because shes not you

chorus
and its just breaking my heart
cause shes not you2embed"
