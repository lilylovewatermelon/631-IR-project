i thought some time in the sun
would help me get over you
but i could tell from day one
this is a place meant for two
now here i sit on the beach
watching the tide ebb and flow
i booked my room for a week
but now im ready to go

chorus
im in a tropical depression
ive got the blue water blues
cant shake this loving you obsession
cant stand this sand in my shoes
this forgetting you vacation
is just a fools holiday
if i cant get over you
this tropical depression is going to
blow me away

verse 2
this should be paradise
heaven down by the sea
without you here by my side
it feels like hell to me
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus

outro
if i cant get over you
this tropical depression is going to
blow me awayembed"
