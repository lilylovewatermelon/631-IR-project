ive held my tongue too long i cant do it no more i just cant do it baby

you must got me confused i treat myself way too good
and a love that tears you down aint really love

verse 2
every day im gettin up and makin breakfast
and more and more youre walkin in without a word
and every day im tryna ask baby whats wrong
