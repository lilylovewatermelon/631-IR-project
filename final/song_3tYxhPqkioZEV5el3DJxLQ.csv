its useless
i tried but to no avail
to tell you
how much i know how much i care
come home

chorus
breathe until your lungs fail
you can sing til you go deaf
everyday that you dont call her
i can feel it coming down

verse 2
i am sick
i am horrified at everything i hear
the youngest daughter lost her way
everyday repeats itself again
the cycle of our misery
it drives us all insane
please come home

bridge
the poison takes away from us
now youre sick to death from all the drugs

breathe until your lungs fail
you can sing til you go deaf
everyday that you dont call her
i can feel it coming down2embed"
