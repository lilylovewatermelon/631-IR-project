i cant speak and i cant listen
and everyone is a curse or something worse
what can i say to the kid that made you
complaining like you were made to
when you hate every god i pray to

chorus
so dont lie to me
i know im not as cool as id like to be
but why do you feel so down
again i know im not a very good friend
why do you feel so down
sure thats not something id stick around for
why do you feel so down
oh god i know you think im safe and sound im not
why do you feel so down

verse 2
ive gone weak and
im sick of speakin
so hear me out youre the cure
or something more
i think youre one of a kind so ill never like myself
i think youre older and wiser so i wont let you tell
i think it over and over and hope youre thinking too
i think it over and over and hope im over you
