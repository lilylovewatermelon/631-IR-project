yo i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hiphop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
shot grabbed the mic and try to say yes yall
they tried to take it and say that im too small
cool cause i dont get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then i jet
back to the lab without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the another one then i make another one
to diss the opposite then ask if the brothers done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i dont need a cigarette know what i mean
im raging ripping up the stage and
dont it sound amazing cause every rhyme is made and
thought of cause its sort of an addiction
magnetized by the mixing

but back to the problem i got a habit
you cant solve it you silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone thats thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like heroin
soon as the bass kicks i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and ill put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness beware its the reanimator
a menace to a microphone a lethal weapon
an assasinator if the people aint stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when im fiendin for a microphone
cause i take it to the maximum i cant relax see im
hype as a hypochrondriac cause the rap be one
hell of a antidote something you cant smoke
more than dope youre trying to move away but you cant youre broke
more than cracked up you should have backed up
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up
