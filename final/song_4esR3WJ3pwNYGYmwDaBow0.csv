the daughters father watches quietly we assume
hes no longer with us but he left this dusty room
in your name and its an honor its a shame but its your honor
take it on your shoulder til you can find another

chorus
thats enough for now he shouldve never left you broken
he shouldve held you things your father never could do
thats enough for now he wouldve never left you broken
he wouldve held you things your father never told you

verse 2
the century before you never could turn 21
years and years he waited just watching for a son
for someone to go ahead take the name he said
years and years he waited and a daughter came instead

chorus
but thats enough for now he shouldve never left you broken
he shouldve held you things your father never could do
thats enough for now he wouldve never left you broken
he wouldve held you things your father never told you

bridge
breathing comes in pairs
except for twice
one begins and ones goodbye
sixty years of sorrow he got five or six of bliss
left my mothers mother without so much as a kiss
as a kiss

but thats enough for now never wanted to leave you broken
he wouldve held you things your father never told you
thats enough for now i wouldve never left you broken
i wouldve held you things your father never could do
words your father never told you
