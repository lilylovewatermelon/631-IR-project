it started with a goodbye kiss
i shoulda just walked right out that door
then i wouldnt be sittin here drinkin
thinkin bout a bet i want just one more
then she woulda told me that
you never loved me anyway
then i might be in just a little bit better shape

verse 2
shoulda never turned around
looked you in the eye
girl you know it aint fair
that stare cuts me like a knife
shoulda kept my hands in my pockets
so i didnt have to give you one last hug
maybe then i wouldnt be so fucked up

chorus
goodbye means goodbye
no not see you around from time to time
and i know you hate to see me cry
but goodbye means goodbye

bridge
lovin somebody shouldnt have to be a means to an end
maybe it was just lust were better off as friends
i just cant get that last kiss off my mind
see flatland cavalry liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
but goodbye means goodbye
oh no no well
goodbye means goodbye
no not see you around from time to time
and i know you hate to see me cry
but goodbye means goodbye
oh and goodbye means goodbye

outro
started with a goodbye kiss
i shoulda just walked right out that doorembed"
