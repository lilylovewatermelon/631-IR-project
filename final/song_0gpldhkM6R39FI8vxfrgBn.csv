when my emotion grows i still wont let it show
i still wont let it show
even if im broke i still wont let it show
i still wont let it show i wont let it show

verse 1 tyga
uh nigga welcome to my life
life feels like im running through a red light
dont believe what the blogs write
motherfuckers wanna know me so they call me mike
im just chilling watching the fight
few friends fake girls pour me some ice
table glass slippers on lower the blinds
never been shy i just ignore lies
take a look into tygas eyes
i breathe love but inhale the hate bomb
so numb my face gone
i need my space and i dont do facebook
uh serious look how my face look
how could a man cry while the crowd looks
could you walk with me if i give you my foot
didnt think you could

chorus tyga
when my emotion grows i still wont let it show
i still wont let it show
even if im broke i still wont let it show
i still wont let it show
my mind overload i still won’t let it show
i still won’t let it show
people i love the most i still won’t let it show
i still won’t let it show i wont let it show

uh i dont wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal

like he aint ever go through shit we go through
so i guess now i owe you

but dont compare careers his and his fools
acting like i knew you back in middle school
dropped out mama said i was a fool
i brought the drop out now me and mama cool

oh what a feeling to be loved
oh what a feeling to be loved
i wish i could fly like a dove

chorus tyga

i still won’t let it show i wont let it show
interlude tyga
ive learned that people will forget what you say i wont let it show
people will forget what you did or done i wont let it show
but people will never forget how you made them feel baby

verse 3 j cole
cole world niggas praying for that heat
as the globe twirl gotta stay up on your feet
fore i say it to my girl i say it to the beat
then i play it for the world and they say that shit is deep
hm my life changing as we speak
they acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
i say peace hope it aint no sharks in my water
then holla at my mama man she love to see obama
do his thing now look how far niggas done came
they had us on the chains now we copping bigger chains
i aint saying that its smart old nigga dont trip
but they had with the whips now we copping bigger whips
oh shit wonder how bad will it get fore he rise
im out here trying to get rich i survived
and a nigga got god to thank
and im still throwing five in the tank nigga
