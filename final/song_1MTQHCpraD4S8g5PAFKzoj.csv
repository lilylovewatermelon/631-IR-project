no one knows what its like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
behind blue eyes
and no one knows what its like
to be hated
to be fated
to telling only lies
chorus
but my dreams they arent as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance thats never free

verse 2
no one knows what its like
to feel these feelings
like i do
and i blame you
no one bites back as hard
on their anger
none of my pain and woe
can show through
see limp bizkit liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
but my dreams they arent as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance thats never free

limp say it discover
limp say it discover
limp say it discover

verse 3
no one knows what its like
to be mistreated
to be defeated
behind blue eyes
and no one knows how to say
that theyre sorry
and dont worry
im not tellin lies

chorus
but my dreams they arent as empty
as my conscience seems to be
i have hours only lonely
my love is vengeance thats never free
outro
no one knows what its like
to be the bad man
to be the sad man
