shorty like a thousand dollar plate fine china
tell her that she beautiful every day i remind her
then i jump in her pussy like a lake im a diver
and her last man was a pussy had a vagina
i get lost in her eyes like dust from the skies

so if she leaves ima kill her oh shell die

verse 1 juice wrld
goin insane feel you pickin up and movin things inside my brain
i know i dont have to argue about everything
but we dont have the same soul

repeat it over and over until its in my brain
picked up the drugs so i let my brain go
woulda fried yours too but im selfish about my percs oh
