theres a lock on my cupboard door
that i can only reach once inside
and i often sit and wonder who designed
such a perfect place for me to hide

chorus
its just my name
its just my skin
holding a boulder
can you swim
oh as we fall
through the water
you find a piece within
and you know its just your skin

verse 2
well i was never lonely till the day that i was born
since that day i masquerade in a skin that i have worn
with at least three separate individual minds
when long john returns hell give a scream at what he finds

chorus
is just my name
is just my skin
holding a boulder
can you swim
oh as we fall
through the water
you find a piece within
and you know its just your

black dog black dog that ill never know
oh black dog haunts you mind your world your soul
oh black dog black dog cant you see i am fine
oh black dog black dog youre no plague of mine

chorus
its just my name
its just my skin
holding a boulder
can you swim
its just my name
oh its just my skin
holding a boulder
can you swim
oh as we fall
through the water
you find a piece within
and you know its just your skin3embed"
